Obama receives US
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teheran at dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the encounter , however , the conflict should also go into a conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been very excited for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continual Sett@@ lement and raises the lack of will@@ ingness to the peace process .
through the deal of deal with Obama by the Iranian nuclear programme the relationship of the two has wor@@ sen@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Netanyahu had given an controversial speech against the US Congress before the US Congress which was considered to be aff@@ ront of Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the talk was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this indication of the election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a call is professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a somewhat lower voice of the police , that he shot his friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet little dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the house officials , the officials found Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a hand@@ written note that I could still und@@ o . I loved Amy and she was the only woman ever loved . &quot; this was due to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , had already killed 300 miles to the school premises , at the door of his office and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ cies Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that univers@@ ality employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call ever after that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day there was another death : he took the Lamb , when the police joined him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after the shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to gain a picture of it which Lamb is motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , as well what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented but probably difficult teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; which he shared his academic life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both institutions set up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose upper body comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time there were some problems of proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if anything was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Lamb had asked the Delta State University to don@@ ate ur@@ inary for health reasons and said that he has some health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he made only two online courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; latest changes in employment policy of the University are important that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to be Assistant professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; univers@@ ality president William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wi@@ pers nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Tra@@ ce , when he went back to Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before he was arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t clear why he went to this house , but Johnson told she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb has grown in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the University , which employs 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , and enter@@ tained geography and pedag@@ ogy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received his doctorate in the spring of pedag@@ ogy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Bar@@ ston said that she was 15 and the lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried to teach her playing guitar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was at the time of the s@@ warm and s@@ warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls are melted when he was there , &quot; he said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson town of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said &apos; I have killed my wife , but there was no document from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning who was living with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left to 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ er about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lamb but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both in one summer time two years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse working for several companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes maintenance coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night at night , after killing his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before an annoying audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no indication for something that something did not voted .
&quot; just a happy couple &quot; he said .
we stayed at the ti@@ dying and talked with each other .
I mean they both have a good sense of sh@@ ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first @-@ term seminar programme and specialized in American U@@ na@@ tives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was chairman of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the municipality , participated in a candle celebration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Mah@@ n@@ Guard , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the classes are res@@ umed on Wednesday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was corrected to reflect the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call , and he was buried in his call to P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , and there was no indication that the two got married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michael J. Fox : let his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were sitting in the theater await the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear that Princess Diana is sitting beside me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in the sense that I &apos;m a simul@@ ated paraly@@ sis and a length of it from it to be with the princess of Wales in a date .

UN boss says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon states that his reply to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN Chief is calling for all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite , and support an inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five Member States of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , on the ver@@ ge of the General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian National Council , and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ touch@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an demanded the five continuous members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have proved in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Com@@ peti@@ tions that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to fire him as flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some public@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks among the p@@ olls , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means the chances of nom@@ ination of property Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election season .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump could probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed down to the growing Herman Cain , from which none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but global lateral groups such as J@@ eb Bus of Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump @-@ stamina and begin to flow up their dollars to collapse .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
dr@@ umps popularity figures have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans took the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten predi@@ ct that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures think in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week , that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of squ@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters are happy with dump than candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were only two of 10 saying that they would be anno@@ yed when he was the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as squ@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same over dr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied . &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment that would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees the temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is dis@@ cour@@ aged for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ulting foreign citizens , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for its president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is regarded in the first interim state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a commander to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent say that he did not do the personality to put an effective position and nearly six of 10 independ@@ ents that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they re@@ side their hon@@ esty and republi@@ can voters think it is real .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination according to a survey conducted by CNN / OR@@ C from the last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of July to replace their money on J@@ eb &apos;s Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless proves to be a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ ump Camp@@ aign as ch@@ atting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Republi@@ can accum@@ ulate through another candidate , Tr@@ ump co@@ ats more than any . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the broken field is likely to lead to Tr@@ ump tour , while the anti @-@ t@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates by diff@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump ref@@ uses the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he advantage ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before him Ste@@ eb , John Ka@@ e and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ on @-@ head race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans tells us , that they have formed their minds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters want support , say that they have given their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , much has happened to change that and nobody can really say , never mind the opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , change to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their opinions , are twice as often as dump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with dump in the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump , since two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump named immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; was the immigration of the public dis@@ course to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic re@@ print by Tr@@ ump Particip@@ ation , from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new @-@ orient@@ ing efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey on Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with qu@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so long as long as immigration is kept in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently to be done .
the fru@@ strations over the government has climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the assistance of republi@@ can voters , primarily by their out@@ sider status . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day @-@ survey of ABC / Post and they would like to have a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are even mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa has two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa &apos;s Repub@@ lic@@ ans were fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ content and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ king there is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street is a square meter of a hom@@ onym on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; means it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to Germany &apos;s top housing varieties , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Real Estate Agency Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square metres in di@@ zz@@ ying heights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are several hundred thousand Euros of nix - per square meter per square meter .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here not at the fore@@ front .

the squ@@ ad of the trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola gained their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to land@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ os ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves every chance with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth star success in series should be the first step towards the finale on May 28th 2016 , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to pick the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Müller received at his 28th match in the Champions League to Bayern management of good aid of Olympic vic@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto who had an regarded as flan@@ k das@@ hed shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not appreciate it , &quot; had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ blo@@ om fans - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sparkling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his latest six home games in the top class , among them against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia st@@ bled from Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , over seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they ran thr@@ illed by their obvious efforts but often too plain music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were frequently led by playing on the outside of Douglas , Douglas , directed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k made up of the right se@@ mit@@ one in the left upper side of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , when Olympic ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown struck the Pol@@ ball of Poland on the line ( 26th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then by using direct removing the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bayern dominated her familiar game you could set out Piraeus .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was arrested on keeper &apos;s Manuel Neu@@ er .
so about as he made a shot of Ide@@ as about the scar@@ let ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola was ordered a four @-@ cylinder gar@@ ret in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mario id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry . after muscular problems back to the Ka@@ der was sitting first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Hero gave a green light only after the gradu@@ al training , &quot; said F@@ ailed Matthias Sam@@ mer in &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something else , is already bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he &quot; King@@ sley Com@@ an for the eliminated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear by El@@ f@@ meter was still sitting on it .
in front of the game this was in the stadium to Kra@@ wi@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ plated Bayern fans in their audience block , obviously the followers of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures out , took the security forces and walked with sticks against the Munich followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes It has higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes it does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this is a long @-@ term study near Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : at ren@@ unci@@ ation the risk goes quickly .
smokers have an increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers smoking the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly , about 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che was higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scientists had more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum . st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and dental loss therefore go back on frequent to@@ g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
not to be clari@@ fied unless smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it could last for ten years , until the haz@@ ards dropped to the level of non @-@ smokers , the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to persu@@ ade people to be smo@@ ker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is good for lung and vessels , and leads to good dental health up to the high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population suffer from age 65 to 74 years , divided by DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking boun@@ ces the risk for early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists to@@ ast the Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on resi@@ dues from late anti@@ quity
an unforgettable finds have been excav@@ ated in Cologne on the right : Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rests of historical buildings were excav@@ ated , the Museum Director Marcus Trier will be on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the construction work on the Rhine hist@@ ori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
the museum has always been considered specialist service for archae@@ ology for all construction projects in Cologne .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard the archae@@ ologists were now found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century have been laying a church of Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the ruins of the fortress and church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs have been discovered that belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman records of goods
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman died in the G@@ eil@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen station , the federal police wins the population for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the railway station , and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the capture of the train , it has borne weak@@ est injury under the federal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was treated locally in a hospital and was placed by rescue workers in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal track of the young woman there will be no findings to the moderate officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident was possibly monitored by witnesses or residents have heard audible perception .
question : local residents or pass@@ ers from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn to bak@@ er bakery and Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Street ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission proposes in battle against TTIP new trial
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private transport devices for stri@@ fe between corporations and states are due to be solved by a transparent system , which corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens &apos; Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in charge of the EU &apos;s responsible Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before presenting the proposal as European negoti@@ ating talks , the Swe@@ de will introduce to free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP will be the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform current arbit@@ ration proceedings , in particular regard to select the EU states and the US jointly selected independent judges for a new investment regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they shall come to equal parts from the EU and the United States and from third countries .
it is also a second instance for the first time .
they would allow it to elev@@ ate the verdict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the proce@@ eding involved in each other on the arbit@@ er and a claims against their jud@@ gements were not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion over the past months , citizens have become apparent that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , she wants to sit down to an International Investment Authority in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there could be some disputes between Chinese companies and the EU states to be clari@@ fied there .
the investor @-@ ward arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) mainly apply from major companies as one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration shall be cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel , through the under@@ taking of tax@@ pa@@ yers , domestic laws or lowering of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act adopted the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they do not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreements with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) marked the plans in contrast to a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commission included essential points in reform , the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was on the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Association of Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the results of the economy may limit themselves to many new rules .
particularly small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged and named it .
when the discussions can be concluded via the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
negotiations are running since mid @-@ 2013 .
but the subject of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
a framework for the agreement was originally planned at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as no longer durable .
Bo@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens was sitting on the canal in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside him , a Flip@@ chart stands on which the in@@ timi@@ dly acting fol@@ k@@ än@@ ger recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt sti@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire audience for about 40 persons is nearly taken by Mr. Stev@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he rel@@ ates to various places , which he repeatedly showed on the map , what about its min@@ ut@@ u@@ tian and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where they came and how it looks like in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been re@@ produced to be a creative people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs that can be perfectly close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time great opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it arises as a sm@@ ells , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a bent series : each of the 50 US states will be sol@@ itary in succession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine , there was already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

convinced of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album climbed up to the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing the most influential music media in any year list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a productive experiments , Stev@@ ens moved to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic processing pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but programmed by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are nearly 2000 guests sitting in their seats , Mr. Stev@@ ens is returning to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without having a word to the audience , the group excellent musicians plays through the wide @-@ fortified album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the audience you hear : &quot; the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; record &quot; basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only at an en@@ core to Mr. Stev@@ ens , Stev@@ ens plays very few older songs and deca@@ ys finally under the big appl@@ ause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister , a tension of tension is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should enter his debut at the Prime Minister , and for the first time to David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise the first of his six preferred issues shortly after lunch , whereby his performance of the media is likely to be tested and the Labour MPs from the proximity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary report for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for she is coming to his appointment as a member of the shadow cable and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the decision of Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them commemor@@ ated in a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and stands in the centre of several titles @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he would have been standing in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the hero@@ ism in the Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadows ministers , refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , while less than a six @-@ th of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported by the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also within the Labour &quot; st@@ ack@@ ers &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limit of winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has presented to del@@ ve the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions minister , that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the ruling plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade has over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different politi@@ cian , says that he asked &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the questionna@@ ires of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front , and that it is made possible to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues sometimes gras@@ p the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ man , the speaker of the House of Commons in order to discuss the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron stated that he is involved in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre , &quot; but some years later he decided that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ as was regarded as the main barometer by the decision of a leader and his position among his parliamentary committees , although critics have been ar@@ gu@@ ing on a cartoon and have need to have sufficient reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pound climb@@ s by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound further increased to data , which showed an increase in wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 increased by the goal of the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
between May and July the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of last year .
this rate has been the fastest since 2009 and made it ass@@ ess@@ ments at the time of an interest in interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the rival to the rival had been received .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and make brands like Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ovice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were just under encouraging news from the competition for luxury goods by Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures suggest the expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry , have reported growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shares of G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE grew by 5 % after the mining giant told that he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a stock ticket as part of its strategy of debt disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , while Gold@@ man Sachs has had its estimate for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D sports rose by 3.1 % after the Sport@@ bag company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half year .
J@@ D Sports chief says that higher wages most vulnerable the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; workers could mean more buying power into the potential customers &apos; pockets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchase force will exp@@ el the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster depicting Lebanon to a potato @-@ range idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both - and indeed in the potato @-@ range driver who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ritz Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the tongue &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster by the P@@ EG@@ IDA movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and flesh put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the idea , a poster brought him by a P@@ EG@@ IDA demonstration with the inscription &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , in his shop a barbecue sp@@ it , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ i for the stomach &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has meanwhile been given to the Lebanese Office in Munich at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is protected by the authority , which has recently been protected as a utility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like plenty of meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better &quot; better . &quot;

Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ level campaign for com@@ b@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A @-@ branches from a Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A reta@@ iler in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di prepared two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ A tra@@ der and traders diving on board with brands such as Eis@@ dies S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop owners to sell the associated tickets for the South Australian soccer league .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will go through its annual Invest@@ ments Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ re @-@ IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ in transactions and higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ re @-@ IG@@ A network in eastern countries generate .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ically provincial and IG@@ A reta@@ iler disp@@ ose a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia compar@@ ing to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however analysts like Morgan Stanley are thinking that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets will take off around five percent of the food market in these two states and will mainly take advantage of existing retailers in individual retailers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A reta@@ iler could lose 360 million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 offices in SA and 30 in WA , and generated sales of $ 500 million in every market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in the food and grocery store , and in the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ &apos;s high fixing base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million winn@@ ings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares loses market share in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Morgan Stanley is increasing that Met@@ cas@@ &apos;s sales are sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 to fall by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and will reduce its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , went to Melbourne for a business meeting in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ funding refused to be able to reply to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass in public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 per cent to 14 percent since 2010 and received by about 1200 IG@@ A @-@ reta@@ iler since 2012 - it has fallen by 43 percent - which reflects the operating debt breakdown at the same time pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , wholes@@ al@@ ers denied and invest more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with hundreds of products each week and IG@@ A @-@ retail outlets in improving their stores through rapid growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ re @-@ &apos;s chief managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and charging recovery programs to Elan will be hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 , for the first time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Than@@ ks@@ ha@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis band Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ ks@@ ha@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ ks@@ ha@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; t@@ ear@@ thly damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick H@@ aly and deserves more praise for his own behaviour as criticism of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os which is always known as &quot; special KS &quot; became the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Cy@@ ril with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA for the spotlight at the Montreal Masters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati quickly , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated from the arbit@@ rators which Harrison had to suggest , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was last seen as he sm@@ iled a tennis ra@@ cket , he defended a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , was defended by He@@ aly &apos;s He@@ aly stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the single room behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I host quite a host is the fact that after my view T@@ ras@@ asi was stri@@ pped a little in the quar@@ rel , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lost a ra@@ cket , while he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has torn a ra@@ cket with himself and I know Than@@ ks@@ ha@@ zi enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , it really well behave in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a bit too strict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he &apos;s working very hard and he &apos;s fit in the locker area , it &apos;s good in shape , it &apos;s good in shape , it &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into consideration the important decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right to all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ lasting fixture to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe that Nick made him very soon to the public and made all the criticism of his work , but we will try to make him appropriate , but it is best for the team , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared Not@@ with@@ standing the border will keep refugees back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the border line with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all that tried to stop il@@ legally in the country . everything started to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials responded to anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who fled from violence , for an unknown time in a country strip at the road between the two control points of the countries settled there and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ strations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; opens the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were back from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that immigrants from Hungary would come back , during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a collision damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days conver@@ sations with Brussels and other countries , Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border made a day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c at a strict meeting in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who would eventually take refuge in the over@@ shr@@ inking Italy and Greece , that the EU states would eventually receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union to discuss the fluctu@@ ation crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a balanced action between Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two southern regions , the authorities called more powers to tackle the crisis so that they were able to lock up roads and speed asylum proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also has set up the construction of a bar@@ bed wire , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after it has ended up a fence on the Serbian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison prisoners have been used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable substitute for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , by Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , most of the coming economic refugees are insist@@ ing that in search for a better life and not war refugees , which are strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws which came into force at midnight , make the crossing of the border or the damaged base of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , who set the government on the southern border to Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the situation which originated through mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government overhead Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter by Associ@@ ated Press has already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs after day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor to Or@@ ban said that public authorities requested 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come across , having damaged the fence , they are now in custody and will acc@@ use the off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences against the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , Hungarian officials included two of the seven border passes with Serbia , after a tow@@ ing wire with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos re@@ opened the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke in Hungary as the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and put a crowd in order to push it up .
about 20 succeeded in killing and thousands stayed outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connecting both Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would deny food and water until they are traveling to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s ledge before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hillary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thus holds a double @-@ digit competitive advantage over the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her against the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) while unlike second place , whereas there is 27 percent ( rise by 17 per cent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet been announced if he had den@@ ounced the presidential office for the presidential office and receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to what candidates will assist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s Supp@@ orters are in its choice more decent than those of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton was lost during a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders took some profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and re@@ strained , but these projec@@ tions have dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your support among men has pl@@ ung@@ ed down , and S@@ anders here is just 5 points back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage for democratic elec@@ tors under the age of 50 has shifted , and they are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton had a big advantage over the older elec@@ tors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month , Clinton was always with a double @-@ digit advantage in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the national elections they could say , when they were nominated by the Clinton faction when she was nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support it with some preliminary keeping , and another 15 percent would only support them because she is the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are all impressed by her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger with those who do not support Clinton at present - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , Clinton had to support Clinton with enthusiasm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less Republi@@ can voters say this about their leading candidates in Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters have been asked in an open question , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , and that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval of dealing with problems and the fe@@ asi@@ bility is also quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president raises potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believe that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic elec@@ tors are asked of the elections , whoever would be their second choice for the party is bending at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers more than half , Bi@@ den would be far from scratch their second choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den , do not decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , will Hillary Clinton &apos;s ledge ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on five @-@ five percent of democratic voters , Clinton had to win the best chances to win the election ; however , this number decreased by 78 percent in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , in the question of what is more important for a Candi@@ date , Democratic voters want questions about the ins@@ ul@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to that in the last month , no one Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate considers that as un@@ acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates perceive good results for a number of important characteristics in the elections of their party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ aver cuts the best from among the three candidates of hon@@ esty and Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the guiding principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic voters of the elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during all these measurements , approximately a quarter of the democratic voters don &apos;t have any opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as any questions concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters were still satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the issue came light , split up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on her overall opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion seems even worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton had become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is regarded as hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
62 percent of voters do not hold it for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters do not see tr@@ ump as being non @-@ honest and non @-@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump gives you good notes at the lead .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best performing on hon@@ esty of the six tested candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority would rather look rather hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for the sample sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic elec@@ tors in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on nationwide survey of Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS news / New York Times hard behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of voters falls in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support migrants in large numbers . the support growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was carried out before Fox News debate last month in a survey of 27 % .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey showed that Car@@ son , in demo@@ graphic groups , well counts and dump of republi@@ can voters with university education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ ja , has fallen by Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who at the deepest time has fallen from now 10 % to now 2 % in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida @-@ Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % on third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fault mar@@ row at the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people of republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son enters the p@@ olls - he lan@@ det out in 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed g@@ ump significantly before Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having a view of one in the last week fu@@ cked car@@ son found some side@@ hi@@ bits for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ ze to ask Tr@@ ump belief in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need energy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperature : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to spot for a warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at maximum 17 degrees .
there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week for@@ ks the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
Bad@@ et@@ emper@@ ature still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes to up to 29 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic Sea , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings charged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ were filed against five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Stud@@ ents of Ch@@ un &apos;@@ Michael &quot; Den@@ g died in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital , which gave their death to his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound backpack full of sand , and was repe@@ aled , while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches : then he fell un@@ conscious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Pi @-@ delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to call his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to catch the national president of the Brotherhood to catch advice , said Police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ her@@ n@@ alia and in principle the less@@ ness of the Brotherhood led over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Police officer Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repe@@ ating strength of injury to the head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the Sch@@ ic@@ ans since 1970 , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important .
one County Grand Jury made by Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the third grades for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood ( including Mr. Men@@ g ) were charged with a criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the involved persons , but if there is an organisation - officially or officially - this will also come to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has ref@@ uted its affili@@ ation to the city group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interest rate comes , and the house@@ holder comes into the central banks , returns , and the economy will come into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the history for the economy is only a small guide to the exp@@ iry of the economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came to the first rate of interest within just 11 months , and lasted for 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve , when lifting interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of U.S. central bank have stressed that investors ought not to focus on interest rates when it begins to increase interest rates but rather on the time span needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several variables play a role in fact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , market participants could however tell that the whole excitement would be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal to the end of the &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at the Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest at normal heights , but still on a low level to the se@@ is@@ mic shock to which many seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy might react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate for a while can be volati@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment hits the increase is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to reduce assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a newer study that passes after interest rate in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the market has become more accurate in the last 35 years - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , slightly shallow in the last six days , with an average yield of 14.@@ 4 percent , while Bob D@@ oll , Chief System Str@@ ate@@ urs in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s released last six days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks will occur later , and the yield begins to reduce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rez@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life ; but interest rates are often present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the present case , the F@@ ed has faced some conditions which didn &apos;t exist before and that they could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the GDP will be close to its lowest point in a rate of interest at a rate of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate has been only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was by 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent to the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate at such a frag@@ ile economic scene could be ris@@ ky and reject the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have made an interest rate of the F@@ ed for the whole year , and all eyes were set at the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could make an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade are only a chance of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in our study all increases cycles of 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum during GDP and in pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists have taken very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade . &quot; so the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly long recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has waited for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , which was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market assumes no interest rate and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is , that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when bor@@ row , the returns seem to change , as soon as the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in the cycle takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the increasing cycle the bond ben@@ ds fall immediately and said Deutsche Bank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strateg@@ ist of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer and shorter demand , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credits often bring higher yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones thinks that the markets have already changed to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has changed to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , which has increased tor@@ ve , and the volati@@ l@@ ity has increased , and volati@@ l@@ ity has increased , and the volati@@ l@@ ity has wor@@ sen@@ ed its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt amounts to be worse , since an rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well as financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to react very positively to three months following an initial rate of interest , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts were in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ ders and low volati@@ l@@ ity at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage point ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are losing the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars outside the pure equity markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings may see gains through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions will be as fast as they take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM which says Andrew B@@ ingham
the preservatives Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender because of his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he ar@@ gued that he is no difference being different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ cked to the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only called The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ Kolle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the voice of The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; moves to Classic FM to claim a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do what the broad@@ caster do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ories of Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio stations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differ from its commercial cont@@ en@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I am not using the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn Classic FM . &quot; he said .
he turned to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously called examples , in which you are actually only what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC managing director rejected the accus@@ ations and ar@@ gued that BBC Radio 3 is in front of its commercial competition , when it comes to the public in live music and illumin@@ ating the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I learn of Radio 3 learn that I will not learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that really is un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to present the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and new works in order , I think that &apos;s really important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , would have to be worked to engage the audience when it did so in the past because the British in@@ forms more about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 was , however , not the only element in BBC production , during the assembly in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport with fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of € 22 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lord Hall was sure that the BBC &apos;s 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
he added that he wants the company to find a hit from our house barn - when the next time was a maintenance series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he ref@@ using to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or give funds from the fee for other consumer formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday may be responsible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last month the lowest result since the start of the record in 2000
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online sales increased three years ago through the use of cell@@ phones to shopping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts believe that the Black Friday was slow@@ ed down in November
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into gh@@ o@@ cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but experts say that there are signs of time record sales , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with just five percent increase from the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the growth rates for the previous years and continue until 2000 , the Guardian said Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales re@@ mi@@ xes the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated that online sales were increased by three years ago as buyer , with their mobile phones to make purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , this comm@@ its itself and we may experience that growth will be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the record sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will take their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and several dealer websites collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , who could stop the buyer because of bar@@ b@@ ating b@@ ins , buyers can make purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that 5 £ 5 spending was issued a little more than £ 1@@ £ online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now done over web @-@ shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of people buys clothing and shoes online rather than in the chains of the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca at the killed by the killed - Bin Lad@@ in family
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at first par@@ kings in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia speci@@ fies the collapse in some of the enormous sau@@ cep@@ an bin Laden group for load
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane has crashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered around the streets to bury the victims of the streets to bury the victims , who were killed as a crane at Mek@@ ong Grand lake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowded , crowded in white , the route to present their respect , as the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ sic cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ cession passed by the Holy place , where only days before a tree ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden disp@@ at@@ ted because of the disaster that was also 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead bodies of 29 che@@ ers , who were killed , as a crane crashed through the Great Central mosque Mek@@ ong , were carried by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m ac@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane under@@ scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr A@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials already told that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who continues to enter the city , go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand as it was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arabic version of the decree which was published by the government of Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English @-@ speaking Service of the News Agency reported this detail not saying that the business of the business abroad must be prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning this week , Sal@@ man v@@ ow to reveal what the overthrow of the crane existed , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later assembled in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden group did not have any statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for any statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal decree also touches the Group because of its current safety measures , because it has not co@@ operated with met@@ e@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca gener@@ o@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project which is managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the sovereign family of Saudi Arabia and assumed larger construction projects for decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a Ab@@ dre@@ am@@ ni@@ ger son who was de@@ commissioned by the family in 1990 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overthrow of the crane came in the midst of heavy winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
civil servants said that 158 people in the hospital stay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials assume that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to those of the killed members and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European ar@@ tis@@ ans is over .
British employ more ar@@ tis@@ ans &apos; accounts of Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has an increase behind them
this means that 200 additional screens shops may be opened on craftsmen that are target@@ ing tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales exhibit is nation@@ ally closing
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef Cor@@ respon@@ dent for Daily Mail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that Britain do their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern Europeans who perform works in their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully equipped with a hammer or brush to cut off walls , nowadays you apparently belong to a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because British employ increasingly ar@@ tis@@ ans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the tree @-@ strong chain , said that we offer a large increase in the number of skilled workers from eastern Europe , offering services to deep prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more screens shops opening on tra@@ des@@ people and close to 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment the men weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households , which are more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it is still working a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger into balance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions concerning the purchase of items by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a big role in the deci@@ ding process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also has its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has occupied exactly 50 percent of the teams competing with women , including its managing director and Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group received the costs for closing the shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to court
on Wednesday two functions of the Austrian Volleyball runner @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and del@@ etion .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with ministers .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel was cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the def@@ endants were dis@@ soci@@ ated from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , concerning them in their functions and used for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial support .
this fact was out of the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ sei himself judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for dis@@ solving the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence seemed that at no time an assets had emerged at no time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports function@@ aries would have been discontinued and the sports@@ club , for whom it had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , in which they had invested a lot of time and money in 2001 - the Pas@@ si@@ va in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue the club or lock ourselves up ? &quot; I told one of the def@@ endants and the financial statements of the financial report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money , swe@@ pt away our life of life as security at the bank , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed to : you can manage the money freely , it can only be made any debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance of charges brought back to 1991 was decided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the charges were cancelled only years later , from the year 2003 when a plus of the account has been paid out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Pau@@ form@@ - and not detailed devi@@ ations seemed to explain the former sur@@ geri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and austerity , def@@ aults the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not to be dis@@ closed the withdraw@@ als of the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial results , important was only the freedom of school , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , an amount of € 1@@ 20.000 was transferred to the audit account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants have been denied and explained the def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account ran on the names of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; she wanted to know the judge .
the question@@ er didn &apos;t know any answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , he thought he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happened to him , no one would have won anything of this money , the public prosecutor exhibited in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the co @-@ accused had been well @-@ informed of the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; claim @-@ repar@@ ation . &quot;
why claim in@@ dem@@ nity ? we wanted to know judge and prosecutor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first accused , had not agreed with this formulation , since the association never had incur@@ red a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far@@ ther also said the function@@ ary , he never hid a cent content , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Di@@ ets , he posed the Verein 1,000 euros per month in charge , but the actual effort was much higher , added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants were unable to submit the exact documents for the early years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were sent after an audit , in which everything has been judged correctly , not been preserved , declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all claims are done in cash , to do so , from his place of place to return to the bank to the ban@@ ker , he stated in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ acks more 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to three years of ongoing personnel reduction , the computer ri@@ b will be building on further jobs during the company &apos;s development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard &apos;s US computer giant ( HP ) does not end up .
the US technology group is planning to re@@ lie@@ ve the mining of 25.000 to 30.000 points during its restructuring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , the costs are saved at $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) and divided the company on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will inc@@ ur in the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the t@@ earing of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share was added to 2.3 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , the Group from California Palo Alto currently focus on : so the computer and printing business is still bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the access areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate clients , set the world &apos;s second largest PC producer in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third quarter of the financial year on the end of July , sales of both PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to barely 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 from 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive actu@@ ator on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man only responded very late to customers to buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and more and more shops do the same online .
Whit@@ es restructuring plans will see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5.000 spots in total .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the direct participation of German soldiers against combat operations in Iraq would largely re@@ sign in ref@@ usal : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent showed regular approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 percent are against the opposition to that in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with the Syrian ruling powers Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad sit 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
Auto : second pres@@ set@@ ag at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade fair center will be networked to 27 September , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars , along with electro@@ mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th international automobile exhibition under the slogan &quot; mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ er of the V@@ DA car association will count as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ös@@ h@@ ke : non@@ violence at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ h@@ ke T@@ rän@@ k@@ as and Water Est@@ abl@@ ish against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews Handling dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and a water designer was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started to throw in stones and plastic bottles after the officers .
officers first started un@@ interrup@@ ting pepper spray .
then the police used T@@ rän@@ k@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the Group was thus resolved .
the refugees have now left something gone .
one sw@@ ing@@ ere and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is observed if the US staff will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for nearly a decade will be raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , found by Reuters , found out that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed becomes more per@@ sever@@ ing and the interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ prising , Chief Emp@@ loy@@ ees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , cheap dollar is added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less corro@@ sive view of global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets , to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock CET on Thursday
death support at the Delta State University rear sign exc@@ uses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning , before he killed his colleagues and killed him , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note that &quot; he would make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he couldn &apos;t make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social education at the Delta State University , called emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , he shot on someone , and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said the emergency call on the emergency call that the police must send the police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , and he also noted that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; is in the house , but probably no one will dis@@ rupt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb has no explanation for his committees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the police scene there , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written notification of Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could get backward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I loved Amy . she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the Noti@@ fication , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him his own life on Monday evening when police arrested him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; univers@@ ality president William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wi@@ pers nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , Lamb is believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , &quot; Don &apos;t give you any information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triple &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced in 15 years , but remained friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s said a daughter , which is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s who had a dog named Light@@ ning took over for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she wanted to help other people &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police declared that Lamb is called relatives at a given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when police used him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a PhD candidate from the Delta State University , as his lifestyle at the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars that have lost their happiness
the actor ( left ) in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) had some st@@ ress@@ ant years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ term partner , Far@@ rah Fa@@ w@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also allegedly ended with drugs , and in 2008 he was convicted of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this invites for sure its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the group around
Lufthansa plans a large Group building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a half billion euros per year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone , with a better organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company will cost 150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives around the world .
the pilot union won &apos;t exist in the new negotiations .
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the trillion Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue , shared the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among others , there is no longer board member for passenger business in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the low @-@ start line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
you will be responsible for the CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr in the future . Karl Ulrich shri@@ mp will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the new line empha@@ sizes the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group will now be competing against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet .
until now the organisation of the 120 000 employees is complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , the airlines operate approximately 30 billion euros in its three quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tariff conflict with the cockpit of the pilot association ( VC ) , the negotiations on the courts were to be res@@ umed on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shared the union .
the topic of talks will be the retirement regulation for pilots .
the cockpit was &quot; one year with a predicted record result &quot; fastest possible to meet with portable results .
the conflict between union and air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
in addition to the transition supply the pilots the austerity concept of &quot; Wings . &quot;
it sees that Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor routes are re@@ located to the Group &apos;s official approval line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United may not play months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fac@@ ture of his right B@@ one at the PS@@ V Eindhoven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this was the left international def@@ en@@ ders to tears , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the field , and required oxygen when he was taken to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bass dress and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow or maybe a day later , he moved to Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is aw@@ ful - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then played fantastic and then it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy with a red map and the suspension of a mo@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli with the arbit@@ er and does not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ er had not mistaken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a eclip@@ se and a red card were pr@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account answered : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe , how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phillip Coc@@ o : the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves this kind of breach the place leaves , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our player to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg tro@@ op when she played at Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , it is not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing that I could see was the ball found in another direction , so that it looked like &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken into hospital , by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long , until you know it almost by heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked to call his favorite child @-@ book , the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , opted out by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice when Cameron speaking in a message on the super@@ camp site , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is always a book that I like to have missed out so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph describes the action of the book instead of Cameron attemp@@ ting to expand the new characters and details to enlarge the very short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of w@@ alled city of Th@@ nia @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Theodor Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , died in 1991 but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if this wasn &apos;t enough , the text of Cameron clearly presented itself as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally important and even the air is a commodity , hoping to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he gets to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron is a little familiar with the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a hollow one , who speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per which The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a down @-@ street speaker said that the text was probably come by the camera bure@@ au .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff but did not give any more direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England crew but it is still hard
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having to get to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res who has chosen England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test serial loss not on my card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a step victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ala@@ sta@@ ir Coo@@ ks site may be less experience than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ lefield list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars of 2012 only a young @-@ positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this related post : Adam Ly@@ th retired from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to initi@@ ate Adam Ly@@ th , is of course for me as his head coach in York@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple , but hard reality is that te@@ aser is aimed at results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long time ago we had extended the barrel of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hopefully if he kno@@ ck out more runs for York@@ shire , there is another chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ ze@@ h@@ ates his attitude , even though he did not bring so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is primarily a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test driver is awarded to set his character is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and backwards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can find was that England was first bet in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a bu@@ zz that I would like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at York@@ shire , at this season when he scored 2@@ 36 on us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to receive at least the same chances as they receive from him , but this naturally depends on the team building in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to hit Mo@@ een aside from Cook , which would get an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and received four Qu@@ icks , and I didn &apos;t think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a ra@@ mmer is able to beat , and that link@@ age has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s throw of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my former team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before starting in 2001 as an open@@ er .
he immediately made three hundred measures away and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ath@@ Ans@@ ari enters into the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see its statistics - on average 31 with the ball and 35 with the ball - and think , there is a big number of backup lines that raise their hands and the trainers have decided on youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few wise supplements on a train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka as a consultant for the trial games could be a master@@ head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est v@@ ests of the game which will bring an abundance of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is used for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has views from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing box , even if the news is in line with the previously predicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Coll@@ i team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers and I didn &apos;t receive a similar break against Australia and I do not have any problem for my part .
some will not agree but Co@@ aches and Team drivers do not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you need to remember that as with players , their jobs will depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken to the heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit from Britain from the EU ) could reach Zul@@ u , if the economy runs until 2017 in a F@@ lau@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in trouble with any day deeper into trouble ; even without the election of the gen@@ ius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who fell heavily on Tuesday through Europe .
Fore@@ ig@@ ners also have their cor@@ b@@ ying and Ni@@ gel Far@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ate told him that some member states , so deeply dist@@ orted in various crises , as the EU has now been drawn up and not always from their own guilt , Britain itself they did not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C was decided at its annual meeting even if it does not like the social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could call it also Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb up summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local size , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wanted to arrive outside the Britain in the interior of the EU , &quot; says Berlin - and letting us know that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s carefully thought German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a ally but she has been on power since 10 years before it looks out badly for it as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) and Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) is done .
French President François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his establishment in 2017 .
he is also an aband@@ on@@ ment force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alistic right government whose left was one left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to introduce yourself to prevent one leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British trying to stop the UK exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of them have no separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may not be able to deliber@@ ate some helpful notes , throughout the SN@@ P style , while the UK &apos;s speech campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won anything from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how Miss the Fle@@ et Street on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n . but in 1973 it was not supported by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is weak to Boris Johnson , who remember the ore Euro @-@ opport@@ un@@ ists who has made a name for a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all his comp@@ act@@ ness knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers , and p@@ seudo non @-@ indigenous people , belonged to most of our big newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but thought that if you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage allowing better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him , instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself , when Bla@@ ir had rejected the constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door after him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press never pulled him off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fla@@ p on the back in Westminster - I said that he had no time to repeat a mistake , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Bo@@ yk@@ ott , a mistake at that time and today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can last but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy in order to gain the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe - I &apos;ll express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ending dy@@ e tendency and the wild v@@ aul@@ ting of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television that week , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of prov@@ oked John McDon@@ nell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s years , when his old father devoted himself to his Labour Cab@@ inet in on television , without going too far and lose his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , &quot; remain &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what McDon@@ nell told his clas@@ hes and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what will also inspire the stir@@ red bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - the news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media , a breeding workshop of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no freedom of freedom for Europe , which allow him to stop lab@@ ours in the speech campaign for a self @-@ speech , such as McDon@@ nell told it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think surely .
but McDon@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ity in the EU membership in accordance with its anti @-@ capitalist past - not only a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents of the less@@ ness of dog@@ matic dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ity about NATO - Tom Watson , fel@@ ong is convinced that J@@ C won &apos;t be committed to the exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will try to make sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin don &apos;t waste political capital , but have also susp@@ icious voters to make conc@@ es@@ sions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ essly ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US is already disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government , which was re@@ minded on Monday by something of the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England over e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the British Medical Journal in their report about e @-@ cigarettes used in their report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have ques@@ tioned the capacity of the data and referring to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ wind@@ y basis &quot; to the P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers registered in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expecting that &quot; the current prime estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for multiple nic@@ ot@@ ine decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to obtain their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine products to a synthesis report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was called Euro@@ Swiss Health , who had previously received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report . they said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting , received funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they should have received before the tobacco company Philip Morris international , add them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but they include several popular E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which indicate a sector financing in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he participated in the meeting too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; is called by a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most of the criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however no these connections or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he said , &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way for smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Head of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said he had already responded to the alle@@ g@@ ations of BM@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life of life dies in its ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the evidence suggested that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to a small proportion are low , however , that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he has the clear duty to inform@@ ing the public about what the evidence shows and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to the tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people per year die of a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs two billion euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clear anticip@@ ation of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking will be accomplished by our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC to quit East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice Command . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast cost only should be used to make the kind of programs which are not sent by other UK @-@ transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC , that they are public @-@ legal programmes that probably can be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company had to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be an order or send him clearly from un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the broadcast cost , what I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should do its production at least on programmes that do not make or be commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they send The Voice in a first time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is natural sense of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why it is a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs that could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , and both own productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm .
I try to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC .
Johnson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , said Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will work on the hunt of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give you back what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ch@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 struck the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs are to go to BB@@ C4 , but they are able to argue their jobs , and they might argue that they have seen all these overhead programs which no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more rainy system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , think of all that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is right for £ 150 for £ 150 , ask me whether this is correct , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC will examine their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate them and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little by BBC @-@ production would now be classified as a formation - he said that it should change 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio , and it should change this in &quot; inform@@ ing , inform@@ ing and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful in television should come down to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ ak@@ &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ ds change the direction in the moment , where they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have bred saus@@ ages in genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny Nem@@ at@@ oc@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they have too high frequencies to be heard and ir@@ radi@@ ated to the human ear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultrasound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another focus on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said the worms and the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ as , which can be used with ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Srebrenica @-@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain in the brain of treating Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ail@@ worms are usually not on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made it clear that they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , strengthen ultras@@ onic waves , which would then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ampli@@ fiers effect on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the Wür@@ mer@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves effect the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate cells , which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ z@@ ani are genetically the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels are found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he turns ultras@@ on@@ ically to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to worms , where they change the changed mot@@ ion@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure has several simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ graph@@ s , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables researchers to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ sta could have some advantages over this technique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound wave can happen without hin@@ dered and can be sent up to the brain from above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily reverse human neur@@ ons due to the ultrasound signal for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; says Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , to take bus stations and into the subway trains and which require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with the D@@ LR station ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of London Under@@ ground and the trademarks of the D@@ LR line , which turns into the image of a Panz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a crowd of arms dealers with the D@@ LR pass ... clients will be asked to help the cease @-@ trade fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists make themselves involved with activists within protest movements to work , and notice that they have to go out to the world outside in order to have an influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters will greet the comm@@ uter in the subway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and has been working with the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , the char@@ itable with the artist and Vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who is also working for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creativity , Matt Le@@ ver was amazed about the silence that there was around the advertising for the weapons fair - and thought , &quot; Let &apos;s give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic delicate company advertising , but &quot; by tw@@ ining with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by focusing us to shar@@ pen@@ ing awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices on the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step forward of the British government , and the guarantee that Fol@@ der devices cannot be traded illegal prior to our door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibit@@ or is fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in dormit@@ ories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , I moved to the student residence as self @-@ forgotten , but only now , I remember the called sm@@ iles of those who have upset me - and to the numerous , long and leg@@ ory complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of what I learned is can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student dormit@@ ories reaches from easy @-@ to @-@ wra@@ cking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to s@@ wat@@ ering : people tell you where you get to know where and where you don &apos;t love Sab@@ b@@ ite , because in Ernst , boys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the conversation and helps you to find people out of those who would not speak in contrast to those who would not speak , even when your eyelashes would fire on fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
leave people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms of people often transform into beverages , film night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people attract attention and put their under@@ garments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relation to this : do not think about to start your university with a relationship .
intro@@ ver@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ asting culture that can lead to life and social and to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone , trying to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to go away , so that I get away the energy I have consumed with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send SMS to him a text instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you begin to start the Uni at the climax of back @-@ mania , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood &quot; I have something baked on you . so , and now , please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to talking and will end , perhaps , to associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put po@@ or@@ ly mixed l@@ umps from flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping , if you kno@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to steal food is an ongoing crime in student residence .
of course the cl@@ ause of chickens is a theft but is it taking a drop of mil@@ x for your tea as well ?
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances are good that they say , themselves , even if she cook in the midst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to balanced out as my mate , who added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not make any noise , people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb we belong to the people that sit in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them somewhat more silent , so it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they acted on it with even more lau@@ tern music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they woke up at 5 a.m. , she allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she shut up their own music , shut up their door and went to her three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be acci@@ dental to the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ al , if you would have to separate a room@@ mate for your future sp@@ ouses to change her again and take a look at how they over@@ take all common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart is its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partnership , try at least to talk about a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the exciting moment in which you are not@@ ing that someone has its keys in his closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ ing f@@ one appears as it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good fight is fun , but it only takes you to look up to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security , but never fail@@ ing someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and put your keys in a glass of water which you then establish into the freezer - but do not fli@@ ck@@ ering your dom@@ inions on the blanket no more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es ; single @-@ th@@ ri@@ ages
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a wealth of money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees too - but also as signal , &quot; not only refugees need residential room , but also the alone Mother and the L@@ ing@@ earned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and building well today &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner thinks to know how rapidly even the living room can be created , built in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees to push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ na@@ si@@ ums has no sustainability .
because people are staying in a great part here .
in the view of the refugee flow we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very smooth , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
it is different if you put the people in the living blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses , which are built straight in a pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each unit has two bedrooms and a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees shall say , it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the houses can easily be converted to your needs .
how much are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euro without land .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building legally en@@ forced my project correctly .
particularly complicated it always makes the threatening dam@@ sel@@ ec@@ cl@@ ause special construction and parking space .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will still be under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in cities is enough for this place .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their Town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who were accused me to create luxury interiors for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not intensi@@ fy the competition to affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however : we have been building a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but one could hardly afford anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my project has the message that also the normal people need living room .
not only refugees but also the alone mother or the st@@ ing@@ th@@ ener .
I show how to get cheap and well build today .
that is why it comes .

iOS 9 : how to obtain the new iPhone OS as Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested to go to &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready for you to download and install the option to download and install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are pushed forward to the installation , because they get an error message that tells you the &quot; software update was failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait either until the attack goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be possibly causing the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has to put it more unlikely to do so if you install a special tool , and then install it , once the process is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it pays to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located near a charger , so the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the load is too low , Apple won &apos;t allow it to pass , since the telephone may be switched on half way , and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

2009 and last year the 30 year old Brit@@ on gained the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the current Smo@@ g in the city state is to have an influence on Singapore , the current Smo@@ g is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago , the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ fre@@ unde Bath Kis@@ singen &quot; has included another member in his ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stays in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur for 40 times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Kis@@ singen , G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has assisted G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation from Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this it is possible to record chess players , which cannot be able to record the member fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

district office seeking direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ er Anton@@ isti@@ ft has joined the foundation of the Social Fund and opened a new agency at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation is desc@@ ending from the mountain into the city center .
more precisely to the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there recently opened a new district office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right next to the shopping market , elderly and counsel@@ ing information will immediately get questions such as care security or services of health and nur@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have established ourselves with our out@@ patient care services that often they are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely many achievements of the insur@@ ers are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of the insur@@ ances were not even understood as the &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; business hospital and for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the deliber@@ ations , the new district office offers prevention , health professionals and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of them was taken into the Sal@@ u@@ dis by boat .
therefore one can use additional offers such as n@@ g prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment .
the old people &apos;s centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideal in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab .
&quot; the home center for the care and care &quot; says Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the basis for the opening of the new urban district office headquarters in downtown , both of which were especially in demo@@ graphic change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this one has become a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he distinguished by mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office will also dedic@@ ate numerous events and offers to the programme and they invite you to a regular meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Social Fund allows a large contribution to sen@@ iors to live as independent and well in their trusted environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ .com is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 am , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 am to 6 pm and Saturdays from 10 : 00 am to 12 noon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men test on 17 years of Afghanistan
witnesses for the police are looking for an incident at Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening at 23.@@ 45 p.m. three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ ani , followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
three people also stopped at the premises of the petrol station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men cried out to the young people , and hit his fist on this face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was suffered from nose and blood @-@ bleeding from the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his two friends were sitting and jud@@ ging on the ra@@ cket , this first spoke of his victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his last young man was brought home from his friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crimin@@ als followed the group with a car up to their flat , and drove past there several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle , the last one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under conditions of stroke it was measured on the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured one had to get medical care in a hospital .
so far only a vag@@ ue issue was found .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 metres in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres in size and was clothed with an je@@ ans and a brown white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice field breaks and invested 3@@ 10.000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows .
also Sam@@ t@@ Community mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann is pleased to award artists in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz und As@@ bury &apos;s Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places in the country , doctors and As@@ endorf are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field on October 1st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ast@@ ausen re@@ tire , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in his successor over half a place in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a reconstruction work , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy to first look at first glance at Frank Müller and whose wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who at present completed her medical training in the her@@ ent hospital and will also join the practice in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash were well fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ breaks and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far I simply called her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the couple of Müller , the idea was pleased to operate the own practice in As@@ endorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the proximity and the permanent contact to the patients are very attractive to us &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
he sees himself as an advantage soon to be his own boss .
and so one became eng@@ ed ; the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
of course they will continue to dwell in Mun@@ ic @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ time family father , Frank Müller , was born there in several medical practices and hospitals in sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed for conduc@@ tors in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed to volunteer in the DRC parameter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen works as a family physician , his wife Ur@@ sel ( inter ) speci@@ alis@@ es in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rub@@ ber@@ ers - both inter@@ ni@@ sts and want to settle down as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ onic investigations and long @-@ term loading and exposure @-@ EK@@ GS and need a speech room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of EUR 50@@ ,000 will receive a subsi@@ dy from the district circuit ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the community base ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice goes on further . &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ Community mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice field breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another general practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice relating to Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the k@@ itt@@ ens according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , it would have been gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were visiting the 80s , will also watch in trusted faces : over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power of the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their departure in As@@ endorf , an era ended in As@@ endorf . after all , the medicine worked for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms - Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ breaks are re@@ minded .
a little sad@@ ness can feel it after the long time .
&quot; but we are living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients for sure &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
her husband comple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now I have pushed me with gardening . now that could be different . &quot;
the pair also has two grand@@ children and travels to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also driven on our border line &quot; said the Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application should be &quot; of course , &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provision of the safety and safety of human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we don &apos;t accept limit@@ less mig@@ rat@@ ory flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced to continue mig@@ rat@@ ory refugees towards Austria and Germany , also to er@@ ect cor@@ ridors for refugees under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however this Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach however did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the border of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the mini@@ stries stressed , Sloven@@ ians would not want to bor@@ row its limits for refugees however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member has to fill its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours to pass the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police triggered them in the near maize fields .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , since then in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars were constantly rising with new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly used for Syrians and Afghan persons , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country counting its land with some 4000 refugees , he said Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would agree to the Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ically Serbian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , agreed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade was convinced that it is possible to strike certain routes , &quot; neither can we , nor will we do this , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with approximately 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night taken by Serbia around 500 kilometres away of Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police declared that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the ob@@ servers already predicted the shift in the past Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia into a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive capabilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian minister of the Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a strong fe@@ eder of refugees appropriate plans for possible ou@@ tre@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not name details , but he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive capabilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have gone through a good testimony to the country since it concerns the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side there are around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border press .
according to the media reports they reported the last night at the border @-@ crossing of Hor@@ eg@@ i@@ ali which leads to R@@ ös@@ h@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border @-@ crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees are now looking for the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was still trying to calm all over alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature ejaculation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would not currently be a high number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey on Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers would rate migrants to - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to spread the refugees maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian group there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent in the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stock market h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukrainian pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ p@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als , who has been previously fore@@ seen since 2010 to have some un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the saved information will have been placed inside the financial markets with the captured information .
the investig@@ ators have officially launched a total over 100 million dollars in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those who are finally caught outside our country borders , &quot; says it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused were performed in the event .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are expected to come from both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid Mannheim has been there for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz is a lively operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people get their bes@@ ity , partly quick step@@ per , partly cosy glo@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Autos@@ al@@ on at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keeping the city railways .
puls@@ ating that keeps life in beautiful autumn sun and middle of it four large boards with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot; ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice made attention to its 20 th anniversary and confron@@ ts itself with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid is at the disposal of the quali@@ fiers , as well as for questions and discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while man@@ ch is a threat to the chal@@ k and the set around &quot; my life affir@@ med , &quot; &quot; continue to stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue to stand , &quot; say , &quot; phr@@ ases like &quot; so far I don &apos;t go and then go further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge little discussions develop over the action , on the life , the handling of dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I make clear that for me sometime the end of this world is coming , I can assume a responsible person , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Link for the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this public relations with the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that not everyone wants to inform each of the tables , be understand@@ able , and finally handle it a very personal business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death and dying was very angry with Tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed to the fact that people open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ ds .
the death and fun@@ eral pro@@ cession belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by personal experience confron@@ ted by the subject , she read much literature and decided to engage themselves in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice was looking for an official call , she immediately reported and had been with the creation in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ che &apos;s team belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the participating and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ z St Vincent .
they are all carefully educated .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ et can well deal with her job and experience experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ n , hold it for precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice is free of charge and sec@@ t@@ arian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of members and clubs allows the training as well as trainings and super@@ visions of the death and tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
training will be offered for new employees every two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boards described on Saturday were now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings mixed , financial outlook for 2016
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the delivery of delivery to a whole year because of its weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in its transport service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that it plans to burn about 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for vacation today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex proclaimed that the company aims to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share fell 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening will be opened on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Anno@@ un@@ ces a gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cents less than in previous predi@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts were expected to generate a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower view increases , despite the price increases , aver@@ aged an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and increases in spite of higher supplements for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packs that will be collected from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that the result was expected to boost its result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soli@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; finding the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for vac@@ ations for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to stop 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research surve@@ yed analysts predi@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks responded to analysts at 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ bility to st@@ agn@@ ate revenues in his unit express shipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was relatively shallow because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Express unit received higher wages due to higher prices while the result was caused by higher labour costs in the cargo shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares rose by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Federal Reserve &apos;s most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist sat around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time ever since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening about them in an end of the galvanized , two @-@ storey sitting room is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold contract from the Congress : to maxim@@ ize U.S. jobs and prices here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the Great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct it . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the un@@ preced@@ ented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most data of the economy show that they grow solid , the youngest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might be fri@@ ghtened to rein@@ force this vol@@ ity by the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of interest for federal government - and be it only by one quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the job market and inflation will be the most important what they observe , &quot; says Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Head of Mak@@ ers Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were looking for an exc@@ use to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty concerning the global market is enough to wait , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , the financial market is very uns@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately half of the econom@@ ists , which were ques@@ tioned about Bloom@@ berg , have predicted that week for this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist cuts the blow by increasing that further increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jump@@ ed at 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics imp@@ lies the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this point , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , it would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts ar@@ gued that a interest rate would be calm down the financial markets , because they would deal with certainty when the F@@ ed will act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before one month the F@@ ed seemed to increase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow pro@@ clam@@ ation of the monetary policy that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase of the proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement is solid on the labour market this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and in the vicinity of the level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage gains have shown evidence of a recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly proce@@ eded under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can master higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets all over the world were gathered together at the end of the last month after China had dev@@ al@@ ated its currency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dow Jones Industrial demands fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would imp@@ ose global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has slightly recovered this month , and the Dow had now risen by almost 10 % below May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ence influence the market turbul@@ ence when they increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when events would not have occurred on financial markets and the news about the weakness of China &apos;s economy during the last couple of weeks , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that they are waiting for at least one month to get the impact better , better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the impact on the US economy and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world &apos;s health is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the final effect the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed can expand their monetary expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being negotiated together , they can not only monitor the developments at other sites , but also with other central banks and experts , to ensure better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Management of En@@ y@@ net , Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ response in financial market movements that are not linked with economic foundations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acker , agreed member of the Federal Open Market Committee , sett@@ les for interest rate for interest in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its guidel@@ ine by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite reduced effects on growth in the United States , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should focus on top of financial stability only during a serious crisis , as the market crisis of 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen said , former member of the Committee on Com@@ peti@@ tions of the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the youngest turbul@@ ences are not in the proximity of this level he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets wonder@@ ed , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think she should anticip@@ ate the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small help for refugees
ever more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
being a warm welcome which does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who are useless to asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she still likes to teach with her 74 steering .
every Thursday it does in asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is quite different lessons than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande supports food for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SP@@ RS , Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation period is . you do this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all nutrients which need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase its daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ ylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating in fact affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately a healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro @-@ wide sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; planned for long awa@@ ited gym@@ na@@ sium building , Bern@@ ese sports field move step forward : during the recent meeting of the recent meeting the building contract was unanim@@ ous in unanim@@ ous discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , the panel had already adopted a resolution on a legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form in the roof construction .
a &quot; S@@ addle roof with non @-@ provided first and roof terrace is therefore to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the intended use of the roof panel for solar systems : &quot; through this we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; says Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , the roof is to be prescribed for energy reasons - different from energetic reasons - other than in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
&quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan should not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; because the Bern@@ ese municipal council usually goes on to liber@@ ating treaties rather restri@@ ctive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports center of the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated to cost .
subsidies are expected from school and la@@ titude promotion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next proce@@ eding , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the State Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg was supposed to be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became a new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is seeing the surprising plans of the Hospital of the district , which confirmed it by Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Supervisory Board will make a decision on the Supervisory Board and the Member States will pass on Wednesday 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plans have to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees will continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of soldiers with fishermen and the next existing station to move to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees who are not able to get to Sch@@ ong@@ au shall be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change has caused the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the question who will succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game that was ready to take over and move to Sh@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this happens in every event a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fishermen are a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ al diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next two years Fischer , with his team if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to find both houses , which has more than 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years have finally closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ kreis had planned this to date in 2018 if the ongoing renovation was closed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met , and the house which is owned by the federal bank will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say , there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a meeting of Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better does not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi &quot; move to the Le@@ ch who was educated by the employees &quot; positive and understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor since more than 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked to be asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take out the position of the medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure and departments , for example , surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Li@@ ons are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wuppertal the table name of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the past season , the B@@ HC became a painful defeat and have ben@@ ign there something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hunting case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest by shots .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn box at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) there were several hunters in use as the police cleared .
after a shot of arms a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as precisely as it could come to the accident , it was un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the det@@ ective police determined .
mis@@ ses 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz victims of non @-@ violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Tat@@ ars led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the 20 year @-@ old , the young@@ sters have killed and their glue thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a non @-@ violent 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been victims of violent crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body of young woman was found on Tuesday evening in rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , like pro@@ secut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pro @-@ susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old friend who has indeed tra@@ pped the statement , and the investig@@ ators went to the place of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after a visit to a fall festival in rock@@ enh@@ ausen last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in search of the young woman the investig@@ ators came to personal bel@@ ong@@ ings at the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the circle of friends in friends and fame , a crime fiction against the 20 year old was missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpet@@ rators were then led to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceremony was report@@ edly to have killed the authorities in the police , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the body placed in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday by the Haf@@ ner , the investig@@ ators make him dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consideration of the circumstances of the fact should bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing .
the situation on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a affordable lead .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the fair competition on the German residential market have begun long ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and working people from the EU , more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income citizens to compete for the last affordable housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial includes a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees cannot be obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ er in an independent private accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many go to the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the negative development of the apartment market is not just the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , the apartment is expected to increase when the year is bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently some 77@@ ,000 units were currently missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , but compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many professionals were living in large cities where they were held at WG @-@ rooms .
young adults were staying in the apartment for no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the large cities the number of square metres per capita in recent years has fallen back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to resolve the issue , the Alliance suggests &quot; social housing &quot; to re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incen@@ tives will revi@@ ve the social housing .
thus the basic tax rate could be wai@@ ved and the fundamental tax for subsi@@ dised flats are limited .
an alliance makes an attractive tax transfer possibilities required .
the funding program for mig@@ rant groups of automob@@ iles Kf@@ W comes across as well as cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start was already announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project might even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia judge a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no circum@@ ference is coming , since more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announced to announce the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia intends to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Interior Minister , and if it is necessary we can organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sealing off the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which come into effect on the same day are unnecessary asylum procedures practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police launched the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , Syria , Iran and Afghanistan reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxes in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the refugees are not bor@@ dered on Gren@@ zz@@ an@@ im at the Croatian @-@ Serb border .
this hi@@ des other dangers : there are yet sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ fields should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police managed 3@@ 66 attacked people .
on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 people on Monday .
the new Hungarian laws levels take over@@ coming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as an off@@ ense .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eged .
the convicted imp@@ ending sentences up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were applied on Tuesday in the newly @-@ called &quot; Tran@@ sition &quot; in total , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicant were 13 families with young children and two older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no one has more view to get asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungarian view Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers are to be scre@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sition one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ h@@ ke , a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers have begun to wake up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage to leave the tenth of thousands in the last weeks on the road .
pl@@ ywood @-@ screens were disman@@ tled and one of the admission ag@@ ro@@ dent in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary is only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but around the 20.000 migrants were still in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing several smaller groups of refugees meet on foot regularly .
Mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ stran@@ ded &quot; on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the Auf@@ zucht , when ten people faced with Reis@@ ek@@ els at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists and they wanted to go to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany was surprisingly supp@@ ressed because of refugee flow in Austria because of the refugee flow , the city was immediately offered by its help and the stran@@ ded with two hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into Na@@ he Pas@@ sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , we had tasted the uns@@ killed guests only once , with j@@ ause and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have said the same thing we take them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; of course this was a city for us - &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man could not accept a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that was very pleased &quot; so Stad@@ ler told us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the short notice of the Ann@@ enk@@ o had risen by a ICE in W@@ els from a ICE train to Pas@@ sau , at the short notice that the railway traffic was dropped to Germany in the short notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regional train was transferred to the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein near the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest joined the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , in the previous day a two @-@ sle@@ wing focus - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending more Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us , a logical outcome of a poor policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than in store R@@ ös@@ ke at the erection of structures to help human@@ eness , our Chancellor has officially been decor@@ ating the position of the Hungarian government in the National Socialism of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ cing these policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the border regions with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the poultry will state that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which they invited , welcomed us nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge , in view of sustained refugee streams and the near@@ ing winter , for us to produce decent states for refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater to maintain peace and security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ y quar@@ ks
Konrad started to do with the carrying out of all hands .
Christian Konrad is used that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to exhibit Qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
chaos in the first resort of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen had already been able to get a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were carried out without great vort@@ ex , Konrad and praised the organisation of the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior of the Interior however talked about a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad achieves an average of 8@@ 5,000 lateral quarters in the he@@ avi@@ an year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , some 5,000 accommodations were to be found over the coming weeks - 20.000 the countries provide to make 15.000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should there be more refugees to make it happen .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground &quot; &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led discussions with the regional authorities .
they would have promised him for the future refugees to create qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; he runs well in Upper Austria . &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born will be informed , as the church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expec@@ tation sets the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator as well in the ORF campaign , &quot; helping them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer simple accommodations .
one also hopes to be back in hotels that are vac@@ ated in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier received the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ s must have a certain height of the hand @-@ ch@@ holder or size of the th@@ ec@@ tor@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; emergency standards have to apply for temporary period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the Ministry of the Interior , he was successful , founded Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not able to speak without further into the face of ignorance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convic@@ tion force is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier , the Republic do not cause any costs as they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their number of employees will increase it to three to four .
so far the unique qu@@ art search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to make a container office at step@@ han@@ splatz as office .
there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena , and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since one can currently under@@ estimate the person without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further locations are to be tested for the emergency .
criticism is the Head of Refu@@ ge@@ es at the division of refugees within the federal country .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone line with the Bavarian Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Authority of Authority ( CS@@ U ) has de@@ coded the further procedure in the refugee camp on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has insured me that the German limits are not sealed .
the continuing education of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
but there is now the corresponding limit controls .
there will be no more che@@ aters with refugees to Germany anymore .
however the seek@@ ers were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ lers has called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Austria has to introduce controls to his boundaries , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of the prec@@ ursor of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general shi@@ pyard of the &quot; New shi@@ pyard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the wise heads are our raw material , and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Group Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could imagine , invest in startup companies of the New shi@@ pyard , and later to become ac@@ qui@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which is what a lot of reasons promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site to a 3.3 million euro from the Tech@@ Center which is one third of the city of Linz which belongs to the state Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it qu@@ eries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ee has opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre .
she actually wanted to get his dog to Jutta wide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to put up the 49 year old owners of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ber market arcade , which eventually get some growth in the form of another business location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they sold bags , bags , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , revol@@ ves around the hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it had been rebuilt several weeks earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a long time , I missed that I am going to open a shop , &quot; says wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive factors for the decision was also the Fur@@ la producer , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a private location where only their hand@@ bags were sold , being done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only in the grandfather of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has wide received from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best , even if something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so , some woman in view of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can not answer the woman with the last security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe it &apos;s about that a nice bag is val@@ ed up every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place where residents of residents were called .
this feature also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he expressed himself a stranger , journalists is concerned or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office har@@ assed the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ a@@ ian k@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents originate from the real estate million .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ eats is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the vine .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned off a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by her c@@ stad@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has turned out a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts , among which beside Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz has counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes into the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also according to the saying that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is respect for the performance of the family , but also , the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit &apos; mouth &apos; , says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dently affir@@ ma@@ tions the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - at High German : the geber , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the investor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and the USA opened a seat to gold mines in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foundations of real estate agents were the first papers in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to the homeland and failed on the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate then belonged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not take tr@@ ump , because he once did without permission , the director of the Institute for Th@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared to film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ ump was the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the descendants of the descendants .
they had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a border wall in order to put illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as the pol@@ lin@@ ter , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remo@@ ver Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wind farm re@@ tire the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ate from the Americans . &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
do he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that &quot; the 72 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ capit@@ alists mention that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family came from a visit to the church level which was generally well arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t den@@ ounce the election because &quot; it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had for the time of his grandfather in the US had been , it would have been like he , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him . &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ end@@ els movie , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for long , have seen 12 000 stor@@ k@@ än@@ ger , even in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian church of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the hand of the Vice President in the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ er@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing . &quot;
in the neighboring country an alpine club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; is allowed to have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one @-@ fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the experiments of nine , taking the loss of leadership in the Today show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in the reviews for Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turn@@ ites put the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with present@@ ers David Cook and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , joined in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts that belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ agara Falls , Cancun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV @-@ viewers , because Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at five major cities , versus CHF 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Today Today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed the gap over the past few months .
in August Today added an average of 3@@ 18@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 out of Sun@@ rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40.000 and 50,000 went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in September Sun@@ rise stands on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .
the winds of change affect those hours more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine . thank you for review !

the great new difficulty for Seven was the impressive Carnegie Hall of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of the Raf@@ ina Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama on a recently swe@@ ating father , who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics have wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could bear a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ina Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from yesterday evening answered with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X Fac@@ tor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and easily spread The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8,000 ) and TB@@ L family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results at night two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( from 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz show . by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e found an average 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( from 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) , jump@@ ed on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators -@@ enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ia Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drop in the po@@ ds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ se@@ at ultimately takes place at 17 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar , which did not abol@@ ish the Mc@@ Gu@@ ia show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three matches , Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
revealed secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows - Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may be apparently in@@ ignor@@ ant to whoever wins The Bachelor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , when Sam Wood has ended in the Bachelor &apos;s bach@@ elor party , has been wrapped in greatest confidenti@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up , whether she is the one who received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally put an indication of who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam Wood has re@@ sealed its lips until the finals on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left out in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , If not you , who was the F@@ oods ? &quot; they could become their answers to the cor@@ rup@@ ters who won the heart of the brook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except herself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment on when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and SA@@ MS Energi@@ es , I felt that they were rather compatible , and I thought it was the overall course of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing at both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be along with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are good as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the previous week was her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now reserved for him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when asked what Wood should choose which Wood should choose , if not , it was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the left naked girls - it &apos;s a draw between s@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor is on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the U.S. , and there were many other teams sent after his impressive training day at the end of last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some trainers have banned from the rest of the game on the bank as he lost one of Ger@@ sh@@ in , as it did in his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula was familiar to his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies to gr@@ ind the team through the mill . he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference according to the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ s@@ cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who encouraged him to remember his embar@@ rass@@ ed catch and take care of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched by a P@@ unt who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Public Performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian pesti@@ l@@ ity had hopes for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and finally told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was such a thing that occurs now , people only care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , said Hay@@ nes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne engaged the car@@ ver with his debut in 2007 in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
but overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was conf@@ is@@ cated by his oil companies and entertaining his democratic efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the high number of refugees , the Free voters want a number of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ fall officers , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at the beginning of a severe crisis in Bavaria : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers participating in schools before collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get block@@ ages in the Bavarian image system . &quot;
the daily elec@@ torate of Free Elec@@ t@@ elec@@ tor runs until Friday in the middle of the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
other main topics were actually fore@@ seen .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Syrian National Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as they gave it during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it does not go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Syrian Army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the Free Syrian voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the directors , which are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W @-@ boss cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states are not being consistent : &quot; we need to use nationwide un@@ common standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bayern breaks away from others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to be more powerful . &quot;
but the country &apos;s state policy should not fall under the table under the table .
for years of long combustion the agenda is on the agenda .
the new school year of education Ludwig Spa@@ ak ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial of &quot; mid @-@ stage plus &quot; in which an extension of the gym@@ na@@ si@@ cal center stage of three to four years is started - in the result it lasts for nine years until the gradu@@ ation .
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic &quot; G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we call for freedom of choice for all schools that want .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a long stretching and nervous system , the German stock market has closed un@@ ner@@ ved and nervous ex@@ pe@@ ditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the afternoon a good start to the U.S. stock market for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the Dow Jones index spread all about 1 percent in the plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets are expected to make sure the markets remain in place in the United States , as well as for the big decline in the upcoming dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion around the cargo from the nuclear phase followed the stocks of RW@@ E , meanwhile , and left its mark deep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; mirrors &quot; the German energy companies potentially affect 30 billion euros .
the federal government issued the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the two largest German energy concepts were fully recovered , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.8 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the Da@@ x tip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the American investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took part in the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , investments in se@@ al@@ ant waf@@ er technologies and focus should be paid on the car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were dropped than in the same period last year as the industry association AC@@ EA has been leaving at the launch of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers of the Automotive , Daimler and BMW , increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people were killed after police squ@@ ir@@ rel on prot@@ esters in Nepal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal when the police used to demonstrate the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , approximately 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ nu P@@ ras@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief District Officer said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were assembled outside a police station , some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police used T@@ rän@@ k@@ as and pushed into the air before she returned to rubber bul@@ let . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ let , known from those that can be killed , but they are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently a high death rate produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contro@@ vers@@ y was the last in weeks violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese , where members of the ethnic group of Madrid declared that new provinces that would reduce their political influence within the framework of the proposed new constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were protests in western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want to build their own country .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers he became violent clas@@ hes since the 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , the country divided into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal has been re@@ igns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
building area in the city planned
the property at the Em@@ der Youth Centre ( Post Office ) is to be built again .
the city currently prepares everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is a mixture of trade , trade and living - but concrete offers are not available yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ den - The town Em@@ den is aim@@ ing to market some 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. in direct proximity to the youth center Old Post .
there are currently the preparations for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; planned is to use the premises for a mixture of trade , trade and housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
waiting for appropriate offers is to be made by the city .
which investor may come from it is not clear yet .
no agreements have been signed accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the plot which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Large Street , already just several months ago and that it can be heated to that building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning of the holiday Cottage at the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project .
several Ab@@ li@@ eger are still troubled - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure retreat
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months was behind closed doors , sp@@ elled , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for a new holiday resort are now close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interests , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company , presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee in the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , Ralf Behr@@ inger went into the offensive : &quot; we did not answer all questions yet , &quot; he said before the Members of the Council and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project &apos;s total of about ten to twelve million Euros has been in the discussion for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hef@@ ty reaction among marine owners who came in the session , called the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member representatives of the vic@@ tors of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ter that over@@ looks all the other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also feared how many other project critics said that the traffic by the intended size of the plant would greatly increase : &quot; so , all bus@@ h@@ ings must come , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly takes place on the good one hectare site of the former inn , is however still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first we have to understand a conclu@@ sive concept as &quot; Ralf Behr@@ inger said . &quot;
because this was still missing and the development plans were still variable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another clearly defined deep pressure system in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the small An@@ til@@ les also has a 60 percent potential , in the next two days a tropical cycl@@ one added to the weather experts in Miami . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google launches dou@@ bling @-@ raising campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ to @-@ donations campaign that will help thousands of refugees who have covered the European nations , since they will flee from war torn down countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach in announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google assistant who had fled to her family from Kabul at her family , while she had seven years old to have her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our trip many dark railway and bus@@ h@@ ings , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , included them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people look desper@@ ate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : physi@@ cians without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / ce@@ er@@ el@@ , to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were also prot@@ esting from the war broke off Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for slightly over@@ overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful to weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still too early to say , whether slightly overweight people live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; die mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote a new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery use various methods to minimize the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit their own ability to take food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity has proved to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been performed by people who are path@@ y fat with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BMI , a certain measure of weight compared to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng general hospital data used to have collected them in a study and compared with two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acids , which were slightly overweight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BMI of which was subjected to this operation , sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BMI with those who did not get @-@ surgical treatments received approximately the same amount as 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who undergo surgery were subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease triggered a total of 28 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , Diabetes was dissolved in only one percent in comparison with only approximately two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were evaluated with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general , in the &apos; surgical &quot; group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also imp@@ acted the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent by writing the researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also requires average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had more weight lost ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.1 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study has no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of severe people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , college of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was by obes@@ e people who subjected to obesity , about 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried un@@ conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone told us that it is soothing for people with a BMI less than 35 that are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , with no increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long , until we take people seriously , &quot; said she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , suffering from obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an issue that more frequently appears in Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tik : a young woman , to school times un@@ popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets her youth again after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so even in the newly published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be particularly interesting for H@@ uns@@ ro@@ cker &apos;s readers , for he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders requested to stop violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford . he is devoted to Eth@@ ics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the circumstances he urged the interests of humanity to defend the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries was ad@@ mira@@ ble despite refugee crisis , but the situation is not reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to lob@@ b@@ ying the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we have to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never loos@@ ened this problem . &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this has caused un@@ expect@@ edly consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant infection by children in the past 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gi@@ ft@@ control centers in the US reports an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swallow a strong alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ant , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ect@@ ants rose from children under 12 years , the tox@@ in control centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more frequently to those products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children may drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do it to impress their friends or susp@@ ect their friends for social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
show videos on YouTube such as you@@ ths of disinf@@ ect@@ ant just for a cheap experience .
teenagers said to have been used disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic cold water to obtain a harder drink .
younger kids can be angel@@ ic by attractive flav@@ ours of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( Hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , wine grapes and orange scent that are very promising for children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
many splash can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially with small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison @-@ call centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip of whis@@ ky as whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come to it , it is a fast way to consume plenty of alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , six year old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yers from the disinf@@ ect@@ ant of disinf@@ ect@@ ant . was taken into a not@@ ch for treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of an adult who is legally treated with a adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her in G@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ utes their words , and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doctors supervised they overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma when the girl dropped by the alcohol and pushed the head down and he said goodbye .
&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Or@@ ts Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers using non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ant within the reach of the child .
over alcohol pois@@ oning further disinf@@ ect@@ ant were associated with deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after swal@@ lowing disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associates submitted by health authorities dis@@ cour@@ aged that the product was contained in meth@@ anol , rather a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth class in the State of New York were pois@@ oning their lab@@ ors by taking anti@@ bacterial products around the teaching room , so it announces a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ant and f@@ aded them out of their space .
the police regarded the rejected plan as &quot; Knowledge Books &quot; and proof@@ ed to disciplinary action to the school authority .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors of dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which were spontane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . they were not under increased control because they are preparing for confron@@ tation with the Dutch table guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of championship competition in Scottish football - D@@ ut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of excitement among Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will spin things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
RON@@ NY D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic people must fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ ware to turn out things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now clearly followed a five point lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Celtic had already a bad time before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry and sad about what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we feel that exactly so - but we have to go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need to support Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
getting together is very important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January transfer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , the boss boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful with the signing of new@@ com@@ ers and insist@@ ed that he does not want to b@@ other the unity of the bro@@ my@@ x ca@@ sters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who come in the summer , have this pre@@ season time to integrate themselves what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team really is good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players ready to add what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while they are growing in the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July , during the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the UK@@ s of 5.@@ 9 percent , Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent , showing the numbers of the Bureau of National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision , to stay a part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have seen more improvements on the Scottish job market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I witnessed an execution in Ok@@ la@@ homa
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later , except for a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will be sitting in a gallery of gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ homa State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation took place already in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the day returns , I began to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to watch exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mak@@ eup lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ homa has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
who is selected is going to watch it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will sit down to Richard Glos@@ a , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ homa accused me on Twitter to give my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of a prisoner , as he wants and you will get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cleared them that they could have formulated better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they still think it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international repor@@ ter is present to write there .
when he dies in he thinks he is going to help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware is a repor@@ ter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post office next to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his actions , after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , would make him guilty of his benef@@ ici@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to jus@@ tify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution was wrong .
and from this perspective I will surely die .
I can not claim to be real objective .
there will be other leaders in which you can apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after mo@@ ist police hunt is persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ cies remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt of a man from Perth , the police being un@@ successful , was un@@ successful when he was a police officer , only a few meters away from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to go back to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a household frac@@ ture incident in Por@@ ken@@ ham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t get out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unstable farm Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform wet , so he turned on a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun things to escape . &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
hunting soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , Cou@@ sins drove his car in the ditch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but insp@@ ira@@ tional insights into the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins Bi@@ athlon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy said that Ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ying him , and threatened to finish racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy said that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria began to install a spy in his st@@ ables , threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was aim@@ ing for ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him using the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment that last straw was carried out on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what &apos;s best for racing and he himself has found himself under difficult conditions so it could not explain the positive cob@@ alt specimen of Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had traveled for 18 months because of the ion@@ age charges and didn &apos;t want to see it &quot; as being too high grapes &quot; grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had before , nothing to say about it , and I have spent long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there is far reaching .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes one respon@@ ds , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live thereby what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to walk up@@ raised major people , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start to think , I do not do it , then I should not be more trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that Moo@@ dy had allowed the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integ@@ rity department had strug@@ gled to t@@ ying his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I am going to be able to deliver information about what I said within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I &apos;m a che@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is the case , they certainly should touch their n@@ oses because they have failed to touch me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , CEO of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , led to time and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should this make me think that it is personal ?
did the RV@@ L behave correctly and might be responsible for people outside of trainees as well what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
is I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps they have to take my license and pushed me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve arrived at that point now , where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and press them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , the fruit levels of the trainer had built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt investigation with Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching advised that he could throw off his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of the un@@ discovered master &apos;s Black Ca@@ viar ; described the racing therapy rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after having been applied to a pack of mud or sound on the equ@@ est@@ rian rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers has deceived Sch@@ lamm on the leg .
it could have been that night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , it could have been the whole day so that it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also had such a race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . a study of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who set these rules , do not know about the horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one went too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after drivers cursed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist , followed wor@@ ships in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rider was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries due to being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that drivers continued to stop , without stopping , in order to help the injured driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia of the police set in Sh@@ ep@@ han@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats war on ri@@ vals for ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have the CM @-@ players &quot; Ring competitions , with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample tune &quot; of the ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two from Queens@@ land won &apos;t be too good in the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that she could only concentrate on her &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ kling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team are confident , because it pleased that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that di@@ ps up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ fights , as she sm@@ iled us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive System or the techniques all year . but in the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles for a real focus , and that has done for us the trend revers@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to practice . he is therefore probably not used to lose , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s funny as this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or to remember that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bored &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team who can play and watch this as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of gam@@ bl@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so as they can play them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build more trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the Big Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster equ@@ alled a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the bronze was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or are breaks and there are no points to be ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you mention us , it means we will meet in one phase or more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team did free on this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the advance in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ deposit to drug use
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong sentence threatened due to his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine that came after Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic ( 29 ) was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police came 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay and reached in August in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed like he met his co @-@ accused in the yacht harbour in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite an possibly lifel@@ ong sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , he ar@@ gued that he could have been no evidence that he tried to have the whole lot and that it could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice of Peter Flan@@ agan was worried about the danger of danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia and he explained to the court on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a criminal trial , he lied to the police with his place of stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to make his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the read out of the two people it is clear that the issu@@ ance of a 200,000 dollar security is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to stop him , not to appear , warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on ba@@ il , under the conditions that he passes his Australian and his Serbian passport , police reports on a daily basis and a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident on A5 in Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab remains falling apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a car accident involving three trucks on free@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the three participating trucks had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent place in the direction of Basel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver had noticed too late and tried in vain , to devi@@ ate from the last moment to the left , like the Police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab is completely falling apart .
the driver has been seriously injured to a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed , through six hours to 2 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a damages amounting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ enti@@ ve ma@@ ids to send pictures
a girl @-@ hel@@ per used the phone of a 11 year old girl to challenge pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when I was asleep . in an online mess@@ aging service he used to login to a series of in@@ permanent pictures of children received him from another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the sle@@ epy case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she looked through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately their mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police cleared themselves and saw the five images , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered the &quot; web @-@ research &quot; used in search of in@@ accessible pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to be a polic@@ eman in the internet , because it would lead to &quot; p@@ eg@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ile &quot; in the internet . &quot; and he then , there was a polic@@ eman to make her afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a diction to make people scar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to make P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that he did so to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he is sick in his head when he drinks , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the telephone , she called her mother and was with the cit@@ tern and we@@ eping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then looked at the in@@ consistent pictures on the phone and confron@@ ted the def@@ endants with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls , who looked much younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded not guilty to the charges of the indictment , un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June this year and not appeared before the court hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the defence lawyer , Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g could not appear in the Register of sexual crimes , as it could be ar@@ gued that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element in his going . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ sta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael refused to receive background reports until October in order to preserve background reports on social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g was given a ba@@ il , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was still recorded before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual crimes .
locks on small level crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up in the German @-@ Austrian border away from the major control points .
many locks from fear of discovery and arrest of people increased by smaller border crossing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the federal police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the border crossing of Inn , Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been inter@@ ven@@ ed for more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were on foot about bridges and dust on the German side .
from there they are used by federal polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Munich Central Station , a clear more refugees , met with national police information compared to the weekend started on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 700 people have arrived in the capital alone until 8.00 , and he said a speaker in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the introduction of insp@@ ections on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ erunner of the &quot; Henry &quot; in the South West
meteor@@ ologists war@@ n against tor@@ mb@@ o@@ sts in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low pressure area above Western Europe we currently have hot marine air in the country and in Stuttgart the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vig@@ orous manner is the for@@ erunner of the &quot; Henry &quot; , who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thunder@@ storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest , on the Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District continued to count from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sun is also visible on Friday .
the masses makes it : every two years the high@@ s show their new products at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the movement of the compact car has to be considered particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28,@@ 1 percent of the new appro@@ vals fell from the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Pub@@ lication date from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , new cars will be presented above all this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is Opel Astra , which will be available at the dealers in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Dr. Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the volume model is also sold as well , the new Astra should also not become more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Opel launched a start @-@ up of the largest competition VW Golf in the prosp@@ ect of up to € 17 million .
the current Astra is starting from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a output of 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Hes@@ sia offer another diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially just one fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what will be even next to the Astra at the IAA .
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its premium @-@ competition in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively depicted in a conventional and an empha@@ sized sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the trade it comes at the beginning of next year as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan particles wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully compatible with its curved lines in the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that will celebrate its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo generator and a output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 compact class model that is available at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ se@@ ep laid hands on the front side : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ painted and the head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced through a touch screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play is integrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the IAA in the compact class , the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I was added to the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ deta@@ in@@ ce to the judicial centre of judicial authorities that lived for months in a small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of injury her human dignity , prisoners have fundamentally claim to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the person affected may even hope for money , if they were imprisoned for only a few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an ex @-@ prisoner with its constitu@@ tion@@ ist in Karlsruhe . he was in a single cell with around five square meters floor area between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not seper@@ ated separately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this , the man who was immediately looking back to a large prison cell was moved to a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his term of detention had failed due to the un@@ worthy warrant of arrest against the Land Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Chamber of the Chamber of Berlin and rejected the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the human dignity hurt .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the period of legal reasons could be decisive for the compensation of only a few days , be a compensation , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise &quot; it would be a worry of the personality of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clari@@ fy the amount of money .
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they first spoke in April to a prisoner of pol@@ ishing , because he was locked in a prison cell in a prison cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human un@@ worthy , a decision of 2011 is also according to a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed a decent accommodation on Wednesday in a parallel accident in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ lä@@ ger was lived for three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin Pr@@ ison has come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to temples , should it be possible because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Justice press office 21 places in Te@@ gel due to young offspring is not occupied ; 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge , the ch@@ anc@@ ellor has decided to adopt it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in Germany this year , according to testimony of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge and again : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we &apos;ll do so . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after different forecasts are needed between 350@@ 000 ( esti@@ mation of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ 000 ( esti@@ mation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , and the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space , however , is particularly adv@@ anta@@ geous : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are out of the rental price and will apply for these particularly cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have had to emer@@ ge and this would have to invest a funding amount of 6.4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , scientists and Federal Minister for Hou@@ sing Council agree that there must also be more tax advantages for residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 per cent of the poultry can be employed in Germany in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Germany the refugees in Germany were not consul@@ ted with their qualifications as Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is essential to find them in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for este@@ em in the sponsor@@ ship Society , but also for the este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ rant researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ab@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ k@@ hardt , a political turning point was given : from the ban of work for refugees to recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while it was a banned ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , and the asylum seek@@ ers have been limited to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of the occupation of the labour market - mostly the view is forced to allow refugees rapid access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also showed that work@@ places are most common through personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore to view from th@@ rot@@ hardt the royal road to work integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few poultry parents give their children to day@@ care centres , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ root parents , it is only important to keep the family together in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to convince the family still of the benefits of kit@@ a , the administration booklet in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education by providing more specialized schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students without knowledge of knowledge will be prepared in the classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have an qualification in German as second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no lack of them says Be@@ ate St@@ ages from the Berlin School of school .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no Federal asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the British sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has given up his post@@ ure now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies on studies might be reli@@ eved from access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ ce receive no services after the asylum seek@@ ers more , if they start a study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter has fundamentally won &apos;t be BA@@ fö@@ G that they cannot fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , Ged@@ ul@@ fed refugees had to live four years in Germany to be able to make BA@@ fö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this division was shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this funding gap must also be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ fö@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims ; and for many is religion important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should acc@@ use Islam in the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association would be important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the Rights also belong to the Rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representative of Islam must be on a clear contact with the state and to cooperate with the state in many areas to give him some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the read@@ iness to he@@ ats home against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ cy@@ ek , expressed concern that religious conflicts may also be brought into account as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to educ@@ ate such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to be appearing in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to become a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the majority society will have to change the breakdown of discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - a short@@ wave of anti @-@ discrimination and General Con@@ struc@@ tional Act of a decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NSU Trial series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same chances for all : what Mig@@ rant @-@ organizations and stakeholders have long been committed to Germany for the next few years , if the country should remain peaceful and should use its new citizens - for the good of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany could be able to supply medi@@ cally the previously expected refugees , with Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however additional money must first flow into the system .
to avoid Eng@@ b@@ asses , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all of the resi@@ sts right after registration health cards .
these services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term this is highly question@@ able so many people have to travel to the limited performance catalogue which provide the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise the doctors especially make the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as before , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse over their disease than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics or medical practices can also be taken on interpre@@ ting costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , many refugees too would have helped with more general an@@ ci@@ ents in emergency out@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under refugee deposits , there are about to give much more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the youth I go to HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partial movement of disease in German physi@@ cians from their apprentic@@ eship , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite or tuberculosis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and what the nu@@ is@@ cence in sight is possibly even reli@@ eving in the refugees .
Syrians have developed a highly developed image system ; several refugees are even doctors .
to be able to practise their qualification but would need to dis@@ close their qualifications again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is ill @-@ ill after the Bund@@ esp@@ ec@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress of stress or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children who are especially viol@@ ently explains Hans Mun@@ z and President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU Munich published that every fifth Syrian refugee tragedy is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory emergency , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart disease and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems ; strong terror and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent the symptoms are chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , decl@@ aring Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however up to date only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit a request for psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , in the social hunters or doctors , who are not trained in psychological conditions , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this often lead to mis@@ calculations ; says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , wildlife dres@@ sage and its single entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in Man@@ ege invites to relax on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Tier@@ instruc@@ tors and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto for the current man@@ oeu@@ vre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift to inspire is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take people from their all day and take it to another world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year junior level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flavour &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst is his concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities during the barely 3 000 km long tour , this fla@@ ir can now experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

ab@@ ins@@ ing in the post@@ ure of cir@@ cus are only very often topic of various animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes his position on this occasion , &quot; Is it not good for our animals , nor does it go well ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every p@@ etting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , as they are lovingly called , is read after the possibility of each desire of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal does not feel good and doesn &apos;t want to bring it into the arena .
so the upper@@ most commandment is : good for the animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on their Zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two animals lived together in an en@@ closures and nothing happened .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly via the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also troubled by claims of opposition from the opposition , that they had been warned of anonymous death threats and had warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month they had spread him , and interrupted him as a position of the nation in Parliament , this is the word that he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for the democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politi@@ cian SMS messages have received upon her mobile phones , who warned them to b@@ other Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that does not appear but she has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ c@@ it &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity termin@@ ates in the parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man said that written by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried about the dangers of the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard sets up to 30,000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard will cost 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP will split later into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business of his fast growing company hardware and service activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected deficit reduction lead to an amount of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive Officer , which should lead the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is being smaller and stronger than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ en portfolio of businesses , which support companies with the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual and will be concent@@ rating , integrated technology solutions for companies so far , &quot; such a declaration of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to convert electrical systems to the Palo Alto garage and the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to tackle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies offer better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates will have to stand before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger was over against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation after plan goes , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario is already thinking that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then found back to his old swing during the pre@@ season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the car@@ eers &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that does not toler@@ ate well .
it is not a major affair .
that was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in touch with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries which he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true of pure medical perspective , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of other injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops a unpleasant pattern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ ko Ltd has 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he played in just 65 from arsen@@ als of arsen@@ als and 157 league players in the past five times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the larger picture for Arsenal is that , in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have list most of their vulner@@ abilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil sin@@ ister , but arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the vulner@@ ability during the last season will last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a consp@@ ic@@ uous time period of time to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go a career of the kind , which he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Saturday and against tot@@ e ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and W@@ enger presents a rotation within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia and what means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must be started .
W@@ enger is also starting with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to have a little car@@ ving break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are passed through Group F to pass through the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest auto focus effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ sealed &quot; campaign launched during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , the stadium was shaken by an earthquake , where on the Richter scale 3.2 were measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the teaching of last season with the Champions League &apos;s surrender to Monaco , and remains committed by far hope , with his management the association will lead to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship festival : the com@@ edy @-@ Show that grants us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident , particularly with regard to the need for men to open himself , now more desper@@ ate than ever before , such as suicide attacks on a 15 @-@ year high performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aign against Living Show@@ ers ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a very bad life ) began to issue the men in question , who prevented the men from doing so when they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms found that when the body had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for those who are not de@@ press@@ ant are a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends in order to work together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Age of social media , with its main focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , vital and successful , even if the isolation is dominated by reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the dominant values such as psych@@ ologists ec@@ in@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared that money can really not buy .
the Schön@@ s in Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every character was not defined by his personality , but through his personality , caused by the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football sta@@ ins in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross . all this came out of the knowledge that men can confi@@ dently stay , even if they often reject their feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the telephone pastor@@ al care , I told me : ... &quot; my audience role for people who are depres@@ sive and su@@ ici@@ ate , made me a difference how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men who contact us often feel not able to speak with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ase &quot; I come right now &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term ma@@ el@@ ism mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she presents clearly the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
so my objective out@@ sider status is about the phone the person in moments of des@@ pair also able to help her long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely new setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , even better if you can sit alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know which difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help Malm@@ ö in gr@@ ind
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits vs Malm@@ ö .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his debut in the Champions League , Tuesday and PS@@ G helps to pass on Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept surfing course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain kept his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the champ@@ ions of his Champions League de@@ pressing as PS@@ G players , who set up a number of opportunities before they finally missed their advantage , when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the A group , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish masters , but an improvement on the way to the quarters in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ ame of Laurent Blan@@ cs team faced with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics in front of the gate . he later began his long career in the game with whom he long started his long career in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to get back and rela@@ unch our opponents in the course of season , even if there are certain things we need to do during the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it we weren &apos;t yet another or two more gates have achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his injury on one of three changes into the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic was going to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ opted for Bordeaux in the first league , but he was spread in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing stor@@ my was described as the man , the PS@@ G was taken over to the next level in Europe when he ran at Johan Wil@@ and in his last month before he joined Johan Wil@@ and in his long corner of the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , situated in a Play @-@ off at An@@ pi@@ ff , joined the field with nine members of the field and became a five @-@ man defense and two deeply rooted in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic which was widely passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s stal@@ lions in the 3@@ 4th minute we offered little in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes given up , with some patches with fla@@ ws and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who was abandoned in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after the restart of Cav@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill if he had turned his fellow players into the game and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who was kno@@ cked into a shooting down von Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute passing the p@@ fo@@ s ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second door finally fell short after the hours of Cav@@ ani , thanks to Cav@@ ani . after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had reached a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it finished all the thought that Malm@@ ö got back to the game and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ de from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result before substitute for Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age of Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we only played in the Swedish League who did not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hut off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE colle@@ cts 2.5 billion $ by share purchases
the mining @-@ giant G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE in Switzerland based in Switzerland is dam@@ aging to commodity prices and collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of his huge debt identity plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE registered in London said in a statement that it sold a £ 1.6 billion worth of shares to pay its own debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling prices thanks to China &apos;s economic down@@ turn and demands devastating on markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early Wednesday morning , the output of the privileged right brought a rapid rise to the top of London stock exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE had announced the 2.5 billion $ stock ticket as part of the most comprehensive plans to be redeemed about a third of his 30 billion debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new hol@@ dings of 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 per cent of the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have decreased about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices by 20 to 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ i Jin@@ ping Chinese president will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , the White House confirmed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and re@@ vo@@ red president Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing in the past November , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host to X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at this evening , after the two leaders have bilateral discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; president &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to extend American Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also President Obama and President X@@ i add the opportunity to create areas of differences in a constructive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology guides on its way to Washington before joining New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Obama and X@@ i have a series of rig@@ orous questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns relating to alleged Cyber@@ sp@@ ying China and its growing self @-@ awareness in controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern was obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion league champion , two times European champion , two times European champion , one time world champion of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona and moved to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now says he was standing before the F@@ arewell in Barcelona before the F@@ EM 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça will sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything we didn &apos;t tell . &quot;
and this is also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ my wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
the change did not come about .
and the decisive factor for this is now working for the German record champion : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explained why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has captured Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP has told me that I wouldn &apos;t change , that he could not have imag@@ ined the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so he has given me a critical condition . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ pay@@ play began in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi stood for bar@@ ca in the fourth round of the Champions League against the entire distance on the lawn , cut the red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end of the King &apos;s triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the documentary film@@ makers Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said , they don &apos;t need behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a succession by Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown took place when this is the need for alternative prospects and in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about variety , then do it in the filling of the movie and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted strongly with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor had captiv@@ ated by The Mar@@ tian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production unit Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck , and the tro@@ ut brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will also always be the director , how she will treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she &apos;s a nut@@ ty that is beaten by her white Pottok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Produc@@ er Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio is for direc@@ ting rights at the film ; Dam@@ on said that her director , at the end could be something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was released and the social media explo@@ ded against dam@@ oun@@ cement over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ et expressed his anger over the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in space , so he can declare their diversity - this is SO KNOW that it is hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 5,000 retin@@ ets and 4.000 songs were used since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s comments are coming to a point at the point of the conference in the media , at the point of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 through a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black lives of Mat@@ ter nationwide , and the government , discri@@ min@@ ated practices against farming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the launch of the annual albums of the year with Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s still matte &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums are still their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more recently , leaders of the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation as respon@@ ding to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as an hatred group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group &quot; &quot; said the leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he has accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope , it is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; scrat@@ ched first champion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional sport climb@@ s and guidance for Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ lete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never seen a competition participant who managed to close all the steps of his obstacle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the final season there were two men from Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten until the finals .
the rock climbing for the last task was one 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ritten completed the task within the period when he was the first Ath@@ lete , who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 from American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock above the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10.000 $ or to live , Isaac E said ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent WE@@ ED started discussing the finals with The Hollywood repor@@ ter in order to discuss the finals and why did he finish the course at all , not any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rules goes to the quick@@ est person according to the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is more than a fin@@ alists , there is the one with the quick@@ est time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ ED . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful value and life changed , he gets the great gra@@ ti@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do not believe that he h@@ opped this a res@@ ent@@ ment .
he is just so happy to have what he has done .
he received millions of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think that Isaac had felt at the same time , if they had de@@ af roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers gr@@ ats on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ CH@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger stands on the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers reduced their role as spo@@ iler , but did this part play perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins at 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins had a chance for asc@@ ending within one side of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , even though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F words , which was so difficult to hold over a big part of the season &apos;s second half of season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; tiger manager Brad looks like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , finishing in the first two inland again next three times in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck him for 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and made three ranks .
it was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the Bull@@ pen every game and so I want to concentrate completely into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two ranks for his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ game of Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against Seattle on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has swe@@ eping the battles of the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) looked much better from the bull@@ pen and he put it straight into the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three R@@ uns in the rear end of the seventh inward , T@@ wins had her best chance to come back to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ ders Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double along the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Right of Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon gave his second bas@@ e@@ eman Brian sum@@ ans to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the bla@@ ster Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Har@@ dy passed the wall the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted by the designed R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano called the Re@@ chtsh@@ et Dre@@ w Ver@@ ha@@ ges a two @-@ run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the final Run on the second one , Ver@@ hagen brought Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Major League leading 27th time in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth place in August , the wall came to an expert against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the right to be present in three pitch for his fifth saves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit presented to the start of the game from a non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which had been das@@ hed in front of the game by the injury list , after he had missed more than a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished me , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ early gave a single with Second Bas@@ eman Ian She@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought to the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Martin@@ ez managed to win his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right hand side , with a more run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was kic@@ king out of the game , when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger killed in the second , a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of the Center Field of Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow &quot; &quot; T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has not sm@@ iled particularly well , but he took the right spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a pitch @-@ count and scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the re@@ semb@@ ling Re@@ chtsh@@ chman A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Hu@@ gh@@ es , three hits came with four hits and one walk with four strips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hundreds of refugees to stay in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people in Wiesbaden should then be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden announced on the Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it anticip@@ ates 450 to 750 upcoming refugees from 450 to 750 people .
several sports halls of the domestic capit@@ ol have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can stop temporarily .
they should then be transferred to other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the ruling leaders of G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people were taken up in Hessen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have set up emergency shel@@ ters for large numbers of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ es because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think that the subsequent thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany . &quot; he said .
he threw the European states &quot; collective departure . &quot;
four years ago we had been glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed by .
&quot; now the conflict arises out on our door@@ step . &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced control to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Federal Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained to the Austrian television channel on Tuesday evening , and now no one is sent back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor Germany was sent away for refugees to Austria .
&quot; no &quot; it is so agreed . &quot; she explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to issue a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , who had already given a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , had given it lawful meetings between the General Director for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete figures she did not call them and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan Route , from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their target is mostly in Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied on jointly with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet to agree on a joint approach in the crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers will take a new start for another 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries for the first up@@ take and distribution of men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with the Federal Chanc@@ ellery , the Federal Chancellor , agreed to close cooperation with the Prime Minister in Berlin on the late Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need shelter , be@@ ards it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not wish any lead @-@ up could not stay in Germany either .
this view was expressed in the turn in the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole are now needed to master a &quot; gigantic force effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck in the Balkan Route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the night , Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours he announced the government in Budapest , also crossing the border with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to stop tu@@ g@@ boat emig@@ rated over Romania to Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants are reported to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this diving movement is only small but still too large for a solid orb program , called it in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an examination resulted in a violation of Ad@@ du@@ lation ( 27 @-@ year @-@ old ) .
Rama had lam@@ ented for pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich the diagnosis is &quot; probably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this makes us difficult , Rama is a her@@ ing loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we must re@@ think , &quot; said Sport@@ director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of an in@@ less professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet @-@ fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ go are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to pay attention on his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged from them .
because man@@ go contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy are the exotic fruits , nevertheless : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. were mostly contain man@@ go , but much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who eats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing Mang@@ os should not be too soft or tend to smell pleasantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour @-@ color alone says nothing about it , as ripe fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os can taste delicious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should store at room temperature and consumed within a few days .

the US par@@ cel service UPS is back up to 9@@ 5000 machines for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company started with recru@@ itment of seasonal workers from the beginning of the week .
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , UPS had extended its workforce by around 9@@ 5,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

first gro@@ aning tower - then distinctive cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night breaks out in the valleys of the alp@@ habet of the hair dryer , like met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and night , the Föhn blows with storm strength through the gro@@ aning valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the gro@@ aning on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold front crosses the vig@@ orous ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News is writing in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a wide grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong South West stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the mountain side of the Alps , the hair is set off by the valleys in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the Föhn blows up to Thursday in the gro@@ ov@@ y with ar@@ ches from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally also with over 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Föhn is able to reach adjacent to the adjacent center , and even mountains are possible even on the mountains of over 120 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang begins to st@@ ow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here rain is falling down until Thursday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , the south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned within 48 hours with partial over 100 litres of rain per square meter , this has already been huge rainfall in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning , hair dryer the air off , in the consequence un@@ covers a cold front with strong , partly funny rain from west to east through Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the cold front , the wind picks up strong until stor@@ my , and temperatures proceed clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days are in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , sunny and warmer at the weekend will be sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Rome , almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of the President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a well @-@ known place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German re@@ former . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing scheme was applied for the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Ponti@@ f@@ ical centuries were often only able to live in secret their faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the square , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith was welcome in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beha@@ ved as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the beginning of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 months in Rome .
he found the city back then a married sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions could have encouraged him to face hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the western Church with his thes@@ es against the las@@ h@@ pin .
awesome artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works made by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and read Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and fan@@ ciful positions has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means equal , with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective topics can be quite model@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his project , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many books of the &quot; Book of All Books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are cycles that revol@@ ve topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ern@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , he was fascinated by several partners : this applies to Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there , especially the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , based on the basis of painting with the respective Bible points has been dealt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the language selected by Ot@@ mar Old Bible , and thus translated today &quot; translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embedded in Martin Luther , a proposition of the artist , had formulated his own personal thoughts about the situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry cord has gold Let@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old creates a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt in 1940 was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin . it comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; the up@@ bringing was done by the pi@@ pel@@ ines that was at the end of Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ work that , perhaps to bear me back with the Lord father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern was to reflect the art in fast time again : &quot; the perception of imaging is now shaped by public@@ ity , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being har@@ assed .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
images always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; I am a din@@ osau@@ r in this respect . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to drop out into the pictures , &quot; dis@@ covering and feel what strength they have , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image looks for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was thrown on Tuesday during the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in which it has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he can gras@@ p life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t mind how to fully gras@@ p the Bible , but the most important , mysti@@ cal themes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text illustrated only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place was to be commissioned and model@@ ed the company for a round circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was already final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insurance policies in politics and administration of dr@@ ink@@ age , especially with residents , who did not toler@@ ate the railways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill off top of a new place - now with formal planning and application on building permission .
the first com@@ edy by Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to inform the approval of the child and youth committee in October .
&quot; I hope that this year was still visible . &quot; she said .
then it should be started without &quot; further break @-@ break &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment for refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga set a clear sign on weekends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is respon@@ ding to the excited situation in Germany , which secu@@ res his help in addressing the existing problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have been dealing with the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one in principle that no one can say to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should be interested in every individual , get this topic into the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet the Minister for the State of Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
that soccer can and desire to help .
but the crucial course is to introduce politics .
the German Football Federation is therefore expanding its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome to four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
on this weekend the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ et will set a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ cot tun@@ es instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) and we will help - &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that everyone will help , where and as they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ understand@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every thing and nobody may see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football ti@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our brilli@@ ance , our influence , and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already been doing so incredibly well , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Peter Sa@@ ys spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European qualification game against Hungary , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ see could have started its own projects in their places is magnificent .
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of great importance . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association ends together with DF@@ B selection , and the federal government will spend 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ver@@ eine have already cleared all the sum for 2015 as &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach reported .
reports : SAP executive committee loses one eye in accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports according to the down@@ fall of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after midnight , at the staircase of his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water@@ glass by midnight , according to the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was s@@ wo@@ oned , and then tow@@ ed out to the road - that told us so last week , &quot; he quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP founder and Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can leave his job .
&quot; beginning of October we are meeting at the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is working with the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday afternoon ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to contribute to the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP since I &apos;m full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to tell him to the public with such a personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : anyone can happen that something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stop once you &apos;re fallen . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thus comes in Singapore on the weekend as well as a refuge for the two family pilots Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ C without R@@ EU@@ s at Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Tor
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes were defin@@ ded definitely for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group game of Europe League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national player is also missing the table of the soccer league player in Du@@ el , with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel , Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the high load on its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change his regular eleven positions at the R@@ EU@@ s position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ en position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of regul@@ ating Roman novel Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the world champion &apos;s world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ chel is open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with high lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood he will also deny the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the formal statement of players R@@ EU@@ s , that the final approval for the Bv@@ B in the European League will be the goal of a celebration of medium @-@ field , Julian W@@ eig@@ l , &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to capture the title . &quot;
robot@@ ic cars : government plans leadership role for Germany
Germany shall be the leader in the change of the state of technological leader after the will of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) which sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ esse IAA , a &quot; new Mobility age &quot; Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will enhance the road safety and ensure less stress , he said , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , at the IAA also with representatives of the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strategy office of the transport service emphas@@ ises among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast @-@ level ascent on digital radio listening .
a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this to the driver &quot; no additional liability risks to be brus@@ hed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany is aim@@ ing to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to use himself for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far can only be seen as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when driving , automated driving takes over the car the leadership , the driver will be more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data during seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a study conducted by the Economic Ministry , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless non @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; value added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site , assess the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S @-@ D @-@ traffic policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability in accidents and the safety of personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical - a lot more than French or Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one on Wednesday at the AA commission of the FOR@@ SA Institute , on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA will assume that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will mean only at least 20 percent in the next ten years , 31 percent do not believe it at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents count by 2025 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on an independent car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a collection of the digital federation B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree , to give control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Autobahn , this could expect 15 percent in flowing traffic , rising 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a mixture of great fashion show and a wax figures , designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the highlights : display mannequ@@ ins that look ugly thanks to video projec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among others , was a stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and thus that he inserted men in skirts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the cent@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always easy , meanwhile , it &apos;s genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) that is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung at the beginning of the exhibition has changed his position to a show about his personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he actually was , because : &quot; for me a show was a bit &apos; after death , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies in it comes into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is going to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the more far @-@ looking work of the man who has written the fashion story without ever taking a training .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically the vision is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work that was done for the d@@ olls , for example , specifically a St@@ ylist has been engaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 tons of material have saved the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the October Festival , a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l was still a special leather outfit with a Kor@@ s@@ ett . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old t@@ eddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first sket@@ ches @-@ to@@ g@@ ages of the designer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to play a doll with his parents could not have allowed him .
the design of fashion he later taught himself .
he did fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers designed to Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them naturally .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything but could with@@ hold the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be about the long embroi@@ dery , in and around P@@ lau@@ en , about half meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips came into large quantities for customers , which they worked for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the mo@@ zz@@ iness P@@ lau@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion has played a major role , has been supp@@ ressed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds some examples : lace in jewelry and accessories such as bags and at regional costumes .
it is the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Mode that leans on the ver@@ le@@ po@@ che to have a growing customer potential .
those who are not used in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
they have already half of all orders with us .
Equ@@ est@@ rian P@@ lau@@ en is a member of nine other companies joined the industry association P@@ lau@@ en Sp@@ itz and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
about 80 per cent of its sales have been generated in the last 15 years .
private business and also wholesale are there almost no more .
our products hardly reach our products on this road .
the mass merchandise nowadays is much cheaper today in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
besides the addition of export available to Russia and the USA .
so many reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score environmental awareness like Cord@@ ula Bauer explains : &quot; this year , we have seen a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Flo@@ oring Academy Z@@ wick@@ au , he lectures at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to remedy the competition from the Asian region you have to find quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a voltage drop between the most fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and plants that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design often varies only slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago fashion designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ves the historic snow@@ fla@@ ws .
at some places the machine embroi@@ dered small kitchen .
the P@@ lau@@ er Gold@@ schmi@@ dt of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ts had inspired him : &quot; before that I could not begin with a traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot;
now they use the top tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ en - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also has to live in the USA , to Australia and to Finland , mainly customers whose ancestors want to live in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and wish to live a souvenir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not touch him , but Disney will still be dar@@ ing in a new film of his &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it does not work for a new movie , but about 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny &apos;s family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who tries to play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is un@@ clear .
but the director is already clear : Rob Marshall , the last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges that the economy is wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to be wider to the outside , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned to reform the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should use it to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th Meeting of Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms from new momentum and vig@@ our , and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Leadership Group has adopted a series of policies including a negative list to regulate the market access , including a negative number of border controls , promoting public capital ( SO@@ E ) , to promote private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population reporting system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the statement a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified that will not come into question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance , as it con@@ forms to the market a major role in allocation of resources , a constitutional business environment and makes the market more open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also provide controls on the power of transferred powers , and make sure that companies make their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statement said that China will allow the border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer , open @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will be opened for private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the lawful interests of foreign finance and better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by integrating the requirements and simpli@@ fy the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ko@@ qi@@ ang and important leader as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as were reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double its mercury limits in rob@@ ber@@ fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a proper working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects are inf@@ licted with pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Wolf schmi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolfgang schmi@@ dt ought to be raised the mar@@ ginal values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , from a to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large pre@@ dat@@ ors are therefore strongly stressed with mercury , that in the basis of the applicable limit values of around 50 per cent of the amount could not be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the limit of limit values would only be 14.@@ 5 percent after dou@@ bling the limit values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values of other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ood@@ watch used this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller grav@@ ey@@ ors are often so low to keep them up to date already today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the sin@@ king of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dence man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wolf schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is strongly enriched over the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the federal government war@@ ns that &quot; small amounts may cause damage to the nervous system &apos;s injuries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declar@@ es on its homepage with regard to current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury mainly transported from coal combustion to the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry on the Green Parliamentary Group , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock given more than six metric tons of mercury into Germany &apos;s total quantity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentrations of mercury in fish have been crossed in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube as well &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had quoted the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , European war@@ nings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
