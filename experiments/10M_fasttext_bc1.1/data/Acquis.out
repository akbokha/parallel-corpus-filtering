an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the Anti @-@ B blo@@ wers or a corresponding comparison of the B @-@ blood cells .
an Anti @-@ B Serum can be bl@@ ended on a sample bearer with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent rise of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same trial has dissolved by the Anti @-@ B blo@@ b group or with a standard pre@@ set of same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum is gained from the blood of selected persons of the group 0 that can be immune to the group A and group B immun@@ oph@@ ilia .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ized human red blood cells , the group A including sub @-@ groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB , including sub @-@ groups A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are ag@@ glut@@ amine nor human red blood cells that contain any ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ug@@ ly A or B , i.e. ones of group 0 .
ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ized human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated in general by anti @-@ A serum ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard power par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group or an equivalent comparison of blood cells , separated against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
in addition , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group or an equivalent comparison of B @-@ blood cells .
in no case the effectiveness of the service must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum has also become an easy @-@ known ag@@ glut@@ al@@ ination of blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum on a property slide with the same amounts of 5 to 10 percent of blood cells were mixed , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double time may occur , but the same trials must be dissolved by the Anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard pre@@ set of equal activity .
a Anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a sample bearer with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent rise of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same trial has dissolved by the Anti @-@ B blo@@ b group or a standard pre @-@ par@@ at of same Avi@@ dity .
a Anti @-@ A + A Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent of blood cells ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ al@@ ination will occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group camera each speci@@ fic@@ ity can belong to one of two types which are distinguished by the conditions of which ag@@ glut@@ al@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with others , known as &quot; in@@ completely &quot; it can only be achieved by ag@@ glut@@ ination only in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; S@@ era ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on object carriers even hom@@ ologist red blood cells that are sh@@ em@@ ulated in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of S@@ era to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard prepar@@ es are available ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group@@ ing ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is gained from the blood of one or several persons who are immune to immun@@ ity of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells which contain an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .
the complete Anti @-@ D S@@ era must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooking sal@@ ine solution .
a &quot; in@@ sufficient &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or an equivalent comparison to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum is to respond to blood cells that contain Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D S@@ era , who are destined for use of object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent rise of c@@ c@@ De@@ e @-@ blood cells at about 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ en@@ ue must be completely dissolved within 120 seconds .
an anti @-@ C serum is gained from blood one or more people who are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous C of the R@@ h system immune system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these S@@ era are therefore specifically specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are sh@@ em@@ ulated in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ re of the anti @-@ C S@@ era ( complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .

an anti @-@ E serum is gained from blood one or more people who are immune by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E S@@ era ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E S@@ era , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent rise of blood cells at about 40 ° C , and ag@@ glut@@ en@@ sic agents must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of speci@@ fic@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ c and speci@@ fic@@ ity anti @-@ D + e can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E serum .
in one given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as specified by the manufacturer .
is an serum to use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , so the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time of all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , will not be inf@@ erior to the ant@@ elop@@ e antibodies .
anti @-@ A Serum is gained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .

an Anti @-@ B Serum can be bl@@ ended on a sample bearer with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent rise of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same trial is done with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the Anti @-@ B blo@@ wers or with a standard pre @-@ par@@ at equal Avi@@ dity .
