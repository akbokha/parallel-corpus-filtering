the present document is a summary of the European Public Financial Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations concerning the application of medication .
if you require further information on your disease or treatment , please read the package instructions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ies .
for further information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Th@@ ink thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mis@@ sil@@ es and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , an psych@@ ic disorder in which patients have lack of periods ( Peri@@ ods abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bil@@ e is used to treat moderate to severe weather episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who spoke in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is applied to fast control of distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles when the oral medication should not be possible .
in both diseases , the solution can take the solution to remove or the hot tablets in patients , which the swal@@ lowing of tablets are prepared .
in patients who also take other medicines at the same time , it should be taken as fine @-@ proof , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bil@@ abil@@ ia .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells due to &quot; Neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ transmitter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of the ner@@ ve cells .
in particular Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably works as part of &quot; partial Ag@@ ents &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ transmitter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the ne@@ ural cre@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar failure to norm@@ alize the activity of brain , which avo@@ ids psychological or lack of symptoms and their re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of ad@@ sor@@ ption that re@@ occur the symptoms were examined in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in an experienced distur@@ b@@ ance , compared to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ e has over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of am@@ bil@@ ical and placebo which re @-@ appear to occur at 160 patients , where the lack of symptoms had been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ abil@@ ia .
the efficacy of am@@ bil@@ ical injection solution was observed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , who suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the symptoms of symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate , such as the body the melting tray and the solution for taking res@@ or@@ ating ( ascending ) .
in both studies with injection @-@ solution , patients who received A@@ bil@@ ling@@ ered in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of distur@@ b@@ ance than those who received a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting , A@@ bil@@ e did in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms most effective than placebo .
A@@ bil@@ e prevented for up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo this recur@@ r@@ ary episodes of previously treated patients and when it was added to an existing treatment .
am@@ bil@@ ical inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of distur@@ b@@ ance and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ ty ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( loss of movement ) , ob@@ itu@@ tion , nau@@ sea ( severe s@@ ali@@ va ) , ob@@ itu@@ tion , nau@@ sea ( loss of s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ itu@@ tion , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ) and anxi@@ ety .
the conclusion that the benefits for human phar@@ maceuticals ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bil@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and of medium @-@ severe episodes of patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the lack of human episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol spoke to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution for patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with lack of bi@@ polar periods in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd company . it has been granted approval for the placing on the market by A@@ bil@@ zio in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of severe weather episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - distur@@ b@@ ance and prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients which mainly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day ir@@ respective of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mono@@ therap@@ ist or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients a lower initial dose should be considered , if clinical factors are just@@ ify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor was removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the emergence of su@@ icides , psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , was reported in some cases after the onset or change of an anti@@ mental therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epidem@@ i@@ ological study demonstrated that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated su@@ icides with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other non @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should treat patients with known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressure disease ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ et@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that followed one year or less , there was occas@@ ional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if in case of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be withdrawn in consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms who have developed on a m@@ ns , or without a clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ es in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states which are used with c@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients had treated patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosing and the response to un@@ desired rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases an extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ coma or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ bi@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which can be observed , or un@@ healthy life , and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nerv@@ ous system , it is careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in combination with alcohol or other central verteb@@ rates are taken with themselves @-@ sto@@ cked side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant to be clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( China ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore similar dose cuts should be made .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism the common application can be used with high @-@ level inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ ma@@ c centr@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ mi@@ z@@ ole in comparison with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively @-@ intensive metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ level CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should the potential use of the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , with@@ ered similar effects , and therefore should make similar dose cuts .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram ( or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ) can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be counted with a constant increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substr@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ot@@ om@@ orph@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl ) .
the patients should be advised to notify your doctor when pregnant or pregnant women during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ sufficient amount of data on the safety of humans and due to the concerns of the animal studies in pregnancy , this medicine may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the potential use just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other non @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be war@@ ned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study conducted over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of less incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including car ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was reduced in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al therapy and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ee therapy .
man@@ ic@@ ular episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was included in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was reduced in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ mi@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups amongst Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and common cer@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
related to these events , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ mental therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ gen@@ esis , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases , un@@ wanted inf@@ am@@ cular events and increased mortality in elderly dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since its market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ si@@ fications were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death .
though there are no information on the effectiveness of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . it is un@@ likely that Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is used in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma detector .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ ene and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recipe .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 Shi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents in response to the study was observed in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from brass cells defined as secondary school courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ ress@@ rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al group and 57 % below placebo .
in a tran@@ sc@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients were observed in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies with more flexible dose of 3 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms more than 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ y@@ trial with 3 weeks having fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ eb@@ o- and active Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a lack of bi@@ polar or mixed det@@ ective , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and an effect effect that was comparable with the lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
also in week 12 a similar proportion of patients suffering from sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of the man@@ ie to be similar to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks of patients with a lack of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol y@@ ielded an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior to placebo superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly with the prevention of a feedback .
based on in vitro studies , the enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and the N @-@ deci@@ ph@@ ation is di@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ution life time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ zation via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics revealed no evidence to clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ ation @-@ de@@ hydr@@ ates were similar in patients with severe kidney failure . compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose @-@ study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to attract scar@@ fs on their met@@ abolic capacity .

Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials that followed one year or less , there was occas@@ ional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases an extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ coma or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ bi@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram ( or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ) can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be counted with a constant increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic@@ ular episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ rupt - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was included in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in a tran@@ sc@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients were observed in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ y@@ study conducted over 3 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies with a lack of visual or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol did not give to placebo no superior effectiveness .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form was compared to healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a cholesterol is determined as a result of the expul@@ sion of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( i.e. 1- and 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions in the 3 and 11@@ times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical minimum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to rapid control of ag@@ itation and behaviour in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with lack of bi@@ polar periods of bi@@ polar @-@ I faul@@ ts when an oral treatment is not attached .
as soon as it is attached clin@@ ically , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be completed and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in order to minim@@ ize the or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under changing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given dependent on individual clinical status under consideration of the medicine or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations regarding the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles that were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
if a par@@ ent@@ eral therapy with gasoline engines in addition to the arith@@ met@@ am@@ ol injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed in respect to severe se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
examinations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical @-@ po@@ is@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should treat patients with known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressure disease ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials that followed one year or less , there was occas@@ ional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high @-@ grade fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing awareness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ ers , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which can be observed , or un@@ healthy life , and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an increased significantly compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) and received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) to tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ists in Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , whereby this effect is not relevant to be clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ectors , with@@ ered similar effects , and therefore should make similar dose cuts .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular , was the intensity of the Sed@@ an compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .

107 . the following adverse events were more common to placebo ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical studies with oral @-@ aging Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was reduced in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups amongst Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and common cer@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al patients , compared to 2.0 % patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles was the arith@@ met@@ ic injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ oning / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ nost@@ ic disorder , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value at the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement is 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ ac@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed periods or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ acy , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be detected due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 Shi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents in response to the study was observed in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from brass cells defined as secondary school courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ asylum @-@ rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ee @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted more than 6 weeks of patients with a lack of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psychological characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol y@@ ielded an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a remission in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ ization period in front of Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly with the prevention of a feedback .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two for@@ ce@@ eds .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the peak plasma resistance from 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and ap@@ es and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment in an system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies to re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns of matern@@ al exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) to safety sp@@ elling , tox@@ icity with repeated treatment , reproduction , tox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gens potential , the pre@@ clinical data of no particular haz@@ ards could recognize in human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects were observed in dos@@ ages or exposure positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; so that they only limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects recorded a dos@@ si@@ onal side loss of peripheral tox@@ icity ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times of the medium steam @-@ state exposure ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition , cholesterol is found as a result of the eradi@@ cation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( i.e. 1- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study at 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , in which about three quarters were previously obtained with anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) the 229 with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
considering only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer have been identified for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , such as time as presum@@ ption of disease and survival was no difference between the disease .
however , in patients that had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , referring to these indicators , Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
it may also not be applied to people who are silent before the onset of low neut@@ rop@@ aid numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients who contained the first treatment , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines and that it must not be given to other medicines with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission adopted Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited received approval for the placing on the market of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neutral density &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or heavier sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y degrees 3 the treatment is easy to break up to grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function were performed and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ wired nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ ular formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other for@@ ce@@ ases of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
in case of an allergic reaction , the medicine should immediately be removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment are treated immediately , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no repeated Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be re@@ directed to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while an ill@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is not detected in connection with car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac deposits are not unusual , mainly in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ emet@@ ry and econom@@ izing resources .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be pract@@ ised in pregnant women or women for pregnant women who do not have an effective conception , unless the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in low @-@ age age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane a reliable editing method .
male patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is examined , during and up to six months after the treatment no child will bear witness .
male patients should advise themselves before the treatment of a sperm mot@@ ions since the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause any side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can work on the road transport and ability to operate machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking major hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quick reversible and dos@@ sier . Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia has been reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane and was serious seriously in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , these events are performed in conjunction with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as a mono@@ therap@@ ist at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated blood sugar , increased potassium in blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

pain in the chest face , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , genital pain , pain pain , pain pain , pain pain , dis@@ comfort in the lim@@ bs , muscle w@@ aking , very frequent :
re@@ visions 1 The frequency of su@@ pers@@ ens@@ ity actions is calculated based on a defin@@ itive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no c@@ tiv@@ al connection with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ic substance that promotes the storage of micro @-@ rot@@ ub@@ es from the Tub@@ ul@@ li@@ m@@ eren and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing its de@@ ol@@ ys@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma agents in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and has been demonstrated in the framework of in vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in transports the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transportation through g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ com@@ or is convey@@ ed through a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in c@@ yst@@ eine ) due to the alb@@ umin@@ aire protein P@@ ARC ( c@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two non @-@ blind trials and of 454 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion with metastatic breast cancer in 30 minutes .
this mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received a mono@@ therap@@ ist of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour infusion with relief for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute infusion with no medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ oma and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had received no chemotherapy previously , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to metast@@ ases and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ as@@ ing and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line therapy are described below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity towards P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree of patients who lived in at a time during therapy a peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 experienced , evaluated .
the natural progress of peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y on the basis of the cum@@ ulative Tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the total @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infusion of ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the effect of active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased linear between 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to the intraven@@ ous gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ c was taken at a multi@@ phase manner .
the total distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ cular distribution and / or pasture connection by P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic characteristics of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el have been compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minutes after an infusion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane compared with a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) as after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in the first line to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean concentration of cum@@ ulative total dose was less than 1 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abolic syndrome and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring .
in patients aged over 75 years , only few data are available , since only 3 patients participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected in light light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ er is similar to an organic drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; Reference En@@ ter &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal gl@@ ucose levels when in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ations , if a blood @-@ loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected in combination with a blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ations .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make use of an own eye , Ab@@ se@@ amed into a v@@ ein .
injection may also be done by the patient or care operator , provided that they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure or in patients who received chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ) .
the Iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron par@@ agus , and iron ore should be administered throughout the treatment .

it is produced by a cell that was introduced into a gene ( DNA ) that it was to be used for formation of epoxy in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed became in administration as injection into a v@@ ein in the framework of a major study of 479 patients who suffered in kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all of the patients participating E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they were either um@@ amed up or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
basic indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the variation of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of the skin spec@@ ulated by the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study conducted with patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were observed in the same dimensions as in those of those who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients showed E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ L .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a highly recommended spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ raine head@@ aches and tur@@ bul@@ ence .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients , which may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against epoxy in al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are necessary to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed - according to the regulations of the European Union of proof , it has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and effective profile of such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which sh@@ amed for the medical professionals in all Member States , will provide information regarding the safety of the pharmaceutical products .

An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome and fol@@ ds may vary depending on age , gender , and disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and sick@@ ness is required by the doctor .
an increase in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s can be observed occasionally or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ - target concentration .

the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood screening program - so that before the start of the se@@ um@@ amed therapy big iron reserves are available .
6 The recommended dosage covers 600 i.e. / kg ep@@ och in al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery procedure and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) should be given .
this should be followed by ep@@ ilep@@ tic in al@@ fa 300 i.e. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the procedure as well as 4 days immediately after the procedure .
alternatively , injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis using a thread needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ on@@ ical sal@@ ine solution to ensure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine by means of the cycle .

controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ och@@ s , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ con@@ cent@@ ation is higher when monitoring blood trans@@ f@@ usi@@ ons and avoi@@ ding blood trans@@ f@@ usi@@ ons .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster rise should amount to approximately 1 g / d@@ L ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ent heart disease , suff@@ iciency should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets under section 4.2 .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ och@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency in adults is in@@ suff@@ iciently charged with kidney failure that are not di@@ aly@@ sis on failure .
for the evaluation of therapy in tumour patients , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa gift and the Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response should be taken into account ( patients , which may be trans@@ f@@ ished ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ un@@ conditional an@@ emia - Dos@@ age between 10 g / dl and 12 g / d@@ L ) .
the decision for the application of combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction under participation of the respective patient , which should take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , at the beginning of the ep@@ och in @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be treated and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go to an extra @-@ effective or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure should have a reasonable risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with a under@@ lying cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting point value of &gt; 13 g / s an increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can be established .
in several controlled trials , it was not demonstrated that patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia should improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumor diabetes .

survival and tumor @-@ ies were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials , and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in patients and controls .

overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complic@@ ations with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and insp@@ ections .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients that are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in , and negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are treated for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in in tumour patients who were treated with chemotherapy , as far as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that de@@ br@@ ittle the bones ) both at women and in men as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone break ) , including in patients who suffered a low trau@@ matic hat@@ s like the bone of the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone to changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) due to injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms in the three days after the infusion of infusion , such as fever , muscle pain , fur@@ ther@@ ness similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , was a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ ral and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in over 50 years , who had recently suffered a hip correction ; the number of questionn@@ aires were examined over a period of up to five years .
in case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ l@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , the bone structure ) in serum ( an enzyme , the bone structure ) in the blood , norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates for people under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ e@@ opath@@ y ) , with those under Placebo , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip correction , 9 % of patients suffer from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to placebo ( 92 out of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under Placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after infusion , and are less frequent in repeated infusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be applied in patients that may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or one of the other components .
patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to infusion location and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a puts out re@@ conn@@ aissance materials for doctors who prescri@@ bes A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who are explained in the side effects of the drugs and it should be noted when they should consult the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic rolling correction , the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational force of the hip structure ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long remission period was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supplements of calcium , always at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a reduced low @-@ trau@@ matic li@@ mat@@ h correction , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ infusion .
the prevalence of symptoms which may occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney disease ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ aring &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experiences for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because this patient population has only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ thal@@ emia is before the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sufficient supplements of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , the bone structure can develop a temporary , mit@@ om@@ atic Hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supplements of calcium , always at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .

11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ l@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months of comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain was observed after 6 months in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified to treatment at the end of the six @-@ month study ( respon@@ ding to therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 associated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of those treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was compared with 71 of the patients treated with risk analysis of 18 months after application .
one @-@ one and multiple 5 and 15 minutes for Inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that is known as dos@@ sier .
after that the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Financial Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) is evaluated in order to get recommendations concerning the application of medication .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be used alone ( mono@@ therap@@ ies ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with another diabet@@ ic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be adjusted with Met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ cence or ins@@ ulin , the existing dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ l@@ ym@@ s or ins@@ ulin may be maintained , except in patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced by the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ l@@ ym@@ s or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be util@@ ized and the blood gl@@ ucose level sin@@ ks , reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in using a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ l@@ ative , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tu@@ als led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which allows blood gl@@ ucose levels when applying doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional treatment of action to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ res@@ cence in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift from placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who participated in addition to ins@@ ulin took a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % compared to 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in those patients .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were se@@ duc@@ ed disorders , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity opposite Rei@@ zen ) .
Ac@@ tu@@ als may not react to patients either in patients with liver problems , heart failure , heart failure or diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ( high point level - acidity - in the blood ) .
it was decided that action within a mon@@ otherapy ( at all use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients should not appear on which Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission adopted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the markings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient and in@@ compatibility due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for patients under 18 years of age , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is not available for patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or eye @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserves .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and an eye @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
cardiovascular disease was carried out with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ ular disease .
this study showed an increase in response to cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of the liver disease Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ es are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient have developed symptoms which indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , re@@ build holes , ti@@ red@@ ness , appet@@ ite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values .
the decision to whether the treatment in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be directed until the pres@@ crip@@ tions of the laboratory parameters can be directed by clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ si@@ onal weight gain was detected that by fat deposits , and in some cases are connected to a liquid .
as a result of the treatment , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one introduced a minor reduction of medium @-@ sized hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed during similar studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ye by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , patients who received Pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral dual - or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ si@@ est hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ c@@ ils , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a emergence or deteri@@ oration of diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular ed@@ ema with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ed@@ ema , but the possibility of a mac@@ ular ed@@ ema should be aware of if patients may be considered to be considered as a degree of ophthalm@@ ologic studies .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of notification of un@@ desirable events in this randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative clinical practice .
in the trial study , a study conducted more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular diseases , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a reference medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes you a pregnancy or enter it , the treatment is given ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies in interaction of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmac@@ ology of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medication which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by this enzyme , e.g. oral contra@@ diction , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ tors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the Council ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , in pregnancy , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistant to the parent &apos;s disease and thus decre@@ asing the availability of met@@ abolic rate .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 ; often &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ f and the core index of the lens , as well as other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances are observed .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ st@@ ents came across than thre@@ e@@ fold between the upper limit of the standard area , commonly referred to as under Placebo , but less than in comparison groups below Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ l@@ stoff .
in a Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ular disease the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , it has been reported to be in@@ suff@@ iciency with Pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more frequently , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was in combination with ins@@ ulin failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese in combination with ins@@ ulin failure .
an summar@@ izing analysis of notification of un@@ desirable events in this randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were treated with reference @-@ medi@@ ation groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of running Pro@@ active trial , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days showed no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work via a activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) which leads in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , grease and sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ kel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral gl@@ cos@@ ever@@ s in case of ins@@ ulin resistant .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after onset of therapy , a blood gl@@ ucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be performed by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients who received blood sugar despite ins@@ ulin @-@ in@@ suff@@ ice , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who received just ins@@ ulin at the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
in clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ therap@@ ies with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small cell examination on type 2 diabetes m@@ ics in a small group of 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as mar@@ gin@@ ally higher LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .

in comparison to Plaz@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , there was no statistically significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were observed .
in a study on 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the n@@ avy tri@@ glyc@@ eride , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ ce increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also improved through a effect on the Tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic Tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy .
according to oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak con@@ cent@@ ation to the un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , generally 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in about the three times of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmac@@ ology of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

according to the active application of radio@@ active mark@@ ised pi@@ o@@ glyc@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was mainly found in the spring ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the resin ( 45 % ) .
the medium plasma elim@@ ination of plasma @-@ Eli@@ mination of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to men 5 @-@ 6 hours , while the total active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ ric of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , but resem@@ ble the rates of oral det@@ erg@@ ance .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce an ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the ins@@ ulin .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that blood sugar levels were lowered considerably as with another human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients that may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) on human @-@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found ) .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S by the European Commission for placing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are normally applied once or twice a day if a fast initi@@ ale effect is w@@ ished with a longer lasting effect .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already mentioned signs of Crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( stones ) , i.e. greater man@@ rat@@ ory deposits , which can lead to gel and bone damages ) .
if the ur@@ inary acid is still more than 6 mg per Dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , ra@@ ins can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that the patient should take at least for the prevention of tox@@ ins at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study enrolled in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( a medic@@ inal medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . compared to the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg . patients with kidney problems only received 100 mg a day .
the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid concentration in the blood was below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of revenues , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients receiving a dose of 120 mg , with the last three measurements obtained a ur@@ inary acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / d@@ L .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients were under Placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with heart failure in pre @-@ history , possibly a increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ ge acid in the blood of more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to U@@ rat@@ es@@ deposits ( including one from the ambul@@ ance known or present in@@ feed and / or a plaster ) .
if the serum concentration after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , can be considered a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with heavy kidney restrictions , the efficacy and safety date has not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people who have no experiences with children and adolescents , is not recommended by the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group .

cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ emia heart disease or de@@ cent heart failure - treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ res@@ sources , it can come to an acute tox@@ ins during treatment of treatment , because the decrease of the serum concentration is initially mobil@@ ized in the tissue .
B . at mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in ur@@ ine in rare cases so far would rise to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies have been observed with slight disorders of the liver function when treated with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver work before the start of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ al treatment and in the course of clinical results ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ was carried out no time studies to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O Hem@@ p could lead to an increase of the Met@@ abol@@ isation of The@@ oph@@ yl@@ lin ( also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
at subjects the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ al exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

pregnancy Data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t have to exclu@@ de side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animals do not allow animal experiments on direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful in case of a vehicle , respon@@ ding machines or during exercise of hazardous activities , until they be reas@@ on@@ ably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance .
a final higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported in the whole of phase 3 ( 1.3 vs. 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found , and no significant correlation with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at was found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic condition and / or a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ cent heart failure in case of medical history .

7 Open @-@ time extension studies in the open long @-@ time extension studies were 906 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported in the long term - renewal of studies were similar to those who have been reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups more than once and performed in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to data occasionally .
the following treatments related events were either reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these cans either even or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and tox@@ ins .
the primary end@@ point of efficacy was in each study the proportion of patients who were the last three monthly serum concentration &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cancer value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant over@@ stress in patients with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg / L ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment of conventional used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant over@@ stress in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the decrease of the serum concentration is increased to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , while the physician attendance was observed in week 2 and maintained permanently about the whole treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cancer patients &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with cardi@@ oid limitations ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary action point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in relation to the percentage of serum concentration of serum concentration ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl - 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had to study at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) for a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years presented in the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients have required an incidence of tox@@ ins ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients ) required against a tox@@ ins ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required ) .
this was associated with a reduction in gi@@ cht@@ k@@ not@@ ation size , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the banknotes up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in recent long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and the area below the plasma cent@@ ric time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at was disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately after administration of a sim@@ pler and multi @-@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg .
for a dose of 120 mg and 300 mg , it is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase of AU@@ C which is greater than the dos@@ sier .
after intake of simple or multifunctional doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage of serum concentration was observed , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , when the bone breaks ) are used for women after men@@ op@@ ause , with a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or remove other medicines ( including ant@@ acids da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the cooking e , the patient may not leave the patient at the earliest 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from other medicines that are approved in the European Union , the Company collected data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than for those who only receive Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to suggest that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of motion control ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ectives ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , Con@@ di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , dy@@ ub@@ ag@@ ie ( swal@@ low cases ) , swal@@ lowed abdom@@ en ( puff@@ ins ) , as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allerg@@ y ) to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or any other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be applied in disorders of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of medication ( including ant@@ acids da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) for the day .
the following references are exactly to follow the risk of mal@@ op@@ ic irrit@@ ation and thus associated adverse events ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be ro@@ uted after the day of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) of the day , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is supposed to be taken before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ . ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only be given with special attention ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ r@@ ins@@ ane reactions , such as ov@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the taking of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these serious discussions and required a hospital expul@@ sion ) .
the doctor &apos;s therefore atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms resulting in potential so@@ unding reactions , and the patients are supposed to be pointed out at the occurr@@ ence of symptoms and retro@@ sp@@ ern@@ al pain or new , or contra@@ di@@ fying the medicine to take up medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe severe adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that indicate an adverse irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing assign@@ ments shall be transmitted to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , rarely ( after market launch ) Magn@@ um and Du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , some seriously wounded and related complic@@ ations ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the setting of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need an oral surgical procedure to reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the pine .
the clinical assessment of the doctor &apos;s treatment is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be requested to take the tablet consuming a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet next morning after taking their su@@ peri@@ ority .
they do not take two tablets the same day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases resulting from the mineral waters ( such as vitamin D deficiency and p@@ itu@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can deterior@@ ate the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
as a result , the patient must wait at least 30 minutes after intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clinical relevant interaction .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore neither is neither the women to apply for pregnant women .

in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
main inde@@ struc@@ tive of the effectiveness was the number of patients when the tran@@ spl@@ ant was dropped after a year from a year ( by example , how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter studies were performed on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splantation and analysed c@@ agra@@ f in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ mot@@ ic therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ants are familiar to this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ants or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ stitution or over@@ immun@@ ity .
patients always should maintain the same tac@@ kl@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or reg@@ imes should only be carried out under the narrow control of one in the tran@@ splantation by experienced medicine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of an alternative to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ages must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dose of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of har@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in detail and on blood @-@ level rules ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after upgrading from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ar should be controlled from the change@@ over and over two weeks after migration .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposition was measured as a bottom level , with both form@@ ulations both with kidney disease and le@@ ber@@ tran@@ splan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ar level are recommended for the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation by us agra@@ f to ensure an appropriate substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring , can take a change of the agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow the disease treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the manufacture of infusion pump ) may be re@@ directed at a dose of approx . 5 mg / ml .
duration of the application to the suppression of gra@@ ft reactions must be observed ; consistent , therefore , a maximum duration of oral treatment cannot be specified .
dietary recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ fts of gra@@ ft therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
additional dos@@ ages can be later necessary since the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dietary recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ fts of gra@@ ft therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - conversion by Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ agra@@ f you need a tran@@ spl@@ ant of daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a time daily dosage at a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ splantation After a transition from other immune soup to Adv@@ agra@@ f every day the treatment with the oral starting dose for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft spher@@ ical dose begin .
the heart tran@@ spl@@ ant for adult patients who participate in Adv@@ agra@@ f is a oral starting dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ants are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in pneum@@ onia , pan@@ cre@@ as and inf@@ ectious patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intest@@ inal tran@@ spl@@ ant in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bl@@ utt@@ ings in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function a her@@ al@@ ate of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function since the kidney function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cancer is recommended , a calculation of canc@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ating and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In the transition from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ e - based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the bottom level in full blood . the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of har@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in single cases under sub@@ sid@@ y Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ar insp@@ ections .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls from the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ bot from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also follow the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustments , changes to immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy , or with the benefit of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Pi@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low cle@@ aring , the dose may require several days , until the Ste@@ ady State occurred .
the data in clinical trials can close that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the bottom level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lies in the first time after liver tran@@ splant@@ ations usually within the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with in@@ du@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent re@@ tention of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or Over@@ exposure .
patients always should maintain the same tac@@ kl@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or reg@@ imes should only be carried out under the narrow control of one in the tran@@ splantation by experienced medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 . for the treatment of growing patients with gra@@ fts , which proved to be more immune to other immun@@ o@@ deficiency , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ aining formulation of the formulation .
the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant gra@@ fts in adult heart gra@@ fts and tran@@ spl@@ ants in childhood are still no clinical data for the ret@@ aining formulation .
due to potential interaction which can lead to a reduction of Tac@@ ro@@ climate mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) is contained , or other plant sound during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ climate concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subject to fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f could be seen as a kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y , aque@@ ous or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which is thus possible at Cal@@ agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference , a treatment with corrosion resistance , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid over@@ load and ov@@ ulation .
as with other immune l@@ ress@@ ants the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of skin by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protective factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms of p@@ res like head@@ aches , changing corne@@ al state , cr@@ amps and vision , should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g .

simultaneous application of medicines or plant extracts , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing blood values from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it therefore advis@@ able to monitor the tac@@ tic level of blood levels in the same gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the tac@@ kl@@ ash dose for maintaining more consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the enhanced oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal contamination , resulted in .
high @-@ do@@ si@@ ated pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute di@@ vor@@ ous reactions , may increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on metabolism of other medic@@ inal wor@@ sen@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs can be met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will come down the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ diction , and thus increase the hormon@@ es , is particularly careful in decisions of receiving di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .

adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( due to the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application can be applied later to whether Adv@@ oc@@ ates are applied for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgery .
patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack , causing bleeding problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that was introduced into a gene ( DNA ) that it was to be used to education the human cl@@ ine factor VIII .
one is another in the European Union approved medic@@ inal product called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , unlike , however , is made differently , so that the phar@@ maceuticals does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe , severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention .
in the main study the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sec@@ uted periods was awarded &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
the rate may not be applied in patients that may be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission adopted B@@ ax@@ ter AG issued a licence for authorisation in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution is subject to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defect , according to the place and the degree of blood and clinical state of patients .
by the following rh@@ ag@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII in the appropriate period should not fall under the specified plasma concentration ( in % of the standard or in i.e. , i.e. , dl / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute infection are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is passed by the patient .
during treatment it is applied to control the administered dose and frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ sts .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , varying in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ it@@ ments .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight at a gap of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed in order to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be carried out .
the appoint@@ ments should be addressed to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity by factor VIII Framework Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , who are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ act days is the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positi@@ onal days and known as well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors was developed , after migration of a combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed , the re@@ occur of ( lower tit@@ res ) inhibit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare occur@@ ence of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s greatest number of inhibit@@ ors were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated advanced risk to formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is estimated ) .

based on the data available , the CH@@ MP has continued to have the benefit @-@ risk provisions on the basis of which the safety profile has been closely monitored for the following reasons :
the CH@@ MP has therefore been based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation procedure should apply another renewal process in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited adopted the Committee on Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company intends to withdraw his application for the placing on the market from Mr. Li &apos;s Cancer Organisation for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .

this is a kind of virus , the genet@@ ically modified that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; that has changed so that there are no copies of itself and therefore no infections be dis@@ sol@@ ving in humans .
advanced in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and allow to reduce the cancer cells to form a normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made out of the non @-@ def@@ ectives in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually caused to restore damaged DNA and to kill cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and split up .
the company put data from a study of a study involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ building , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answer of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company by the company on Day 120 .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not suff@@ iciently demonstrated that injection of the Adv@@ oc@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours are given advantages for patients .
the Committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medicines in the body , the type of administration as well as security of medication .
in addition , the company had not demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way , and that neither the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is harmful .
the Company , the CH@@ MP , was not aware of it if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently involved in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed action @-@ release &quot; means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is slowly released over a couple of hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergi@@ en@@ itis ( ha@@ ylo@@ ft , caused by an allerg@@ y to poll@@ en inflamm@@ ation of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ In@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken all with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated immediately when the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( cr@@ um@@ bs nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effectiveness of the sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ ylo@@ ft was reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients treated their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when consideration all the ha@@ st@@ ating of the nose notes , the patients reported to the in@@ con@@ gest@@ ation of the nose , with Aer@@ in@@ plant &apos;s revenues , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in the patients receiving P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a decrease of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ In@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ach@@ ometer , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , mental pain , red@@ ness , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ Box may not be applied to patients who may ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulated ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , or one of the other components , against ad@@ mitt@@ ent active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ in@@ et can also be used in patients treated with a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , or already had a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for placing Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s placing sites in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is it all to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them too hard to break down or cut down ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to the absence of data for in@@ ference and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after cl@@ ing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days because when long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ uri@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin is able to take time .
after the decline of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breathing , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ile can be continued as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .

this is attributable to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ in , Per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ ot@@ oline , di@@ chloride , di@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective , and the data do not suff@@ ice to expos@@ e appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ atics were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data are not enough to arrange adequate recommendations for the dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment at the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ y@@ arm or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ y@@ cardiovascular disease , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen of other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( like head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be canc@@ eled .
in the treatment of the following patient groups to be careful : • patients under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , bladder cancer , or Bron@@ ci@@ bu@@ ds in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ ista is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ika , otherwise positive response to indicators for skin reaction , or can be reduced in their magnitude .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were added in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma cent@@ ric of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ os@@ ol tests no significant differences between the treated patients were detected , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other drugs can not be excluded .

the in@@ solvency of the application of Aer@@ in@@ fest@@ ation during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since realis@@ ing studies of animals not always be transferred to humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ous characteristics of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impair@@ ment or ability to control machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , min@@ ded mental attention , cy@@ an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ation ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ading , conv@@ ection ) with possible le@@ ases .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , just like At@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ iness , pup@@ il / rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mic and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the elec@@ toral P @-@ selection of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in case of a single dose @-@ study , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg not showed an influence on standard measurement sizes of flight output including rein@@ forcement sub@@ j@@ ectors or tasks that are linked to the flies .
in controlled clinical studies , at recommended dose of 5 mg , no increased frequency of sl@@ an@@ ness in comparison to placebo was determined .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage may cause more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ et@@ ical effects such as an increase of blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer system or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ atic tablets , determined by the overall score for the sympt@@ om ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ ine sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ atics tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ ine sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin via the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose @-@ study on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ ingrad , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma .
according to the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flowing weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin on day 10 was reached .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics multi @-@ dos@@ sier , which was conducted with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin po@@ or@@ ly disp@@ uted .
a component @-@ interaction study indicates that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin is severe in exposure to the treatment of an aer@@ ob@@ atic tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ elling , tox@@ icity within a repet@@ itive gift , for re@@ bo@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any special d@@ angers to humans .
the combination did no longer tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the observed effects were generally in connection with the content P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four trials for seasonal allergi@@ es and two trials in patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of pain , impair@@ ment of sleep and the performance of the days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body provides the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tray in the same way as the tablets and use in children is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in an allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the sympt@@ om scores ( sympt@@ om@@ points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies in ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the sympt@@ om scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % for patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us cannot be applied in patients that may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence for authorisation from A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .

treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease and may be resum@@ ed after removal of symptoms .
in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during the allergi@@ es .
clinical @-@ relevant interaction were not found in the framework of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were added in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ maceuticals study , am@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not ampli@@ fied the performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in this respect , in very rare cases , it can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment or ability to use machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events which were more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dried ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and were treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ ric clinical dose ) .
this includes both the release of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the fra@@ sion@@ ism P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple sockets , administered in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety @-@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ sier study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg not showed an influence on standard measurement sizes of flight output including rein@@ forcement sub@@ j@@ ectors or tasks that are linked to the flies .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the relief of symptoms such as ni@@ otic , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching in the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , the in@@ flow of the eyes and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as indicated by the total score of the questionnaire for the life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of seasonal allergi@@ es .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , representing the under@@ lying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology , as the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the gen@@ e@@ ology similar to the different shapes and can be recruited by chronic patients .
since the hist@@ amine release is a factor of a factor of all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also associated with other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria in an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of pris@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of tor@@ tures at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies , with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority in patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , was excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching up more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergi@@ en@@ itis in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved .
there are no applications for clinical relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 cannot in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ sier with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not provide the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin .
the clinical trials performed by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin demonstrated in a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ ic@@ ate fil@@ s of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ elling , tox@@ icity with repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive reductions let the pre@@ clinical data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any special d@@ angers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre @-@ treated that support a treatment of an inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , we should play an role in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical examinations , and skin analyses .
for example , about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ ab@@ using des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experienced a higher sub@@ tle load ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , partly met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes , is identical to those with children who met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze normal .

clinical @-@ relevant interaction were not found in the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking of am@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not ampli@@ fied the performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total effects of the adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ us Group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
in an extra @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , who were given up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times of clinical dose ) no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were treated for anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ inated therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ ds of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar to extra@@ pol@@ ate the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg was used daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety @-@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets produced in adults and adolescents in clinical studies in no impair@@ ment of the Psych@@ os@@ cal@@ ory .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against influenza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which may cause a trunk of influenza ri@@ mp , which may cause a future P@@ andem@@ ic .
a influenza p@@ andem@@ ic breaks out when a new trunk of Gri@@ pp@@ av@@ irus is di@@ ver@@ ted , which is easily locked by man to man , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine system , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influenza virus and forms the antibody against it .
this makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this m@@ am@@ ms fast antibodies .
afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es surface , det@@ ects the human body as body alien ) and is used as a component of vacc@@ ination .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this means that the scope of clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine is not enough to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre@@ p@@ andem@@ ic vacc@@ ines .

it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , the gen@@ ase can be used as a solution for inser@@ ting , but these can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has been checked , which has an an@@ tivir@@ al medicine of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has made that the virus may appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is governed by body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , but can do the damage of the immune system , so that the development of AIDS related infections and diseases can do .
A@@ gen@@ ase was tested in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing .
this R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medic@@ inal drug was compared with low prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
basic indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had not taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , they had a vir@@ al load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but am@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also had the vir@@ al load , but of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing , only very few of the treatment said .
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the vir@@ us@@ load increased after 16 @-@ weeks treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under the gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks as in the patient receiving their previous prototypes :
most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue strength ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also not be applied with patients , the cur@@ rant ( a plant preparation for the treatment of depression ) or phar@@ maceuticals , which are the same as A@@ gen@@ ase , and in high concentrations in the blood of health are harmful .
like other medicines for HIV in patients who take A@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ deficiency ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or immun@@ o@@ deficiency syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of infection that will cause prolonged immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of treated HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ etic amplifiers R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee pointed out that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not detected .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since the approval of scientific reasons only had limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission adopted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approved a approval for the placing of A@@ gen@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 certified , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic Boo@@ bs of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r should be done under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance of the patients and the pre@@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % less than by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams base is not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for te@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ b@@ vi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 . when A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for axial capsules is 20 mg am@@ b@@ lown / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs for a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic , efficacy and safety of am@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the absence of data for in@@ ference and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application is intended to be used in patients with mild or even liver function when patients with severe liver function is contra@@ cted in patients with severe liver function ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and display substr@@ ates of the P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable choices , which contain cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) may not be applied due to the risk of the plasma cent@@ ric and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy should not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they can still develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complic@@ ations of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents the risk of a transfer of HIV to others due to sexual contact or contamination with blood .
the gen@@ ase capsules are usually used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver tur@@ bul@@ ence with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ nets , which are over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ro@@ ost@@ ero@@ y effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the tri@@ but@@ ary function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the reduction of the H@@ MG Co@@ a reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ y including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standards Ratio ) , methods to determine the concentration of concentration .
in patients that use this medicine at the same time , am@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma pillars from Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is used simultaneously with Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ou@@ ss@@ ome , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk content of a tox@@ icity according to the high prop@@ aganda solution of the A@@ gen@@ ase Solution , this formulation is contra@@ cted by children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be reduced to a duration of 5 if a mixture of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , associated as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing , are reports of an increase of blood cells including spont@@ aneous syn@@ op@@ ic hem@@ at@@ omes and ha@@ w@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) is able to develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical reasons , or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fac@@ t@@ ori@@ elle etching , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ isation , higher body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in particular cases were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic beam of A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that represent a small therapeutic width and display substr@@ ates of the P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic beam of A@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be conf@@ used together with drugs , whose results are mainly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r caused by a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resistance development .
in an attempt to balance the lowest plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects were observed in the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations led by Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
if a patient has already engaged in Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ b@@ lown up mirror up and when possible to check the vir@@ al load and depos@@ iting the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary when clo@@ ves is administered together with Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r ( see also E@@ se@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ lown capsule ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , aff@@ ecting the efficacy and in@@ fertil@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ sol@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved at the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ sol@@ r + 100 mg of ra@@ cl@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended that the effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics in combination with di@@ alog@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ her@@ b@@ icide component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the income from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , in combination with Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with ir@@ rig@@ ation in combination with Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both proteins were low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and available data can be assumed that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin could possibly be reduced by Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or sub@@ therapeutic plasma bar .
when this medicine is applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be performed , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fug@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma cent@@ ric ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ az@@ ut@@ in around 193 % and thereby to an increase of Ri@@ o@@ ut@@ in related side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ pp@@ ut@@ in is to be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , at least half the recommended dose may be recommended in at least half of the recommended dose although no clinical data are required .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with gen@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma level of both medicines might be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r daily used to increase the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma at 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ year ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times a day without simultaneous use of f@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r daily with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions which are linked with these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of non @-@ vul@@ si@@ ants that are known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , can cause am@@ b@@ lown up to a lower plasma level of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium can@@ al@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pine , cur@@ b pin , n@@ ast@@ pin , n@@ ast@@ pin , n@@ man@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r , possibly the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine is increased .
a con@@ gest@@ ion with am@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma cent@@ ric ability and strengthen P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ations , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were reported to reduce the fluid deficiency ( 90 % interval between 82 % and 89 % ) .
however , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of developing a risk of system@@ ic cor@@ om@@ ial effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ atin , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , these findings of plasma levels have been expected to be expected by a@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or for my@@ opath@@ y , including a RNA dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended using Am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r .
it is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations of up to stabil@@ ization of mirror , since the plasma cent@@ ric run by Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
thus , the gen@@ ase must not be applied together with oral @-@ taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while the use of corne@@ al with par@@ ent@@ eral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is offered .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ent@@ eral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase of the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 to 4 fold .
when Meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ou@@ ss@@ ome , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the lower reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at present , such as Am@@ b@@ lown av@@ ir@@ - dose when Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r is given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
for the benefit of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , an enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International Standards ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended with the benefit of gen@@ ic gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied to the mother &apos;s possible risks for the fet@@ us during pregnancy after careful provisions of the possible uses .
in the milk @-@ activated rats , Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ lown up for people in breast milk .
a Re@@ productive study on impair@@ ment rats that was administered by immig@@ ration to the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding time was Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during the down@@ time .
the further development of re@@ prob@@ ation including fertil@@ ity and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the in@@ solvency of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and for children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment inter@@ related side effects were slightly to moder@@ ately pronounced , came early in early and led rarely to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the administration of a@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the fundamental disease .
most of the mentioned effects were from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or were not treated with 1200 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were identified by the examination as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as the treatment of treatment adjustments ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral t@@ issues , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ k@@ al fat collection ( bull ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated people treated with Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 performed at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
skin wor@@ ries usually were slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or mac@@ ular nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and appeared spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without leaving the treatment with Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular cases were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disorder or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to the common or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI was observed twice daily with low @-@ endo@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and were observed ; one exception were enh@@ ancements of tri@@ glyc@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ conden@@ sing R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is necessary on signs of a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , when necessary , the necessary support measures are required .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ con@@ cent@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is within the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells
the relation between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
patients with treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as described in other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ es with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
in sixteen years of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r daily at the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure could be evaluated up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure within the 59 included , showed non @-@ treated patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or showed resistance patterns which were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 66@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or to patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic evaluation systems can be applied to estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 4.@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased ph@@ eas@@ ant resistance to F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation pattern can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended always to use the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , the phen@@ otyp@@ ic evaluation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( partitions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r annex@@ ed genetic pattern generates a certain clo@@ ister against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ ly and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally accepted .
there are currently data for the sac@@ red@@ ness between Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients , such a resistance to L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 ins@@ om@@ is@@ ans ) , In@@ vi@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
early sl@@ ump of a reconc@@ ile therapy is recommended to keep the enrich@@ ment of a variety of mut@@ ations in bound@@ aries that can affect the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the efficacy of am@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ onius ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven viruses sensitivity opposite A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the research case A by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in comparison to the period adjusted ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ disease threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ born ag@@ ast@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution was examined twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ conden@@ sed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who received A@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered as expected benefit from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ lown ves approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approx . 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for a reduction of 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ b@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ lown up 12 hours after the dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) imp@@ acted by food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be moved to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered Pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ b@@ lown up from the t@@ issues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the plasma in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r , which remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ le@@ d@@ b@@ lown up remains constant , the percentage of free active components were fluctu@@ ation during the dosing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state in the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore , phar@@ maceuticals , or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ itions or the substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given to caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

local skin actions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions proceed in general during therapy or reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reaction , a treatment period can be made within several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after re@@ generation of treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , if there should be more suitable treatments at super fi@@ zi@@ ary bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and other suitable therapy forms .
in patients with recur@@ rent or previously untreated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences . therefore , the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ stick or on the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the data on the tin@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis to the low arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application case , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin actions occur frequently , but these reactions proceed to intensity in the course of intensity or after putting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reaction will cause big dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study revealed that patients with more than 8 ac@@ companies may lower a lower full treatment rate as a patient with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied to treat patients who received an immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
studies of veter@@ inary studies do no direct or indirect effects of the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ ov@@ ale development , the child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after having a distinct application , the anti@@ fi@@ able serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be reached , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding time .
most common and possibly as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in studies with three weeks of severe treatment , local reactions were at the place of treatment of pig@@ tails ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ e@@ oma patients treated from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , possibly as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection were a reaction on the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events that were specified by 252 in plac@@ eb@@ con@@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with tin@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this according to the audit committee of the clinical signs indicates that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can often occur frequently to local skin reaction ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ oriander ( 23 % ) and oil content ( 14 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) .
this according to the audit committee of the clinical signs indicates that it was very often associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and a heavy scra@@ per ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ z@@ ie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) in the treatment office or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ advert@@ ent one @-@ off @-@ off intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to contents of approximately 16 bags could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe tri@@ bution , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , norm@@ alized in Hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized themselves as an oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic tests were detected based on the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increased concentrations of the Alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ es and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that efficacy in relation to a complete remission of wr@@ ist treatment at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to placebo over 16 weeks .
in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients treated patients , this was 20 % of the patients treated with placebo patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete remission could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in fifth application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the aim was hist@@ ologically confirmed by individual primary super fi@@ b@@ ular bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
out of an open @-@ long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically treated and this also remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ic les@@ ions within a related 25 cm2 of treatment authority than on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .

Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream due to the skin of 58 patients with tin@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weeks of weekly use .
serum concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this shows an extended re@@ tention of medication in the skin .
data on the system@@ ic exposition showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od according to top@@ ical application of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with tin@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ professional bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
during a four @-@ month study of the der@@ mal tox@@ icity in the treatment of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg , kg doses taken to significantly lower body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study of four months of the study on the latest application was not similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice in mice was reduced to three days a week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ iny , is a risk of the person due to the system@@ ic exposure as very low .

in the study , mainly the safety of the pharmac@@ ies was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by reducing its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentrations in the ur@@ ine um increased by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal liver on the end of the trial .
most common adverse events of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , skin cancer ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat and fever and reactions to the infusion place .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ at ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and Schüt@@ t .
Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) , not applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year all new information that may be announced , and this summary must be updated .
the manufacturer of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the In@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission adopted G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ alian Cell Culture ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ O , E@@ ating floor of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of Mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary con@@ com@@ bat@@ ant diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h may be increased when the patient increases this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no met@@ ering scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop inf@@ usi@@ oned reactions which are defined as each in connection , which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored again , and the infusion of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be done within a reasonable clinical environment , in which res@@ or@@ ating equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 clinical trial , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment begins .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction must be treated with caution of Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because little experience is pre @-@ established after treatment after a longer break , must be careful due to the theoretical increased risk of a sensitive reaction reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ det@@ ach@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential appearance of inf@@ usi@@ oned reactions .
in case of light or moderate inf@@ ant @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be treated and / or a reduction of infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate when the response occurred .
in case of single , heavy inf@@ ant @-@ related reaction , the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .

Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ fer@@ encing involving intra@@ cellular recording of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
pet experimental studies do not allow to direct or indirect effects of the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated across lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase across the breast milk , is recommended to non @-@ quiet during the treatment with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse reactions were included in clinical trials which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently used in the following table according to the following table names : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in the history , severe reactions were also represented , including Bron@@ o@@ bu@@ ds , breathing and visual fields ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desirable medicines in connection with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported in a phase 2 study with 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe distribution form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg IV ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients appeared within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ op@@ ic version , whereas in the age of 5 years with severe exp@@ editions usually occurred within one month to a ser@@ ene version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ex@@ crete from the study ) there were no antibody being prov@@ able in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low risk levels found a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ antibodies , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was determined .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal prop@@ ens@@ ity to a low neutral inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of un@@ desirable pharmaceutical @-@ actions , even when the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drugs reactions were typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme therapy is located in a sub@@ jection of the cum@@ ulative Sub@@ str@@ ate and the preventing another accum@@ ulation of sufficient stim@@ ulation of final activity .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the blood and cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely learn about Mann@@ ers @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me were included in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were randomised to recru@@ it the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients showed the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient demonstrated the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients were treated with Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the placebo group a improvement of lung function and the ability to be displayed in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining that effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further proportional to the height @-@ growing children .
of the 26 patients with a therapeutic index of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decline of G@@ AG mirrors were detected in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) who remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease @-@ manifest@@ ation between the patients receiving by using a combined final point , one range in 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement range of shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acuity ) was generally a improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study carried out primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients were examined at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe w@@ asting form and 4 with the middle screw type ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
several patients showed a higher percentage growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ iry form only limited or not yet to determine progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study tests on pharmac@@ ology effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ es were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg IV ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the met@@ ering scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be seen in patients who have difficulty with weekly Inf@@ usi@@ ons , but it is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less affected patients .

the initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h may be increased when the patient increases it , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with heavier MP@@ S @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs have occurred serious reactions , including Bron@@ o@@ bu@@ ds , breathing and visual acuity .
very common ( occurr@@ ence at more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • P@@ ain , nau@@ sea , pain pain , back pain , pain pain , pain in arms and legs • Re@@ duc@@ ts • hyper@@ tension • hyper@@ tension • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in blood • response to the infusion place
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , the pack@@ ag@@ age will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately applied immediately , it is not kept longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C unless the dil@@ ution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions was used .

A@@ lim@@ ta is being applied together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another medicine against cancer ) if the cancer is not re@@ se@@ eable , or spread it easily to other parts of the body , or spreads probably slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients that have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies .
to reduce side effects , patients during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( a vitamin ) and generate inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to prevent or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; anti@@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( phar@@ maceuticals against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid man@@ gel ) .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or during which certain other side effects appear , the treatment should be reduced or reduced or the dosage should be decreased .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ y@@ ken slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed in its active form is easier to out@@ fit than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication and a longer cell duration in cancer cells .
in a study of 456 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients were treated with local and metastatic disease that previously treated with chemotherapy was compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , aver@@ aged 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in general administration of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time in A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients showed that the cancer cell car@@ c@@ iliary epi@@ thel@@ ial cells were observed in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. An authorization for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each hydraulic bottle is dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is extracted and diluted with a 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.6 ) .
in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma except the epi@@ th@@ eli@@ or@@ ital hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in excess - gender sign of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion with infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ emet@@ ry - infusion on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ance of skin actions the day before and on the day of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gabe : and on the day after the treatment was given an anti @-@ ti@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ ry to be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the dosage must be continued during the whole duration of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry dose .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mcg ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose as well as every third case @-@ hand cycle .
in patients who received P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course a dose of dose must be held under Con@@ sider the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood vessels or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of forec@@ asting therapy cycles .
after recovery the patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 must apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria are defined in the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood circulation .
should patients not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient needs to be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient reaches the value before the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled after 2 doses of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ology tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurr@@ ence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies show no note that in patients aged 65 years or over , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an elevated side effect was observed .
in children under 18 years of age , AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ aring of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustment is necessary to go out the recommended dose adjustments for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ aring of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( at ab@@ norm@@ ality of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5.0 fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ asis ) was not studied especially in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the optic line mark@@ er and P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed may not be given to patients before the absolute neut@@ rop@@ aid has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the counter value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ aid numbers , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was noted if a pre@@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ ry treated patients to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 than proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ate measure to reduce risk @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ actic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g per day ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and reducing 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ ry to avoid ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , rep@@ ented risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - the collection in trans@@ om@@ ul@@ arly room can be achieved a drainage of the ergonom@@ ics prior to the P@@ emet@@ ry @-@ treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ ry occasionally , if this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life @-@ gro@@ u@@ els ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ cted ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible short@@ age of re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be referred to in front of treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sts in regard to the sperm mot@@ ions .
in patients with normal kidney function ( kidney disease ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ logistics ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dis@@ position with a result of increasing effects of side effects .
therefore , be careful when in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ aring ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , should be avoided or avoided 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with long half @-@ time settings like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - to be avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the opposition status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance rate of IN@@ R ( International Standards par Ratio ) when the decision was made to handle the patient du@@ cks with oral anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed at pregnant women , but as in case of licence @-@ met@@ abolic diseases are expected to occur severe pain defects .
P@@ emet@@ ry can not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful re@@ consideration of the working for the mother and risk for the disease ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be rejected before the treatment course , consultation with regard to the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vi@@ our .
it is not known if P@@ emet@@ ry over to breast milk and un@@ wanted effects in the nurs@@ ing inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

it is used in overweight adults with a body massage index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie di@@ ets .
patients receiving all@@ i and after 12 weeks can be recorded without weight loss , should consult with their doctor or pharmac@@ ies .
if this enz@@ ym@@ es are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can &apos;t get rid of some fats in food , which accounts for about one quarter of the fats suffering from food .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no allowance could be observed in patients relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are more o@@ blem@@ en on after , fle@@ atus ( winch ) with stud @-@ lab@@ eling , stepped / maneu@@ ver@@ ing , se@@ ven@@ ous secre@@ tion ( wind ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .

it must not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term malt syndrome ( in which no sufficient nutrients are taken from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( an liver disease ) , and with pregnant mothers or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission adopted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited launched a approval for placing the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ ory di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ged diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and teenagers under 18 , as there are not sufficient data regarding efficacy and safety .
however , or@@ list@@ at is only minimal add@@ res@@ or@@ ating , in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .
• Over@@ all @-@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components • Equ@@ al treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • chronic fatigue syndrome • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Premature treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurr@@ ence of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat food .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be achieved with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who consult a drug against diabetes , before the onset of therapy with all@@ i a physician or pharmac@@ ies , because the dose of anti@@ diabet@@ ic may be adapted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol level should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .

both in one study to inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma sens@@ es .
when applying the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick @-@ Values ( internationally standardis@@ ation ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years were treated with levels of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the standard area .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received at the same time or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma monitoring .
animal experiments were no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of medication together because absorption of absorbed fat is avoided .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily .
the numbers are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects , which were detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported of a population un@@ certain size .

single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people without finding significant clinical findings .
in the majority of the cases notified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on humans and animal can be derived from a quick re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ sports properties of or@@ list@@ at .

clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of food fatty acids .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 on the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory li@@ fel@@ ine diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its output weight ( Table 2 ) .
even though both studies were observed the weight reduction over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is used with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the pot@@ ency of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ emet@@ ry ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough .
this means that the active ingredient of an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which have strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ es were no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ es were no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 the European Commission adopted the Company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the placing on the market of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly fluctu@@ ations due to cancer disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rect@@ al passage , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty decre@@ es or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution offered at the same gift of pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extends the Q@@ T interval or patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to increase up to such an extension .
besides , in connection with another chemical therap@@ ist , alo@@ xi should neither be used for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron contained the five evaluated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics activity in five clinical trials ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and an Ste@@ ady concentration called Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ do@@ l , pan@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , ran@@ iti@@ din , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ oc@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is necessary by the doctor &apos;s treat doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least with alo@@ xi in relation to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and fruit sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of su@@ pers@@ ens@@ ability actions and reactions at the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar dosage showed to adverse events such as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose of effectiveness .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis however probably does not require effective therapy at an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind trials , a total of 1.@@ 132 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) , or 100 mg of Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received , which was given day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ thma intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the trial with strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ated chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron matched to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of the pal@@ sy , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron offers the ability to block the I@@ on@@ ary and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ ary channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy subjects carried out the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of the administered pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After the intraven@@ ous application follows an initial decrease in the plasma centre a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal number@@ ing of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the whole dose range of 0.0@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer .
following an intraven@@ ous treatment of pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean interval ( ± SD ) ranged from the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma welding at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ian simul@@ ations indicate that the total exposure of 0.25 mg of pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the following intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was equivalent to 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are elim@@ in@@ ating over the kidneys , and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary metals which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies , the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron used as an un@@ altered active ingredient approx . 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ine injection , the overall physical @-@ body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ aring 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function are increased the terminal elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination and the average system exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , only after ex@@ positions were observed , considered sufficient about the maximum human exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 from pre@@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ary channels and pro@@ mul@@ gated by the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ ity and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose expressed in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposition of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ op@@ hy@@ se , pan@@ cre@@ as , ne@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not with mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of this results will be low as for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the di@@ vin@@ ation of approval for the placing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C has been suggested by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon &#91; is &#93; a biological medic@@ inal product called Ro@@ feron @-@ A , which should be similar to the same general practition@@ er , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference En@@ ter &quot; ) .
alp@@ habet should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a vir@@ al inf@@ ection inhibit@@ or liver disease ) .
in case of a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage indicates , also the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ s al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) has been increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast which was introduced into a gene ( DNA ) which stimul@@ ates these to formation of active substances .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data in the treatment of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition , and purity of medication , effects , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon were compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients .
in the study , how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , any concerns of concerns relating to the stability of the substances and of the market drugs have not been sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after receiving the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease re @-@ retard@@ ant the disease in more patients than in the reference line ; furthermore , Alph@@ eon also had any side effects .
apart from that , in the study the test was used to investigate the question , to what extent is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with pit@@ cher formation of infl@@ ated skin infection ) and small in@@ ted Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or slic@@ ing ) , di@@ modi@@ fying and inclined wounds .
Alt@@ ar@@ go is not to be used for the treatment of infections which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because the alarm against this kind of infections may not work .
Alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied in patients from age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area of treatment must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not dependent on treatment after two to three days , the physician should re@@ examine the patient and draw alternative treatments in consideration .
it affects the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ ces of the effectiveness was in all five studies of patients who received infection after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the total of 139 patients under alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated under placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients were treated with both groups .
however , in these two studies , however , Alt@@ ar@@ go was found in the treatment of wast@@ es ( previously filled cav@@ ity in body tissue ) or of infections which have been det@@ ectable or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with Alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the order .
the benefits for human phar@@ maceuticals ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Alt@@ ar@@ go was over@@ taking over the risks : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ s , fir@@ ing or inclined wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission adopted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the placing on the market of Alt@@ ar@@ go within the European Union .
the patients who have no improvements in two to three days should not be examined once and an alternative solution are considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a broadcast or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is broken up , the oint@@ ment is carefully qu@@ en@@ ched and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection has begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections , where M@@ RSA is known as the path@@ ogen or is assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary operations carried out the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) was in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered as if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvements or deteri@@ oration of the infected passage .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical sources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to its low plasma cent@@ ric control , which have been reached after human skin or detected su@@ perf@@ icial wounds , an clin@@ ically important inhibit@@ ing in vivo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 According to the premature gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment increased from healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure in patients , dose adjustments are not necessary to be required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during an system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
veter@@ inary studies showed a reproduction of re@@ productive medicine after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in reference to the consequences for the birth and s@@ coff@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if an anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic action .
in case of whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Alt@@ ar@@ go continued to termin@@ ate between the benefits of the breast@@ feeding and benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman &apos;s benefit .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin inf@@ ectious disease , Alt@@ ar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the administration site that approximately 1 % of patients were concerned .
action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ al@@ er@@ eri@@ anus ( former Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ al@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction between the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ sec@@ ting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the Bin@@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ der and the Pep@@ tide region and the Pep@@ tide region .

should consider for the reason of the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least a few inf@@ ectious forms , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulin is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ility factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ en@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults was given 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily using oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and obli@@ que skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days in the treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were won .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in case of medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system intake of man according to top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 cm2 due to the skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between the age of 15 and 15 that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two cans of existing vacc@@ inations , with a protection against hepatitis B could only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix only uses when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ inations can be guided at the end of two doses .
if a viewing dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given .
vacc@@ ines can work by using the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; how to wake up against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ination Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult and Twin@@ rix children are administered under one of three cans of existing vacc@@ inations .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult identical ingredients , were some of the data used by the application of Twin@@ rix adults as well as cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibodies .
in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led from between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the recent injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six month and at a 12 month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite , pain ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may react to the active ingredients that react to the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission adopted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y.@@ s.@@ a , a approval for the placing of the market of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the Stand@@ ar@@ ming plan for the footprint of Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a view is used for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccine .
it is still not fully secured whether immun@@ competent individuals who are addressed to an hepatitis A vaccine , since it may also be protected as a protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ologic memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ectors to the rare cases of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , respective possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard dim@@ ms is recommended using the combination sim@@ pler hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .

since an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination , these injection leads should be avoided .
in these cases , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to inj@@ ected , as it may be inj@@ ected to in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular gift in these cases .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of separate injection at the same time with a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , az@@ ul@@ opath@@ ic Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined ground m@@ um@@ my vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly no adequate immun@@ ity is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination units of this formulation in adults was the incidence of pain , ro@@ cking , sw@@ elling , absorption , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the incidence that observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ iness and preserv@@ ative substances .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses are administered in a total of 10@@ 27 im@@ plants , ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged from 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination sim@@ p .
only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and matter on a comp@@ uted basis per vacc@@ ination . Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects following the gift of a 3 @-@ doses combination sim@@ p .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix administered more than pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination sim@@ p .
however , the incidence of matter was comparable per binding ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received ambient temperature , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % for the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination sim@@ pler ) .
the frequency pronounced pain and appreci@@ ation was low and comparable to that it was observed after administration of the combination sim@@ p with the 3 @-@ cans oc@@ in@@ ema .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old impor@@ ters the occurr@@ ence of locations in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to which in administration with the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ pler hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B compound was observed .
however , the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the In@@ jection ) per dose , not per test .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines who reported heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans oc@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B . statistically significant was not different .
in clinical trials that were conducted in im@@ plants at the age of 1 - including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ con@@ rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the rate of con@@ fer@@ encing rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , on the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparable study , which was carried out in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of ambient and 147 received the standard combinations with three doses .
of the 289 people whose immun@@ ity rates were evaluated ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ dose im@@ pregn@@ ation , it was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ity that have been reached in a clinical study study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the end of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or 3 @-@ cans oc@@ in@@ ema with a combination sim@@ pler hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix within the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the anti @-@ vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination sim@@ p , consisting of 360 ELISA units formal@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study on 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al cont@@ amin@@ ot@@ oma and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways like through Baden in the wast@@ ew@@ ater waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark Ur@@ ine , a blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may be necessary for stationary treatment .
like with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protect against infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are / your child in front of the administration of both vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix already infected with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ well or ill ) , an vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections which the liver are ashamed or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• when with you / your child already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or some component of this vaccine is shown including ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by ju@@ ck@@ ing skin supplements , breathing not or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • when with you / your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • when you / your child has severe infection with fever / hat .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the planned administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine , the doctor will give you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix rates .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface treatment .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix of persons suffering from severe bleeding problems under the skin and not in the muscle decreases . • if you are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your own body def@@ ences , or if you / your child moves to a ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is needed .
21 Say you your doctor if you receive / your child more medicines ( including those who have not been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ cription ) or when you have been vacc@@ inated or Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) has been administered , or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against any or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible in different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction will nevertheless be sufficient for the vaccine .
typically , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not administered , except it is ur@@ gently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) once with you / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccine , please contact your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

23 Information your doctor or pharmac@@ ies when one of the listed Side Effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you will notice any side effects that are not included in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data subject since the issu@@ ance of the first approval of the placing on placing on the market , the CH@@ MP , the fact that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient positi@@ vity remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only transferred in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to the low patient exposure .
mon@@ op@@ ulation can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ full du@@ z@@ ine def@@ ective ( Hir@@ n@@ damage to high blood concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
am@@ mon@@ les is divided into several single doses at me@@ al@@ time - se@@ clu@@ ded , mixed or mixed by the abdom@@ inal ceiling ( through the abdom@@ inal wall in the gast@@ ric tube ) or a nose ( through the nose into the stom@@ ping hose ) .
this was not a comparative study , that am@@ mon@@ g did not compare with other treatment or placebo ( an investig@@ ational medicine , i.e. excluding active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ g may also lead to loss of appet@@ ite , depression , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , in@@ curr@@ y body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ ap@@ se in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle must be avoided .
mon@@ op@@ ulation was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients where a full end has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ positive form ( un@@ usually en@@ vir@@ al defect , which manifested itself after the first life month ) , an indication for the application when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial spongiform encephalopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with s@@ u@@ ck@@ ers . AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and for the development and development of the daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early proposed deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ len@@ yn@@ thetics or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an arg@@ in@@ ine uc@@ c@@ ini deficiency must have arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowed dysfunction , as a risk for the emergence of ov@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately coming to the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , equivalent to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe ren@@ al failure , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with care in patients with con@@ genital cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ trac@@ ing and ag@@ onal formation only with caution .
as met@@ abolic and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ cted ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate mon@@ or@@ ate to a high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal im@@ plant@@ ing and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of m@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning of ner@@ ve cells in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ cted during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients were at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of this un@@ wanted events that they had not been combined with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ dis@@ tical patient who developed an met@@ abolic spongiform encephalopath@@ y , heavy hypo@@ cris@@ y , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred within 5 months old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the Ac@@ cum@@ ulation of phenol , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ages of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a met@@ abolic connection , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ ate with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate glut@@ amine using the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally analyzed ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ l@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of absorbed sodium poly@@ ph@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rat is produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine poly@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early mandatory form of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost always near , and the disease led to treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their st@@ ick@@ ener analog computing within the first life year of death .
due to Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative means of nitrogen resistant ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl car@@ nit@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ zo@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate as post @-@ party at post@@ oper@@ al ( but within the first life month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed with pregnancy in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients were treated with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a delayed form of the condition ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes shaped like the or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase defect ) , which were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet was 98 % .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ si@@ bly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neu@@ rolo@@ gic condition may occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , using phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ l@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined after the gift of an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in indirect healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual and repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous treatment of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tra@@ ys form 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able plasma cent@@ ric of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ cycli@@ c awareness or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ opath@@ y was det@@ ectable after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) on the next morning after n@@ igh@@ tly fast@@ ing .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts .
differentiation The drug is di@@ vor@@ ced within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl glut@@ amine on the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after or@@ ally administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can still swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with s@@ u@@ ck@@ ers ) or given to a gast@@ ric acid or a nose .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , Car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ ene protein should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early proposed deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ len@@ yn@@ thetics or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat feder@@ ate was suspended from the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active Met@@ dra lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the Hir@@ n@@ avy .
a more likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ dis@@ tical patient who developed an met@@ abolic spongiform encephalopath@@ y , heavy hypo@@ cris@@ y , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally analyzed ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ l@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the de@@ formation of excess
based on the basis of investigations on the de@@ formation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of absorbed sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine poly@@ amine nitrogen are produced .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are barely reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neu@@ rolo@@ gic state may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able plasma cent@@ ric of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the period of durability , the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to get the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS will be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so they can &apos;t leave the st@@ ick@@ ness of waste products , which cannot be taken after consumption of proteins in the body .
in case of our laboratory testing , you need to tell the doctor that you may use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines . please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if you take other drugs or recently taken it before , even if it is not pres@@ cription drug .
during the shut@@ down time you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since the medicine had to over@@ ride and harm your baby .
in rare cases , there were also confusion , head@@ aches , flav@@ our@@ ies , taste of hearing , des@@ ori@@ enti@@ ity , mem@@ ori@@ entations , and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you are using one of these symptoms , you can immediately place your doctor immediately with your doctor or the emergency number of your hospital for the introduction of an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to forget AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of growing patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood intake to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest pain with different thickness ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac ab@@ normal@@ ities ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measure at the instrument of electro@@ cardi@@ ograph ( EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ goes a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the primary study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of angi@@ ox during sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with a conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ite ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
during the PCI , patients often became a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go one PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients that may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other brain cells or one of the other components .
in addition , it may not be applied to patients who had a blood circulation , as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a replacement for the treatment of ACS and a PCI an acceptable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ intervals ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ E@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency , or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
in case of patients receiving one PCI , an additional bol@@ us should be given at 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical trials , the reduced inf@@ usi@@ an dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a Bol@@ t of 0.5 mg / kg must be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the impact .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous Bol@@ t of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a few Bol@@ us @-@ free gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ t of 0.3 mg / kg body weight is made .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously to the Bol@@ ly dose .
as soon as the ACT amounts for more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly .
for patients with severe kidney restrictions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to one PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in against ACS is treated or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ t dose of 0.3 mg / kg is enough and the ACT re@@ prove once again after the second bolt .
in patients with severe kidney damage , which led to the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustments on average 366 ± 89 seconds .

patients are carefully observed during the treatment with respect to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if using PCI @-@ patients suffering from arter@@ ial @-@ cells , most of the bleeding associated with arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who occur in the treatment principle everywhere .
in patients who use War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should make sure that the value of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Standards par Ratio ) should make sure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in will again be achieved before the treatment level .
starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ate aggreg@@ ate ) can be assumed that these substances are increasing blood .
in combination with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ tic units or anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ o@@ gens , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis are regularly monitored in any case .

both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation group as well as in those treated with H@@ ep@@ arin became women as well as in patients over 65 years more likely to be more common than in male or younger patients .
heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy loads as shown in table 2 .
both light and heavy blo@@ od@@ ations performed significantly less than in the groups with H@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ ochem@@ istry plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , intra@@ ocular or surgical intervention required , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without obvious blood pressure , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a blood of blood , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

the following data on adverse events are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients who under@@ go one PCI .
both in the bi@@ valent group in group as well as in those treated with H@@ ep@@ arin were women and patients more likely to be more common than in male or younger patients over 65 years .
minor hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in both light and severe bleeding occurred less frequently than in the reference group under H@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following adverse events , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive application in practice and are summarized according to system organic classes in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is instantly falling and to monitor the patient at a level of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific thread @-@ bin@@ or , which bin@@ ds both on the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the an@@ ion@@ ic bin@@ ian region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in the case of Ger@@ n@@ mb@@ in .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in has slowly asc@@ end the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients , in which it had come to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ in@@ ized Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , had no thro@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ate reaction .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered it with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not have enough ins@@ ulin to control the gl@@ ucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin can be processed .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs mark@@ edly very slightly from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means it seems faster and a shorter active duration has as a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is in use in combination with a long @-@ stroke ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can not produce an ins@@ ulin , in two trials with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , at which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the modification of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) showed an increase of 0.14 % for ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % of human normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients that may be ens@@ itive to ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin or any of other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is taken together with a number of other medicines that can be extingu@@ ished to the gl@@ ucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH , a approval for the placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdom@@ inal ceiling , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous or sub@@ cut@@ aneous to app@@ liance or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in the area of abdom@@ inal navigation .
due to the reduced gl@@ ucose loading capacity and the lower ins@@ ulin change , the ins@@ ulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
every change of active efficiency , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , interest rate , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ oth ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin should be done under str@@ ingent supervision and may require a change of dosage required .
the point of emergence of a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia is based on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin delivery and can therefore change to change the treatment schem@@ as .
to increase the substances that increase the blood gl@@ ucose activity and increase the inclination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fibro@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ z , sal@@ icy@@ lic and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics .
in addition , amongst the effects of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics , such as temp@@ ting , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and ranks of symptoms of ad@@ mi@@ an anti@@ gens should be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experiments on re@@ productive reductions showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin at the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if there is ins@@ ulin inj@@ ections in human breast milk , but generally , ins@@ ulin occurs neither in breast milk , nor is after or@@ derly use .

li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy Will be missed to change the injection place inside the injection area , can occur in the result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy on the injection centre .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ bodies with consciousness can be given by means of in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ ucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , who is treated by a doctor &apos;s intraven@@ ous administration or intraven@@ ous treatment by a doctor .
after a gl@@ ucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause for the heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating peripheral gl@@ ucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through the inhibit@@ ing of gl@@ ucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that when sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ ol &apos;s ins@@ ulin occurs faster and the effective duration is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ ian normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeutic relevant doses range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , an proportional increase of glu@@ ed glu@@ ing effects , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase of glu@@ eing impact effect , such as Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as rapid active effect as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the complete glu@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
the data was evident that at an application of ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ ran@@ ean glyc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was opened , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control is given to the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for a gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as opposed to human normal ins@@ ulin at 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( figure 1C ) .
