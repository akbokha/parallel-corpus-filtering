<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Financial Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations concerning the application of medication.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information on your disease or treatment, please read the package instructions (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information regarding the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Think thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), missiles and madness; • bipolar-I disturbance, an psychic disorder in which patients have lack of periods (Periods abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abile is used to treat moderate to severe weather episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who spoke in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to fast control of disturbance or behavioural troubles when the oral medication should not be possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can take the solution to remove or the hot tablets in patients, which the swallowing of tablets are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who also take other medicines at the same time, it should be taken as fine-proof, the dose should be adjusted by Abilabilia.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells due to "Neurotrantransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">In particular Aripiprazol probably works as part of "partial Agents" for the receptors for the neurotrantransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions than the neural creitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar failure to normalize the activity of brain, which avoids psychological or lack of symptoms and their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of adsorption that reoccur the symptoms were examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in an experienced disturbance, compared to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abile has over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of ambilical and placebo which re-appear to occur at 160 patients, where the lack of symptoms had been stabilized with Abilabilia.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of ambilical injection solution was observed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, who suffered from Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the symptoms of symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate, such as the body the melting tray and the solution for taking resorating (ascending).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection-solution, patients who received Abillingered in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of disturbance than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar troubleshooting, Abile did in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms most effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abile prevented for up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo this recurrary episodes of previously treated patients and when it was added to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ambilical injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of disturbance and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilty (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (loss of movement), obitution, nausea (severe saliva), obitution, nausea (loss of saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restitution, insomnia (sleep disturbance) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The conclusion that the benefits for human pharmaceuticals (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilophrenia and of medium-severe episodes of patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the lack of human episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol spoke to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution for patients with schizophrenia or patients with lack of bipolar periods in patients with bipolar-I disturbance, when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd company. it has been granted approval for the placing on the market by Abilzio in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of severe weather episodes of bipolar-I- disturbance and prevention of a new manic episode in patients which mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day irrespective of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapist or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients a lower initial dose should be considered, if clinical factors are justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor was removed from combination therapy, the Aripivotal dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The emergence of suicides, psychotic diseases and affective disorders, was reported in some cases after the onset or change of an antimental therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study demonstrated that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated suicides with Aripiprazole in comparison to other non-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should treat patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood-pressure disease) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spetdyskinesia: in clinical trials that followed one year or less, there was occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY patients treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be withdrawn in consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms who have developed on a mns, or without a clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with crampfanes in the Anamnese or in states which are used with campfancases in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Aripiprazol in patients associated with Alzheimer's disease patients had treated patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosing and the response to undesired rovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases an extreme and associated with ketoazia or hyperosmolarcoma or death, was reported in patients suffering from atypical antiotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antibiotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manie due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, which can be observed, or unhealthy life, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, it is careful when Aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other central vertebrates are taken with themselves-stocked side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonis Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant to be clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (China) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore similar dose cuts should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'Poor ") Metabolism the common application can be used with high-level inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher Plasmac centrations of Aripimizole in comparison with CYP2D6 extensively-intensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-level CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, should the potential use of the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, withered similar effects, and therefore should make similar dose cuts.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escuopram (or CYP2D6) can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be counted with a constant increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethotomorphan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethyl).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify your doctor when pregnant or pregnant women during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient amount of data on the safety of humans and due to the concerns of the animal studies in pregnancy, this medicine may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the potential use justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other non-psychotics, the patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study conducted over 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25,8%) of EPS including car insonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study for more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was reduced in patients under Ariadprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients treated with Aripivotal therapy and 15,1% in patients under Olanzee therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manicular episodes at bipolar-I interruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was included in patients under Ariadprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was reduced in patients under Ariadmizole treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Ariadprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups amongst Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters were found, there was no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and common cerptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivotal patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Related to these events, which may occur in connection with an antimental therapy, the malignant neurolegenesis, Spätdyskinesis, and Krampfancases, unwanted infamcular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since its market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdossifications were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Though there are no information on the effectiveness of an overdosage with Aripiprazole. it is unlikely that Hemodialysis is used in the treatment of an overdose of benefits because Aripiprazole has a high plasma detector.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors is mediated on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrene and to histamine-H1recipe.</seg>
<seg id="76">With a gift of Aripiprazol at doses of 0.5 upto 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the posthumb emissions reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptors, at Nucleus caudatus and on the turkey.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 Shizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripivotal showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-controlled study, 52 the proportion of respondents in response to the study was observed in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from brass cells defined as secondary school courses, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressrates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate that was 34% in the Aripivotal group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a transcapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study at Schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients were observed in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with more flexible dose of 3 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reduction of manic symptoms more than 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapytrial with 3 weeks having fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance showed Aripiprazol to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a lack of bipolar or mixed detective, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and an effect effect that was comparable with the lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 a similar proportion of patients suffering from symptomatic remission of the manie to be similar to lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks of patients with a lack of bipolar-I disturbance, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol yielded an overlegenic efficacy in reducing manic symptoms in comparison to monotherapies with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks before Randomization, Aripiprazol showed superior to placebo superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly with the prevention of a feedback.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion of Aripiprazol and the N-deciphation is dialyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminution life time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'Poor ") Metabolzation via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics revealed no evidence to clinically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazole and dehydration-dehydrates were similar in patients with severe kidney failure. compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose-study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to attract scarfs on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spelling, toxicity with repeated treatment, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canogens potential no particular hazards in humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only when dosages or exposure positions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects recorded a dossional side loss of peripheral toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymary) occurs at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 mg / kg / day) (10times the middle-ady Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholesterol is determined as a result of the yield of sulphate-conjugate of Aripiprazol into the Gall of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (i.e. 1- up to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations observed at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazole not more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions in the 3 and 11times the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical minimum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a anti-microtubic substance that promotes the storage of micro-rotubes from the Tubullimeren and stabilizes the microtubuli by inhibiting its deolysmerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vitale interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the Transcytosis of plasma agents in the endothelial cells and has been demonstrated in the framework of in vitro studies that the presence of albumin transports the transport of Paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendotheliale transportation through gp-60-Albuminrecomor is conveyed through a Paclitaxel accumulation in cysteine) due to the albuminaire protein PARC (cted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>

<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced tumors, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Paclitaxel have been compared to intravenous 30 minutes after an infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared with a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) as after a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized in the first line to 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolic (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean concentration of cumulative total dose was less than 1% of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolic syndrome and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="369">Abseamed became in administration as injection into a vein in the framework of a major study of 479 patients who suffered in kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All of the patients participating Eprex / Erypo in a vein was injected at least eight weeks before they were either umamed up or received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Basic indices for the effectiveness was the variation of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of the skin speculated by the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study conducted with patients suffering from kidney problems, the hemoglobin values were observed in the same dimensions as in those of those who received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anämiesymptome and folds may vary depending on age, gender, and disease-load; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and sickness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in the hemoglobs by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobbins can be observed occasionally or under the hemoglobbin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability should be tried to achieve the same dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value exceeds more than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dosage is 25% to reduce.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epetin alfa in the lowest legal dose which is required to control the anemia and anovesymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb-value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher efficiency boxes in which the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epetin alfa are in the lowest legal dose which is required to control the anovesymptome.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dL (0.62 mmol / l) or the retina dose to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be kept at 150 i.e. / kg three times per week or 450 i.e. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobster rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the retinitis increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times per week.</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epochs, if the hemoglobbconcentation is higher when monitoring blood transfusions and avoiding blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobster rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dL (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident coronent heart disease, sufficiency should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin targets under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present knowledge, the treatment of anemia with epochal insufficiency in adults is insufficiently charged with kidney failure that are not dialysis on failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">For the evaluation of therapy in tumour patients, a 2-3-week delay between epic-alfa gift and the Erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients, which may be transfished).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), must minimize the risk for possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapyunconditional anemia - Dosage between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dL).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of combinant Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction under participation of the respective patient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic procedure, if possible, at the beginning of the epoch in-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be treated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo to an extra-effective orthodontic procedure should have a reasonable risk for thrombotic and vascular diseases, particularly with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epetin alfa for patients with a starting point value of &gt; 13 g / s an increased risk for postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can be established.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can not be used alone (monotherapies) in patients (especially overweight patients). • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be adjusted with Metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylrescence or insulin, the existing dose of Sulfonyllyms or insulin may be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced by the dose of Sulfonyllyms or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized and the blood glucose level sinks, reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin using a sulfonyllative, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glycerated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actuals led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which allows blood glucose levels when applying doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplea study, the effect of the additional treatment of action to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphuylrescence in a decrease in HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional gift from placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who participated in addition to insulin took a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% compared to 6 months, compared with 0.14% in those patients.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were seduced disorders, infections of the upper airways (cold), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity opposite Reizen).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actuals may not react to patients either in patients with liver problems, heart failure, heart failure or diabetic Ketoazia (high point level - acidity - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that action within a monotherapy (at all use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with Metformin in patients should not appear on which Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission adopted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the placing of Actos in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient and incompatibility due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For patients under 18 years of age, Pioglitazone is not available for patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or eye-insufficiency, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and an eye-insufficiency when Pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular disease was carried out with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macular disease.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in response to cardiac insufficiency, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymvalues (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of the liver disease Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient have developed symptoms which indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, rebuild holes, tiredness, appetite and / or dark Harn, are the liver enzymatic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to whether the treatment in patients with Pioglitazon should be directed until the prescriptions of the laboratory parameters can be directed by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dossional weight gain was detected that by fat deposits, and in some cases are connected to a liquid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of the treatment, Pioglitazone introduced a minor reduction of medium-sized hemoglobin (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed during similar studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobbye by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity, patients who received Pioglycitazone as oral dual - or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dossiest hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, ThiazolidIndicils, including Pioglitazon, was reported on a emergence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between taking Pioglycitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but the possibility of a macular edema should be aware of if patients may be considered to be considered as a degree of ophthalmologic studies.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of notification of undesirable events in this randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients were treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 Fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglycitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the trial study, a study conducted more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular diseases, questionnaires at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with pioglycitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes you a pregnancy or enter it, the treatment is given (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies in interaction of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacology of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medication which are metabolized by this enzyme, e.g. oral contradiction, Cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-Reductors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the Council (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a lowering of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, in pregnancy, hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistant to the parent's disease and thus decreasing the availability of metabolic rate.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100; often &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turf and the core index of the lens, as well as other hypoglycaemic substances are observed.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstents came across than threefold between the upper limit of the standard area, commonly referred to as under Placebo, but less than in comparison groups below Metformin or Sulfonyllstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with existing advanced macular disease the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has been reported to be insufficiency with Pioglycitazone, but more frequently, when Pioglitazone was in combination with insulin failure in the Anamnese in combination with insulin failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">An summarizing analysis of notification of undesirable events in this randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazone, and more than 7,400 patients were treated with reference-mediation groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of running Proactive trial, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day more than seven days showed no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work via a activation of specific kernel receptors (PPAR-γ)) which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, grease and skeletal muskeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glcosevers in case of insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after onset of therapy, a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be performed by Pioglitazone at 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study more than 12 months, patients who received blood sugar despite insulin-insuffice, were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c - value decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who received just insulin at the patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotiations compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapies with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small cell examination on type 2 diabetes mics in a small group of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as marginally higher LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years Pioglitazone reduced Pioglycitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatic glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased its HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to Plazoglitazone, there was no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol, while under metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study on 20 weeks Pioglitazone did not only reduce the navy triglyceride, but also improved the postprance increased triglyceride level, this also improved through a effect on the Triglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatic Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular disease, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular disease were randomized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentation to the unaltered Pioglitazone, generally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to efficacy in about the three times of the efficacy of Pioglycitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone could no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacology of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with a P450 2C8 inhibitor is increased or by Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) or reduces the plasma centre of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to the active application of radioactive markised pioglycitazon in humans the marker was mainly found in the spring (55%) and to a lower extent in the resin (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The medium plasma elimination of plasma-Elimination of unaltered Pioglitazone amounts to men 5-6 hours, while the total active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centric of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects, but resemble the rates of oral detergance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and evil monkeys, after repeated administration, Plasmavolume enlargement with hematlution, anemia and reversibler exfoliated heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduced the hyperurinary inemia and increased insulin-resistant insulin resistance and thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for rubella growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">Long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary injection epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosmotic therapy and treatment of transplants are familiar to this medicine or make changes in immunosressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplants or to an increased incidence of side effects, including substitution or overimmunity.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients always should maintain the same tacklus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regimes should only be carried out under the narrow control of one in the transplantation by experienced medicine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of an alternative to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dosages must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dose of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of harpouring and tolerability in detail and on blood-level rules (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After upgrading from Prograf to Advagraf the Tacrolimus-Talar should be controlled from the changeover and over two weeks after migration.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposition was measured as a bottom level, with both formulations both with kidney disease and lebertransplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus-Talar level are recommended for the first two weeks after transplantation by us agraf to ensure an appropriate substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, can take a change of the agraf-Dosisschemas several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow the disease treatment intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate on the manufacture of infusion pump) may be redirected at a dose of approx. 5 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application to the suppression of graft reactions must be observed; consistent, therefore, a maximum duration of oral treatment cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dietary recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of the grafts of graft therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Additional dosages can be later necessary since the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dietary recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of the grafts of graft therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage - conversion by Prograf at Advagraf you need a transplant of daily dosage of Prograf capsules at a time daily dosage at a daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the whole daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a transition from other immune soup to Advagraf every day the treatment with the oral starting dose for the prophylaxis of the graft spherical dose begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">The heart transplant for adult patients who participate in Advagraf is a oral starting dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplants are no clinical experience with Advagraf in pneumonia, pancreas and infectious patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplant in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bluttings in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function a heralate of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function since the kidney function has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum cancer is recommended, a calculation of cancatininating and monitoring of urinary volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In the transition from a Ciclospore - based on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the bottom level in full blood. the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of harpouring and tolerability in single cases under subsidy Tacrolimus-Talrolimus-Talar inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls from the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talbot from Tacrolimus should also follow the conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosisadjustments, changes to immunosressive therapy, or with the benefit of substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Piagraf is a drug with a low clearing, the dose may require several days, until the Steady State occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials can close that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the bottom level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley level of Tacrolimus usually lies in the first time after liver transplantations usually within the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with indued patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent retention of liver, kidney and cardiac transplants were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus Under- or Overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients always should maintain the same tacklus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regimes should only be carried out under the narrow control of one in the transplantation by experienced medicine (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5. for the treatment of growing patients with grafts, which proved to be more immune to other immunodeficiency, there are still no clinical data for the retaining formulation of the formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">The prophylaxis of the transplant grafts in adult heart grafts and transplants in childhood are still no clinical data for the retaining formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interaction which can lead to a reduction of Tacroclimate mirror in the blood and a weakening of Tacrolimus, the intake of vegetable preparations (hypericum penetrating) is contained, or other plant sound during a treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacroclimate concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood level can be subject to fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases under Prograf could be seen as a kardiomyopathy, aqueous or septumhypertrophy, which is thus possible at Calagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference, a treatment with corrosion resistance, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid overload and ovulation.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immune lressants the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of skin by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protective factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus symptoms of pres like headaches, changing corneal state, cramps and vision, should be a radiographic examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous application of medicines or plant extracts, which are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, may increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing blood values from Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It therefore advisable to monitor the tactic level of blood levels in the same gift of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolism and to set the tacklash dose for maintaining more consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the enhanced oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal contamination, resulted in.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dosiated prednisolone or methylprednisolon, as it is used for acute divorous reactions, may increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect from Tacrolimus on metabolism of other medicinal worsenus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with drugs can be metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus will come down the clearing of steroid-contradiction, and thus increase the hormones, is particularly careful in decisions of receiving diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and their half-life.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application can be applied later to whether Advocates are applied for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII-lack, causing bleeding problems like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA":</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available, the CHMP has continued to have the benefit-risk provisions on the basis of which the safety profile has been closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">The CHMP has therefore been based on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation procedure should apply another renewal process in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited adopted the Committee on Human Medicines (CHMP), that the company intends to withdraw his application for the placing on the market from Mr. Li's Cancer Organisation for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, the genetically modified that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so that there are no copies of itself and therefore no infections be dissolving in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advanced in would have been injected directly into the tumours and allow to reduce the cancer cells to form a normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made out of the non-defectives in the human body existing p53 gene, is usually caused to restore damaged DNA and to kill cells when the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and split up.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study of a study involving the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of subbuilding, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answer of the company on the questions asked, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initially submitted documents the CHMP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company by the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of the Advocin in Li-Fraumeni tumours are given advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medicines in the body, the type of administration as well as security of medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way, and that neither the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company, the CHMP, was not aware of it if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently involved in clinical trials or "Compassionate use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed action-release" means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is slowly released over a couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergienitis (hayloft, caused by an allergy to pollen inflammation of the nose) in patients with nasal mucous membranes (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of AerInaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken all with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated immediately when the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (crumbs nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effectiveness of the severity of the severity of the hayloft was reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients treated their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When consideration all the hastating of the nose notes, the patients reported to the incongestation of the nose, with Aerinplant's revenues, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients receiving Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a decrease of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of AerInaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are achometer, dizziness, dizziness, mental pain, redness, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somolence (sleepless), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">AerinBox may not be applied to patients who may insulin-insulated (allergic) against desloratadin, Pseudoephedrin, or one of the other components, against admittent active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinet can also be used in patients treated with a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart disease (hypertension), hyperthyroose (hypertension), hyperthyroose (hypertension), or already had a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a hemorrhage) or have a risk for a hemorrhagic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence for placing Aerinaze's placing sites in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is it all to swallow (i.e. without them too hard to break down or cut down).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to the absence of data for inference and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after cling the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days because when long-term application the activity of Puridoephedrin is able to take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline of the mucous membranes of the mucous membranes in the upper breathing, treatment with desloratile can be continued as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Da Aerinet Pseudoephedrin, the medicine is also contracted in patients who are treated with a monoaminotase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetical activity with other vasoconstricin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabotoline, dichloride, dihydrogenotamine, phenylephrine, Ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective, and the data do not suffice to expose appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerobatics were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data are not enough to arrange adequate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or a tachykaryarm or tachykarycardiovascular disease, nausea or etwaigen of other neurological symptoms (like headaches or reinforcement of headaches) must be canceled.</seg>

<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were added in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma centric of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychosol tests no significant differences between the treated patients were detected, regardless of whether desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not identified yet so that interactions with other drugs can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the pharmaceuticals CYP2D6 cannot inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The insolvency of the application of Aerinfestation during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since realising studies of animals not always be transferred to humans and on the basis of vasoconstrious characteristics of Pseudoephedrin should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impairment or ability to control machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, minded mental attention, cyanaesthesia, coma, cardiovascular collation) and a ZNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treading, convection) with possible leases.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile, as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the electoral P-selection of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In case of a single dose-study, desloratadin 5 mg not showed an influence on standard measurement sizes of flight output including reinforcement subjectors or tasks that are linked to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at recommended dose of 5 mg, no increased frequency of slanness in comparison to placebo was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage may cause more sympathomimetical effects such as an increase of blood pressure, a speedometer system or manifestations of a CNS.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamantagonist efficacy of aerobatic tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptom (except nasal mucosine swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapist with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobatics tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosine swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapist with desloratadin via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose-study on pharmacokinetics of Aeriningrad, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flowing weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrin on day 10 was reached.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetics multi-dossier, which was conducted with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four subjects were desloratadin poorly disputed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-interaction study indicates that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin is severe in exposure to the treatment of an aerobatic tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety spelling, toxicity within a repetitive gift, for rebootoxicity and reproduction, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did no longer toxicity as their individual components, and the observed effects were generally in connection with the content Pseudoephedrin.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials for seasonal allergies and two trials in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of pain, impairment of sleep and the performance of the days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body provides the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melting tray in the same way as the tablets and use in children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In an allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptompoints) by 25 to 32%, compared to a decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in urticaria the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius cannot be applied in patients that may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1733">Clinical-relevant interaction were not found in the framework of clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were added in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmaceuticals study, amerius and alcohol is not amplified the performance effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified in this respect, in very rare cases, it can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impairment or ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius were reported in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events which were more common than in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth-dried (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and were treated with placebo in 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study at which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (ninetric clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile, as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the frasionism P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple sockets, administered in desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninety-fold of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dossier study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg not showed an influence on standard measurement sizes of flight output including reinforcement subjectors or tasks that are linked to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in the relief of symptoms such as niotic, nose secretion and itching in the nose, Juckreiz, the inflow of the eyes and Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As indicated by the total score of the questionnaire for the life quality at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden of seasonal allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria, representing the underlying Pathophysiology, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the geneology similar to the different shapes and can be recruited by chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a factor of a factor of all urtikarial diseases is expected that Desloratadin is also associated with other forms of the urticaria in an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in the improvement of prisuritus and the reduction of size and number of tortures at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies, with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority in patients who did not respond to antihistamines, was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching up more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergienitis in 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no applications for clinical relevant cumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5-20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not yet identified, so that interactions with other drugs will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies that the medicine CYP2D6 cannot inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetal, calorie rich breakfast) does not provide the availability of Desloratadadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials performed by desloratadin and Loratadin demonstrated in a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicate fils of desloratadin and of Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety spelling, toxicity with repeated treatment, genotoxicity and reproductive reductions let the preclinical data of desloratadin do not recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are pre-treated that support a treatment of an infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, we should play an role in diagnosis the anamnese, physical examinations, and skin analyses.</seg>
<seg id="1766">For example, about 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabusing desloratadine and experienced a higher subtle load (see under Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years of age, partly metabolizes, is identical to those with children who metabolize normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with inherent problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-Galactose absorption or a sucrose isomisite insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinical-relevant interaction were not found in the framework of clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, taking of amerius tablets and alcohol is not amplified the performance effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total effects of the adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirus Group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In an extra-dose study of adults and adolescents, who were given up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times of clinical dose) no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were treated for anti-histaminated therapy received a daily deslords of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar to extrapolate the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg was used daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study in adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninety-fold of clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of drowsiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets produced in adults and adolescents in clinical studies in no impairment of the Psychoscalory.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmaceuticals in adults, alcohol was not impaired by an increase of alcohol or to increase the alcohol-induced performance decreases to an increase in slanness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius tablets became effective in the relief of symptoms such as Nibese, nose secretion and Juckreiz's nose, juckreiz, triumption of the eyes and Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">How the total percentage of questionnaires at Rhino-conjunctivitis was shown, reducing Aerius tablets effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in the improvement of prisuritus and the reduction of size and number of tortures at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully autometabolic phenotyps was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters have been observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with Sirupformulations between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are partly metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) caused by desloratadine was after 3 to 6 hours approximately 6 times higher and the Cmax 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no reference points for an clinically relevant active substance cumulation according to a daily application of desloratadin (5 - 20 mg) over 14 days for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In different single dose studies, AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadin showed that the recommended doses are comparable with those of adults who received desloratadin-Sirup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not yet identified, so that interactions with other drugs can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1790">Aerius Sirup is offered in type III Braunglascylinders with child-safe polypropylene-end cap with 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 150, 225 and 300 ml.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against influenza, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine, which may cause a trunk of influenza rimp, which may cause a future Pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of Grippavirus is diverted, which is easily locked by man to man, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine system, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus and forms the antibody against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a Grippevirus of this mamms fast antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes surface, detects the human body as body alien) and is used as a component of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This means that the scope of clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine is not enough to meet the requirements of the EMEA for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which infected with the human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-1), which caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules, the genase can be used as a solution for inserting, but these can not be taken together with Ritonavir because safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be classified if the doctor has been checked, which has an antiviral medicine of the patient before, and the likelihood has made that the virus may appeal to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is governed by body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to cure AIDS, but can do the damage of the immune system, so that the development of AIDS related infections and diseases can do.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was tested in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had been treated with protease inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This Ritonavir reinforced medicinal drug was compared with low protease inhibitor, compared with other protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Basic indices for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (virusload) or the change of virusload after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had not taken no protease inhibitor, they had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but amgenase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also had the viral load, but of the children who had been treated with protease inhibiting, only very few of the treatment said.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated with protease inhibitors, the virusload increased after 16-weeks treatment as well as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came under the genase with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of virusload after four weeks as in the patient receiving their previous prototypes:</seg>
<seg id="1918">Most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue strength (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Amblown cavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also not be applied with patients, the currant (a plant preparation for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are the same as Agenase, and in high concentrations in the blood of health are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">Like other medicines for HIV in patients who take Agenase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteodeficiency (extinction of bone tissue) or immunodeficiency syndromes (symptoms of infection that will cause prolonged immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Medicines (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of treated HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is generally taken together with the pharmacokinetetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee pointed out that the benefits of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously no protease inhibitor is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally licensed under "extraordinary circumstances, since the approval of scientific reasons only had limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission adopted Glaxo Group Limited approved a approval for the placing of Agenase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 certified, protease inhibitor (PI) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic Boobs of Ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambvir should be done under consideration of the individual viral resistance of the patients and the pretreatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambbavir as a solution for inserting is 14% less than by Ambavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligrams per milligrams base is not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for tease capsules is 600 mg ambvir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. when Agenerase capsules can be applied without the amplification of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses must be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for axial capsules is 20 mg amblown / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambvir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety of amgenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibiting were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the absence of data for inference and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application is intended to be used in patients with mild or even liver function when patients with severe liver function is contracted in patients with severe liver function (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and display substrates of the P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable choices, which contain curiskraut (hypericum penetrating) may not be applied due to the risk of the plasma centric and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambbavir during taking Ambbavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy should not lead to a cure of HIV infection, and that they can still develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase prevents the risk of a transfer of HIV to others due to sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">The genase capsules are usually used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver turbulence with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unborn agastase is based on two uncontrolled studies with 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase Solution was examined twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-condensed Ritonavir given at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) who received ARTIs together with Agenase.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambbavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Amblown up 12 hours after the dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) impacted by food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approx. 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be moved to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered Penetration of Amblown up from the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the plasma in plasma, with the amount of unbound Amblown cavir, which remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unledblown up remains constant, the percentage of free active components were fluctuation during the dosing intervals in the Steady state in the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals, or inhibitions or inhibitions or inhibitions or the substrate of CYP3A4 must be given to caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Amblown exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambvir is made of the solution 14% less bipolar than from the capsules; therefore, Agenase Solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on one millionth basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible, so the impact of a renal disturbance is likely to be minimal due to the elimination of Ambvir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ambbavir plasma levels similar to those who achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambvir twice daily without concurrent administration of Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the pharmacies was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (by reducing its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Althirazyme the GAG concentrations in the urine um increased by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal liver on the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Most common adverse events of Althirazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin cancer (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat and fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachykarat (accelerated heart rate), fever and Schütt.</seg>

<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammalian Cell Culture (Chinese Hamster OO, Eating floor of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Althazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of Mucysaccharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Althazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary concombatant diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h may be increased when the patient increases this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Althirazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no metering scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Althazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Althirazyme patients can develop infusioned reactions which are defined as each in connection, which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored again, and the infusion of Althirazyme should only be done within a reasonable clinical environment, in which resorating equipment for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 clinical trial, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusioned reaction must be treated with caution of Althazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because little experience is pre-established after treatment after a longer break, must be careful due to the theoretical increased risk of a sensitive reaction reaction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or anti-detachka) to minimize the potential appearance of infusioned reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or moderate infant-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be treated and / or a reduction of infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate when the response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of single, heavy infant-related reaction, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, a treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / isbuprofen.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Althirazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or procain because a potential risk of interferencing involving intracellular recording of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Pet experimental studies do not allow to direct or indirect effects of the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data to newborns, which were exponated across laronidase across the breast milk, is recommended to non-quiet during the treatment with Althirazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions were included in clinical trials which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Althirazyme who were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently used in the following table according to the following table names: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the history, severe reactions were also represented, including Bronobuds, breathing and visual fields (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesirable medicines in connection with Althirazyme, who were reported in a phase 2 study with 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe distribution form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg IV ously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients appeared within 3 months after the treatment of a seropic version, whereas in the age of 5 years with severe expeditions usually occurred within one month to a serene version (average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature excrete from the study) there were no antibody being provable in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients who never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low risk levels found a robust reduction in the GAG spiegels in Harn, while in patients with high anti-antibodies, a variable reduction of GAG in Harn was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal propensity to a low neutral inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of undesirable pharmaceutical-actions, even when the occurrence of unwanted drugs reactions were typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzyme therapy is located in a subjection of the cumulative Substrate and the preventing another accumulation of sufficient stimulation of final activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the blood and cells into Lysosomes, the most likely learn about Manners-6-Phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Althazyme were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were randomised to recruit the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients showed the mean phenotype and only one patient demonstrated the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Althirazyme every week (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients were treated with Althazyme patients compared to the placebo group a improvement of lung function and the ability to be displayed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining that effects of up to 208 weeks in the Althazyme / Althazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Althazyme group, as shown from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not significant over this period of clinically and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportional to the height-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a therapeutic index of treatment reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decline of GAG mirrors were detected in the Harn (µg / mg creatinine) who remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease-manifestation between the patients receiving by using a combined final point, one range in 6-minute walk test, movement range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity) was generally a improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 9 patients (20%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study carried out primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of Althirazyme in 20 patients were examined at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe wasting form and 4 with the middle screw type).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Several patients showed a higher percentage growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form, whereas in the older patients with severe expiry form only limited or not yet to determine progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study tests on pharmacology effects of various Aldurazyme metering schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg IV ously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The metering scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be seen in patients who have difficulty with weekly Infusions, but it is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information, which will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people without finding significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of the cases notified after the launch of orlistat-overdose, no side effects or similar side effects were reported in the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on humans and animal can be derived from a quick reformation of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the lipassports properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect relies in the lumen of Magens and the upper fertilization by kovalent binder to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and Pancreatic Lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orlistat was taken three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of food fatty acids.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 on the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypocalory lifeline diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the baseline value (at the time of the Randomization), has been rated as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as percentage of those participants that have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of its output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Even though both studies were observed the weight reduction over 12 months, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (starting value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="2542">The average change of the waist circumference was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (starting point 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma controlled orlistat was not measured 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">Generally the metabolic dosages in plasma was not only sporadic in plasma and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients, which was administered at least systemically resorated dose, namely, M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 according to the N-Formyl leucine group) could be identified containing almost 42% of the total plaseccentric.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used with chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The potency of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient of an chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three major studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which have strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with aloes were no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloes were no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005 the European Commission adopted the Company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the placing on the market of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly fluctuations due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding one before the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can extend the colorectal passage, patients with anamnesty decrees or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution offered at the same gift of palletosetron with medicines that extends the QT interval or patients with which the QT- interval is extended or tend to increase up to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides, in connection with another chemical therapist, aloxi should neither be used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron contained the five evaluated chemotherapeutics activity in five clinical trials (Cisplatin, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and an Steady concentration called Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetics analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxidol, panoperidol, paroxetin, ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinocin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is necessary by the doctor's treat doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe effects (a total of 633 patients) who were at least with aloxi in relation to headaches (9%) and fruit stipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of supersensability actions and reactions at the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar dosage showed to adverse events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis however probably does not require effective therapy at an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind trials, a total of 1.132 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2, cyclophosphamide (half-time 4 hours), or 100 mg of Dolassetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received, which was given day 1 without dexamethasthma intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palletosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the trial with strongly emetogenated chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron matched to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of the palsy, Palonosetron offers the ability to block the Ionary and Repolarisation of the Ionary channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy subjects carried out the assessment of the ECG effects of the administered palletosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After the intravenous application follows an initial decrease in the plasma centre a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal numbering of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma centric (Cmax) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in the whole dose range of 0.03- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following an intravenous treatment of palletosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean interval (± SD) ranged from the Palonosetron plasma welding at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetian simulations indicate that the total exposure of 0.25 mg of palletosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the following intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was equivalent to 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminating over the kidneys, and about another 50% will be converted into two primary metals which have less than 1% of the antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies, the CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 CYP1A2 and CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, are involved in Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron used as an unaltered active ingredient approx. 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous Bolusine injection, the overall physical-body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function are increased the terminal elimination of elimination and the average system exposure with Palonosetron, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, only after expositions were observed, considered sufficient about the maximum human exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 from preclinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionary channels and promulgated by the ventricular Deity and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose expressed in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposition of humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in a higher frequency of liver tumors, endoophyse, pancreas, nenierenmark) and skin tumours in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but because of the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended for one-time application, the relevance of this results will be low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of wastes (previously filled cavity in body tissue) or of infections which have been detectable or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The benefits for human pharmaceuticals (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo was overtaking over the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirs, firing or inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission adopted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing on the market of Altargo within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients who have no improvements in two to three days should not be examined once and an alternative solution are considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a broadcast or severe local Irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is broken up, the ointment is carefully quenched and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections, where MRSA is known as the pathogen or is assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary operations carried out the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections which caused by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered as if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvements or deterioration of the infected passage.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical sources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma centric control, which have been reached after human skin or detected superficial wounds, an clinically important inhibiting in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the premature gift of 2-times daily 200 mg of Ketoconazole, the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment increased from healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure in patients, dose adjustments are not necessary to be required if topical Retapamulin is applied during an systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Veterinary studies showed a reproduction of reproductive medicine after oral ingestion and are inadequate in reference to the consequences for the birth and scoffal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if an antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic action.</seg>

<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infectious disease, Altargo was the most frequently reported side effects of Irritation at the administration site that approximately 1% of patients were concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passealererianus (former Pleurotus passealanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction between the bacterial Ribosomes, which differs from the bonds of other ribosomal intersecting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Binribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the ribosomal P-Binder and the Peptide region and the Peptide region.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binding place hemmed Pandroutiline to block the peptidyltransfer, block partly P-connective interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should consider for the reason of the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Retapamulin at least a few infectious forms, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulin is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-appealing to the treatment in S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virility factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leuencidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults was given 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily using occlusion on intact and oblique skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days in the treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in case of medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system intake of man according to topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 due to the skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between the age of 15 and 15 that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two cans of existing vaccinations, with a protection against hepatitis B could only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix only uses when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccinations can be guided at the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a viewing dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines can work by using the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "how to wake up against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccination Twinrix Adults and the vaccination of Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix Adult and Twinrix children are administered under one of three cans of existing vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adult identical ingredients, were some of the data used by the application of Twinrix adults as well as cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indices for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led from between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the recent injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar at a six month and at a 12 month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, appetite, pain (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may react to the active ingredients that react to the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission adopted GlaxoSmithKline Biology.s.a, a approval for the placing of the market of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standarming plan for the footprint of Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a view is used for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the respective monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is still not fully secured whether immuncompetent individuals who are addressed to an hepatitis A vaccine, since it may also be protected as a protection, as they may also be protected by immunologic memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injectors to the rare cases of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, respective possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard dimms is recommended using the combination simpler hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">When hemalysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system is achieved according to the footprint of an adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS Anti-HBS Anti-HBS Anti-HBS Anti-HBS Anti-HBS Anti-HBS antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccination, these injection leads should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, Ambirix is injected to injected, as it may be injected to intramuscular gift in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of separate injection at the same time with a combined Diphtheri-, azulopathic Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelia vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined ground mummy vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients suffering from immunosressive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly no adequate immunity is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination units of this formulation in adults was the incidence of pain, rocking, swelling, absorption, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the incidence that observed in previous thiomeriness and preservative substances.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses are administered in a total of 1027 implants, ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged from 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination simp.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher Frequencies of pain and matter on a computed basis per vaccination. Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects following the gift of a 3-doses combination simp.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle 66,4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix administered more than pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose-combination simp.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of matter was comparable per binding (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received ambient temperature, compared with 36.2% for the subjects who received the 3-doses combination simpler).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency pronounced pain and appreciation was low and comparable to that it was observed after administration of the combination simp with the 3-cans ocinema.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old importers the occurrence of locations in the Ambirixgroup comparable to which in administration with the 3-cans combination simpler hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B compound was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, the 6- to 11- year-olds was reported after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the Injection) per dose, not per test.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines who reported heavy side effects during the 2-cans ocininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B. statistically significant was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were conducted in implants at the age of 1 - including 15 years, the seroconrates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The rate of conferencing rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, on the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparable study, which was carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of ambient and 147 received the standard combinations with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">Of the 289 people whose immunity rates were evaluated (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3-dose impregnation, it was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunity that have been reached in a clinical study study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-cans vaccination with Ambirix or 3-cans ocinema with a combination simpler hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix within the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to the anti-vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simp, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study on 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies is comparable to the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given at the same time with the reimetry of a combined Diphtheri-, tetanus-, aculopathic Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelia-vaccination (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined ground mummumps of vaccination, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation was performed in adults, showed the current formulation of similar seroprotances and seroppression rates such as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that each gram of absorbed sodium polyphybutyrat is produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylamine polyamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early mandatory form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly almost always near, and the disease led to treatment with Peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stickener analog computing within the first life year of death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to Hemodialysis, the utilisation of alternative means of nitrogen resistant (sodium polyphenyl carnitate), proteinzoate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate as post-party at postoperal (but within the first life month) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of growing patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood intake to the heart), for example in unstable Angina (a form of pain in chest pain with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (cardiac abnormalities) (an anomalous measure at the instrument of electrocardiograph (ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergoes a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the primary study on the treatment of ACS, where the effect of angiox during sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with a conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulite) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often became a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure) and they received additional medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo one PCI, angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied in patients that may be insensitive (allergic) against bivalirudin, other brain cells or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">In addition, it may not be applied to patients who had a blood circulation, as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Medicines (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is a replacement for the treatment of ACS and a PCI an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued the Medicines Company UK Ltd. approval for the placing on the market of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromen (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebintervals) (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency, or when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">In case of patients receiving one PCI, an additional bolus should be given at 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical trials, the reduced infusian dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a Bolt of 0.5 mg / kg must be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the impact.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous Bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a few Bolus-free gift of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second Bolt of 0.3 mg / kg body weight is made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed and administered intravenously intravenously to the Bolly dose.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts for more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">For patients with severe kidney restrictions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to one PCI (whether with bivalerudin against ACS is treated or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second Bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is enough and the ACT reprove once again after the second bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage, which led to the III- PCI study (Replace-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the bivalerudin-Bolus without dose adjustments on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In cases of severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients are intoxicable (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be redirected 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous administration of infracised Heparin or 8 hours after the termination of the subcutaneous gift of a molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other components or against miludine bleeding. • heavier hypertension or infant bacterial endocitis. • heavier kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully observed during the treatment with respect to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalerudin is administered in combination with another anti-agululans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if using PCI-patients suffering from arterial-cells, most of the bleeding associated with arterial points can occur in patients who occur in the treatment principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who use Warfarin and treated with bivalirudin should make sure that the value of the INR-value (International Standards par Ratio) should make sure that the value of the treatment with bivalerudin will again be achieved before the treatment level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of the anti-agulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocytic aggregate aggregate) can be assumed that these substances are increasing blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with thrombozytic units or anti-agulogens, clinical and biological hemostasis are regularly monitored in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalent group in group as well as in those treated with Heparin were women and patients more likely to be more common than in male or younger patients over 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Minor hemorrhages in both light and severe bleeding occurred less frequently than in the reference group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following adverse events, which are not listed above, have been reported after extensive application in practice and are summarized according to system organic classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with bivalirudin is instantly falling and to monitor the patient at a level of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thread-binor, which binds both on the catalytic centre as well as at the anionic binian region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or in the case of Gernmbin.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin has slowly ascend the binding of bivalirudin-arg3-Pro4, thereby generates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalerudin with serum of patients, in which it had come to heparininized Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), had no throcytes aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, bivalerudine shows a dossional and concentric intoxicity, which is assigned by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patients underwent a PCI level, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg bivalerudin should be given to 1.75mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>

<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adapted if it is taken together with a number of other medicines that can be extinguished to the glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, a approval for the placing on the market of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is either a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling, or subcutaneous or subcutaneous to appliance or subcutaneous in the area of abdominal navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose loading capacity and the lower insulin change, the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Every change of active efficiency, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, interest rate, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or termination of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazioth; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin or insulin should be done under stringent supervision and may require a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The point of emergence of a hypoglycemia is based on the active profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change to change the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To increase the substances that increase the blood glucose activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramide, fibrooxetine, monoamin-oxidant (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyz, salicylic and sulfonamid antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, amongst the effects of sympatholytics, such as tempting, Clonidine, Guanethidin and ranks of symptoms of admian antigens should be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive reductions showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin at the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if there is insulin injections in human breast milk, but generally, insulin occurs neither in breast milk, nor is after orderly use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the incidence of clinical trials listed below, grouped after system organic classes and: ≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000.</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold Welding, cool, and blending skin, fatigue, nervousness or treble, anxiety, unusual weakness, concentration disorders, torment, excessive interest, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to change the injection place inside the injection area, can occur in the result of a lipodystrophy on the injection centre.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycembodies with consciousness can be given by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), who is treated by a doctor's intravenous administration or intravenous treatment by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause for the heavy hypoglycemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as through the inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that when subcutaneous Gol's insulin occurs faster and the effective duration is shorter than hu- manian normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insinglulisin in therapeutic relevant doses range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, an proportional increase of glued gluing effects, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, a proportional increase of glueing impact effect, such as Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insinglulisin has twice as rapid active effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete gluing effect about 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that at an application of insulin pulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post-ranean glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insinglulisisin 2 minutes before meal was opened, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insinglulisin is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given to the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insinglulisin for a gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as opposed to human normal insulin at 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) was given before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insinglulisin for a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
