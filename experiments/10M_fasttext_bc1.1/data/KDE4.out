to use the crash module , click on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; click on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of stor@@ ze , if available .
the module suction filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s a current job directory on different kind of fil@@ tering .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , use ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the just shown website . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root note .
the module &amp; Desktop ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further list for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the speci@@ fic@@ ity of &amp; fs@@ b ; exists to depic@@ t folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is illustrated by a rectangle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum of the sizes of the attached objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
when looking for &amp; fs@@ b , the size of a file or folder is , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the items in it . in this way , large files can be easily detected , if it can be easily detected in the folder hier@@ archy , it can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be viewed .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; a record in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation is a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . for sim@@ pler navigation the rec@@ tan@@ gles have reasonable colour and labelling .
the colour of a rectangle that is switched on display colour mode , can either display depth for the easy detection of the sh@@ orts or figure of another file as name , propriet@@ or , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle may be lab@@ eled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can specify if enough space is displayed , or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate right angle should be displayed , then you can define the relative position of the inscription on the rectangle below .
with the algorith@@ ms for tre@@ ads , the area should be kept proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always observed , and this frame is not always available anymore . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square .
as a distribution of a single entry for the assigned entries , the implementation remains . here , it is possible for the label and avoid@@ ance of space due to space whenever possible , the right are as possible . the best methods are related to lines , columns or rec@@ tional evaluation .
you can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu entry . instead , a room sample is drawn up in the area of the superior entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera feature is available to you with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly into &amp; digi@@ e ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library @-@ Disk 2 . of course every medium and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ os ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to evaluate your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the processing can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ os came ; easy to use , it is complete professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC @-@ color spo@@ iling workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . this means it is to support the support of the end time . you should therefore notify problems and improved information .
&amp; digi@@ os ; attempts to make use of problems or suggestions , as easy as possible for them . whenever you are interested in the program , your web browser opens a page in error report . all the required information are already registered here . follow just the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ous is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , if you have a regular user from &amp; digi@@ os , we would like to answer any questions on other users of &amp; digi@@ os ; and hop@@ efully we wish to answer any questions about other users . in this ma@@ iling list , however , you should know how this language should be powerful .
you can also check the digi@@ plug ; homepage to learn news about the given versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ os ; the registration in the developer ma@@ iling list . instructions for the registration in the developer ma@@ iling list of &amp; digi@@ os came ; .
when you arrive and digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked to store your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or removable folder , or click on the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains identical for all image folders .
later you can also add many files as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ os r@@ amps , you will also use as al@@ locate library . digi@@ plug must be found in addition .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images contains , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ os ; viewed every sub@@ folder as a album . no picture will be changed . while supporting the folder you get a progress indicator of how to see :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; could take recur@@ sively the Biblioth@@ ek@@ sp@@ ad in its whole depth . you can &apos;t make any sub @-@ folders , unless it box in hidden folders . you can add an extraordinary &amp; digi@@ ous file ; do not allow you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ title .
if you have a existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ches do not have photos as symbols . you can change the albums by using any picture from the album and this is then used as Alb@@ um@@ icon . more details will be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can setup your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use my albums and my sample box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it ; possibly do you need to figure out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help shell support .
how to setup and work with raw files in sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Properties and Ro@@ h procedure are described .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera feature is available to you with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly into &amp; digi@@ e ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library @-@ Disk 2 . of course every medium and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ os ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed a constantly common protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to host and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are slowly connected to the serial port , this connection is now fold . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports this cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ nier 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is required to read the preview images . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 , you may not have any tools possible , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to digi@@ plug and digi@@ ous is , just as easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Project ( manual ) is a joint approach for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ m@@ g. and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules of all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually every way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; check it ; by writing a small module to complement one function , when the changes came to &amp; digi@@ o ; even perform .
in order to simpli@@ fy the windows , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and drop of pictures works everywhere : you can attach a picture in another section of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , via the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , dat@@ ac@@ list , or search .
- a file selection allows you to figure out : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bars . so the fil@@ tering works on the file name only if this ind the symbolic screen . what fields can be displayed in the dialog box settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view of your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single alb@@ um@@ baum , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ features or after the date , where the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed to the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also sc@@ anned a picture directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shots directly to an album . select an album Im@@ por@@ ting screen photo .

Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums to select under a common name . the collection is used to select your photos if you want to add or delete albums by collection . if you want to add new collections or delete , you can also make it possible to collections for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums after date with View albums After date .
the buttons of the oldest , average , latest : these are the date of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this is first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this is missing , the date of last change every file is used in this file .
if you first came first album in &amp; digi@@ ous , the first picture in the album as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; mine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; . sometimes , this is the first photo in the album aren &apos;t representative and you may want to select another picture as a symbol .
in order to select another photo as an album icon , you must select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ er@@ ev@@ en@@ quot ; select . in addition , you can select the picture on the album in the list , to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be fin@@ ed .
&amp; digi@@ os ; supports the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album . you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window presents you the main screen of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can custom@@ ize the size of this preview with the two l@@ up@@ ils in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time you have to wait for short while the preview images will be generated . this allows you to create a new look at the menu Tools menu .
information about each picture will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information here are , you can change over the digi@@ plug ; select here the albums page and custom@@ ize the area forward images your wishes .
the preview images have Help windows allowing us . if you can rest the mouse over a moment on a picture . the help shows the main features including all the tags of a photos . the screen photograph shows in the section introduction into the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all the images added to &amp; digi@@ os ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your pictures and allows you to reach the menu menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the viewing of the pictures , a slide or the editing of the pictures .

you should note that after processing of other image processing programs with problems associated with the met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs are not capable of storing the changing image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , sheet etc .
&amp; digi@@ os ; pos@@ es two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way to click with the right mouse button on the preview and to select . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file names of a photos , select with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc . ) .
when you get a photo from &amp; digi@@ al ; delete , it is delayed in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; delayed . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer really hard , you can use it by using Shift ; Ent@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My date sli@@ ders ; organizes your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the dates below , so that only the photos of the selected days are shown .
photos with key@@ word provide a flexible and powerful possibility to organize and catalog@@ ed your photos . tags include st@@ ic@@ kers , individual photos or all groups can be assigned . once a key@@ word is assigned to a picture , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again .

&amp; digi@@ os was characterized ; character@@ izing any image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . these enables images to compare these signatures . depending on the difference between two image signatures , the more they are applied . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is a range in which you can drop every picture to find a similar one . if you move a picture of somewhere on the symbol of un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then you will open it and you can leave it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand paint roller : draw a quick drawing and digi@@ plug ; finds the matching pictures . also here , a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . you can push it on your left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course going to contain your image of G@@ eo data .
in the bottom below you can specify a name for your G@@ eo filter . this is then added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live encoder .
&amp; digi@@ os ; introduces a light table in a separate window available with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also shell files .
choose one or more images from any view at the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open his window . if you come back on &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window can be opened quickly with L ex@@ tras .
from the front bar you can see the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right range of the window and see there . a small arrow indicates that copy of the tool@@ bar can select and then switch the zoo from the tool@@ bar and then you will see them in the other picture . you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to view from a picture series . if you want to navigate a pair of images from the tool@@ bar , then use the left mouse button on any screen to view it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures .
naturally , the normal soldering actions are also working directly from the light table as such as F4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pre @-@ looking images in light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function which you can easily see the visible arrows . in order to bend the visible area of the picture , you must click here and see the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area in the mode .
zoom is just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike to zo@@ oming in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in mode preview .
what is a digital evaluation copy - away from the fashion to the final issue and the permanent storage , each of the photos taken up until the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos can carry a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips for you to back up , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedures for digital photograph@@ ers who use &amp; digi@@ ous . we consider the download , ren@@ aming , evaluate , evaluate , storing , etc , waiting , and expor@@ ting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management occupies , inde@@ xed , categorized , sec@@ ts , trans@@ forms , consume and exported content that have a month or cultural value .
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data that will provide information on or documentation of other data provided by a application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ ous . if you do not want to store the met@@ ad@@ ata both in a database as well as in the image files , you will definitely be able to access with other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first thing you do and want to know anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you &apos;ll need to move sometime to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly beyond your disk . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you will then use a folder for images that can be printed or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % working files will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . split new files from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
we also recommend met@@ ad@@ ata option to use the met@@ ad@@ ata of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ ous . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can also select the met@@ ad@@ ata of the database by clicking the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what would like to change ? it will be introducing a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks . these are of course the most important .
now begin the real work , as you can now select every photo words , let@@ tering and an evaluation . you can start all the images that the same attri@@ bute require and then put the value . this makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now use key@@ words , keywords , as you do with other programs often , or categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
when you impor@@ ting cat@@ alog@@ ised images from another source with built @-@ in sampling , then the images will be applied to the correct spot . the sub@@ sor@@ ting of Hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving images from &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while under the sub @-@ trees .
the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata su@@ ede . this is a very rough representation , because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are all pictures .
enough of the stit@@ ching - the next section rel@@ ates to record or comments using your met@@ ad@@ ata .
most often don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from afar off is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , space .
and now I tell you that this is the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may have even changed the perception of this panoramic view completely .
for other those of your photos look , the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to viewer , to help Him about the motive that moves you to understand what you understand .
it is okay if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength just with a label for themselves alone .
with &amp; digi@@ als ; you can also save a lot of text , in an inter@@ national@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . if you can export your images in Web @-@ galleries , these f@@ ters will be exported to your wishes into the label and / or title of the web @-@ gallery system . you need to tell us about the story this second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? good , because with pictures the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ al@@ ise are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be even deeper into the future . I am sure to open your travel virtually through pictures with geographical data . you can also download the photos at the recording location . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export images to Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . with Google Maps Maps .

the following description tells you what information is explained in the information page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should be your name , or name of the person who created the photo . if it is not w@@ ished , the name of the photographer can be used , then the name of a company or organization is used . after that this value , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support c@@ mas nor semi @-@ commerci@@ ally as a separ@@ ator .
car rental ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : associ@@ ating with the author . examples of this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , free photographer or independent photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the authority field , this must be filled in as well .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld , to identify the photo . this must not be the author . if the photographer has to be listed here . if the image is shown here . if the image is a storage photo , then the group / Agency will be displayed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright issues , though this is no protection against mis@@ use . each of which is a little more than basic met@@ ad@@ ata , can er@@ ase or change this problem . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . digi@@ al &amp; digi@@ os was delivered ; there will be a module for stack@@ ing processing in the near future .
topics : record error , record fail@@ ures , EC@@ C , transmission error , age@@ ing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ iring , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we can &apos;t tell about CDs that went on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section is concerned about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery in the world , has several interesting statistics that causes data loss .
in order to fight the problem of CDs / DVDs , you must not have more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe this is in your meas@@ ur@@ able game .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are using good dis@@ ks and good capture devices and are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it turns the right to select .
CDs and DVDs are very event@@ ful for error , even if you just have written down . therefore , use a control program to protect themselves . 75 % of data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection he needed them through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called I@@ so B@@ uster &apos;s apparent miracle of CDs and DVDs . it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that can also read damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to be able to win the HD DVD &apos;s format . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ player DVD with 8.5 GB . of course everything about CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn the media with a good start to qualit@@ atively high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author keywords and then to a clean , dark dry and in @-@ proof place . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of media before you can read this media or software that can read this media .
dis@@ course manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ sem@@ ination
soon : discs are the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. For lower temperature conditions , the most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not notice these errors . some of SM@@ ART can termin@@ ate the im@@ pending di@@ arr@@ he@@ a . this is especially readers and publisher . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have the loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses could be re@@ produced without much problems .
while most electric devices are not a lot of power , these devices can take heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these devices can cause severe damage , complete data loss , hard@@ war@@ age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a portion of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually contained in the form of a plug @-@ strip . remember that it does not contain any over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a particular minimum of protection . you should also consider that it protects against ligh@@ tening strikes and protects the right connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should also make sure that all peripheral devices can be connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems , which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable modems and TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these tools are developed specifically for not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , they are ideal for travelling .
while protecting your system protects your system from smaller variations in the electricity lines it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of ir@@ replac@@ eable data . it can therefore be meaning@@ fully into a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can automatically save battery energy and the system automatically runs until the current run . if you get a UPS , you should make sure that they get the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and contrast with the costs to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider as good your computer is used . at the end you should think all the cable before you enter into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service provides S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can save for any quantities of your data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a poor solution but it is no general safety solution . however , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will get more available to you , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory what should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data backup are the web solutions very safe . transmission errors will automatically be automatically adjusted according to the TCP protocol and with the major firms , such a backup and a partial memory are available .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transmission ratios are due for transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least ensure the integrity of the operating system and hard drive .
the worst is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought to have it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data away as the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you &apos;re not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle on low level and can be sc@@ aled . it is open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ . file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protective mechanism used for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses related to not@@ ebook and 46 % at work systems . in case of not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of viruses . it causes a minor damage , such as The@@ ft or Neu@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know quite a few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; however , no one has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English items can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and a defin@@ able status is avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human bugs are the main causes for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ tures from fundam@@ ent@@ ally physical limits . is that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
current cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els Sensors . even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not get any other for data loss . thus , secure your data frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something dangerous like the new installation of your operating system , replacing boards or size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then a day , a flash be@@ ats you luck if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster be@@ ats locally too and destroyed a lot . forget plane in@@ crimin@@ als : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the whole house .
hence , Des@@ per@@ ing is still a no local store . bring your stairs up to the neighbour , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said is a common reason for data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete f@@ use : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without hist@@ ories and provides a complete copy at a time .
difference : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generate a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete securing point and the last differential securing .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status to any time restore . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system in the next with the exception that it is just retri@@ eved and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily create on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens if you want to raise safety over ss@@ h .
save important pictures after you are saved on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this procedure lets you have enough time to get losses and restore again . at the same time , you get a complete final version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly Mom@@ ent@@ ail for at least one month and a Mom@@ ent@@ ail for every month . each further dil@@ ution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the picture file stored IP@@ TC information , affili@@ ated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , vision equipment , ... , use of the internet .
with this valuable pictures that can survive the next 40 years , there is about the time span in which you really interested in you because they are remin@@ ded of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies That should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , everything is said to be careful with caution and rest@@ oring the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask how the current system is back@@ wards compatible . if less variations you have used in the past , it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is presently available for everyone . so , if you have an old system , so you can read and install it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you can change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay at Open Standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure to change a system in its size . actually , it is always enlarge .
let us assume that you have the scal@@ ability with the scal@@ ability and the area where you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . on * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and leave it on a new plate :
check the d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was recognized by the system , but do not hang it on .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; LT ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; LT ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no longer software that can be read , then you can create them . this task is made easier by year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . they should therefore no longer use it .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is less loss , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative many administration information , but not as many as TIFF and requires a slow compression . this format is recommended to save your pictures .
TIFF was widespread as picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is however , that this format has been adapted to many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the hardware / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon even sometime .
this is one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to include the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be allowed to create their data in a file itself . the file information will be stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archi@@ ved in the raw format , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file and how above you can imagine the raw format . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that support for completely compatible Online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which includes a large range of applications and business models . on the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and expl@@ aining efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures of the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and store them in your raw view . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer machining , you can use external programs . if you return the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut by the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in section adding 1 photos to an album , you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for impor@@ ting pictures to your album charts .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the computer switches on the display mode and switch it . a further description can be found on the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , this one tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a distance indicator of all photos on the camera is displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about any entry . using the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog displays file features and the photo information that are internally stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that for some digital cameras not all information are available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS and the image . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ os ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is downloading and then downloading all photos . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ os ; . when downloading , photos are not deleted in an album before you want to delete photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option options from &amp; k@@ de ; select the photos selected , use the button to download and then selected selected . the button selection is download@@ able until you have selected some photos .
when your camera supports this , is an option New download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ os ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you download the buttons all over or selected from selected , a dialog appears where you can select the target album where photos are sorted . details on the folder you can read in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; accessed . loads photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the photos downloaded , you can er@@ ase them from the camera , by removing the button Del@@ ete . if you want to delete just a few , you need to select this first and delete it reset .
note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should be carefully checked in the tr@@ ash@@ tray ; if you have been downloaded from the camera . if you want to er@@ ase the camera , you should make it more quickly over the camera , since it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially meaning@@ ful names . if the photos are deleted from the camera , this may be meaning@@ ful if you have photos of different recording series into the same album . therefore , it can be meaning@@ ful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for dates . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concern the data about the author in Section standard Aut@@ ori@@ dent@@ ity . if you choose this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the EX@@ IF data . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded photos .
if you wish to wish to use another date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % H : % M : % S . turn the option dates and time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ en@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower@@ case or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ os ; for a photo is used , is below the name displayed in the preview of the camera . their settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the next time .
&amp; digi@@ ous , can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the timing . not all cameras can use this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is switched on , and if your camera does not supplies this information , &amp; digi@@ ous is the photo in the original orientation . if you off the automatic turning off , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date of what the photo was made , it can be taken &amp; digi@@ ous . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same album . not all cameras can be loaded into the same album . in the section side@@ bar Meta Data , you can read which information might be embedded into the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ ous records . if you want to change this option , you will need to switch off this option . use the directory based sub @-@ based floors at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer is the button to download . then select upload files . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file containing the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; fix@@ tures , you &apos;d say where the images should be loaded up . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that the data can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and the data can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be executed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to connect a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses an aircraft to attach an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural office and estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open the area with one click . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous , users want to loc@@ alize the place of the photos therefore , it is good to specify the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for manual allocation ( manual ) and last@@ ly on manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has an GPS unit . but there is a few which work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be used with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extract data from images and GPS and cor@@ relate . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the number of coordinates to be created e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ a .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ os was trying to give you how much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings , which you have to copy the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous , you need to copy on these settings . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
this can be found on embedded preview or start @-@ up preview . to order the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ os ; fixed when you click an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ act and copyright data . these data are automatically selected into the appropriate IP@@ TC data . this data is written for downloading from the camera point . also in case of data base fl@@ as@@ yn@@ chron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
car rental is a syn@@ onym for writer : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be used as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if this picture is listed here as the picture of the other &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ an@@ quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ . this is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently supplied in the image and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and they can be imported without going .
photo descriptions of the embedded label formats ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images rendered in images . attention : with pictures that already contain label , these notes are over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ plug ;
the page settings includes all the options for the information displayed if the mouse poin@@ ter rests on a file . according to the selected option , this information is indicated or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and digi@@ versions . to define which file types &amp; digi@@ os r@@ mp , you can add file extensions to this list and remove any file in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no one of these extensions , was igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ ous ;
the default settings can be set back once , by pressing the button on the right of any category .
the settings of the indicator of &amp; digi@@ os r@@ amps can be set on this page . always if you want to open the light table . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have a single computer . if you have one , then you can obtain better viewing results .
by default , image processing use a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can use the tool bar if you use the images at full screen mode .
over@@ exposed and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors can be specified here . in the photo processing this purpose @-@ mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub @-@ sampling , the images should be encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation .
with the setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not need the image quality as PNG need a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF files you can de@@ compression the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is less free .
with the setting loss free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save the loss between quality loss and file size much better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ al , the image processing was only one picture viewer for photos . currently it develops rapidly to a tool for man@@ ipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the photo processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at od@@ d . if you use this option , this is a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the image with a minimum of soft , elim@@ in@@ ating the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic paint balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white ab@@ balance is not set . default it is a fixed color balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white map which was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect of the second sensors has more details in the side@@ ways . for other cameras this option will be igno@@ red .
the default is the peak , so the parts of your images are introduced to view the edge of your camera as passing away . use some unusual results because they are displayed in various ros@@ es . most recently , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the edge .
this is possible because blue pixel are not as quick filling as green and red . &amp; d@@ c@@ w are trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not less blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you re@@ build the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for every picture .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the Standard 1 . however , this may also be done later in the images of the &amp; digi@@ al . this can also be done later in order to keep time for dem@@ os@@ a@@ ing .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ tone algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete picture from the particle data that provides many cameras and that a matrix @-@ colour pixel is available . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ als ; and D@@ cra@@ b provide you three alternatives to you : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorith@@ mic on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour temperature of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening , because you are done while the raw conversion is performed .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and provides instructions such as these should be given . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information like the colour information of a color space to translate into the other are the colors as exactly as possible .
behavior Update if an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
colour profile folder S@@ ign up the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ Color / ICC , where you all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ os / ICC can be examined and explo@@ red during the start of the start .
the ICC @-@ Profile you have the option to deposit &amp; quot ; standard solution to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the blank file .
the color management system is an alternative compared to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ Ã ¤ . here , only your pictures will not manage the whole screen .
the input profiles should be to the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which no d@@ t@@ onal mapping or G@@ amm@@ ar correction . currently correc@@ ts d@@ c@@ w Gamma is not used for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to carry out the d@@ t@@ onal mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your printer can print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be satisfied . this could adjust manually , rather than to leave your printer on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for them for what is intended . unfortunately , this is not suitable for the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon Profile expansion lets you know the style of the design : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image evaluations and image processing . by using this interface can support &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules support written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these modules will be loaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and furthermore , you will find some also in the context menu of the menu .
short @-@ commands for tasks that are done by modules can be fixed in the menu under Settings short command line .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org with the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the images that are usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes then switch the met@@ ad@@ ata a or off which ends at the bottom end of the images during the ad .
the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left @-@ hand side . if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is connected properly and displayed in picture display mode . currently , serial ports , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage cache from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / display , specify your camera .
in order to run your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera with your computer to set it into the display mode .
check out whether &amp; digi@@ plug , the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any description for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option dialog for shi@@ fting &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and del@@ etion of a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can hold tac@@ itly with@@ al &amp; digi@@ al ; if you use the option changes to the right side bar without hes@@ itation . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also attach the display of the training screen of &amp; digi@@ al . it accelerates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ os in the way .
the setting where new photos are looking for &amp; digi@@ os ; the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos would look for . this extends the start time from &amp; digi@@ os ; when something from the base file has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; they want it to delete it out of the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; fix@@ ings ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested , create a new design for &amp; digi@@ os ; you will find more information about this tutorial in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ os ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be launched by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the entry menu of the entry menu entry / editing .
the photo processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ os ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in section image processing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most common features .
the processing functions of the photo processing change your photos . however , no the functions will change the original photo , before you save the Save or the button saving from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , once you have saved the picture .
so you should open a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ produce or push button the button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have been carried out in the photo since the last store .
almost any promotion of the image processing can be re@@ produced or restored , and the last action can re@@ boot automatically by select editing , edit or re@@ produced from the menu .
if you are using this , you should select the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to re@@ produce and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can choose a minute or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also re@@ produced or restored .
once you have started the photo processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture , or the entries in the menu file . if you want changes to the current photo , you will ask if you want to save these .
you can use the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ ep@@ id menu .
to custom@@ ize a picture to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want to change it from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; check out the panel dialog . check the section for setting up the photo processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select in the menu file image and receive the standard &amp; k@@ de ; compression dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can select individual pictures or complete sets . all image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you have to select only the pictures with the standard methods . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug came ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images are available , without the navigation use , also available in the photo processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar or disappear in the edge .
in the labelling view you can enter or insert the inscription below . this text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data will only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and if you want to use special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you &apos;ve commented it , you will either use the button to use or change to the next image , the label are then stored .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can always read the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . this is always done if you have a met@@ ad@@ ata setting which is always written into the pictures .
the section Review shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars at the side@@ bar . to rate several pictures at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC site . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box to the fil@@ tering of the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously shown in this &amp; digi@@ al ; meeting applied .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search phr@@ ase . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is an additional relief for the input of keywords in a picture @-@ series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the key@@ word sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - date , key@@ word and search results are used . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two pass@@ words are available .
you can also drag and cut off . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply go out from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog appears that you &apos;re asking if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected on one key@@ words , indicating the quantity to three images . they were drawn up with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then put a key@@ word from the right key@@ word to the selection and put it down there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be disabled on different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry where in the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already placed in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search via all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you will need to use only the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options below are as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve used it mainly &amp; digi@@ ous ; s worked concrete implementation .
the reason why you set a color @-@ off workflow is that the colours indicated by your camera or scanners are a predic@@ table deviation from the fact that your color on your monitor or scanners are the same and the colors that you can print or publish in the web out of your digital dark@@ rooms .
if the topic is on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons has to express for the results that would like . unfortunately this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make sure your own inform@@ al decisions to make your own informative decisions to make you the desired results .
if your image work@@ flows all six below the criteria must be performed , then you don &apos;t need to worry about color management .
they are calibr@@ ated on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image are by e @-@ mail or web , where it is the RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if it works so well and makes life for all so easy , why should one use another color space so you should make thought about color damage ng ?
a visual example of the limitation of RGB in comparison to the colours which we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors which we can see , the hu@@ spring @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , check out Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms side and click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to al@@ locate my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB space space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not you have to connect your monitor in the RGB space . if you are in the color space of s@@ RGB , you need either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB @-@ standard k@@ alli@@ g@@ um , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it therefore before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ t , automatic and contrast , expand from the menu correct Automatic correction to automatically make your colours the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects , to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is sc@@ aled by the whole picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its shades . this function is often a magical correction for images that be dark or balanced .
the same method is adjusted the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram &apos;s range is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in the improvement of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which causes either mar@@ vel at a picture or destro@@ ys it .
the same method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue @-@ channel . it determines the dark and bright bound@@ aries and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue @-@ duc@@ ts for the complete hist@@ ories .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by changing the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ re@@ generation of all values between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ plug was taken ; is a semi automated tool to perform the white ab@@ t of a photos .
the white ab@@ ell correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can see how far from the original picture you can perform areas with over@@ exposure time . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , your possibilities for correction shall fail better .
this tool is based on a white waste algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ astic . they start the text entry colors white ab@@ using the image processing .
the preview window can be adapted to the size . on the left side are adapted to both the original picture as well as the preview of the target images . the preview is dynam@@ ically correct the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish , it is enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target pictures has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed , once you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very beneficial when most pixel is very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with a button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your earnings depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows are adjustable , you can improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim@@ ms down .
by clicking on the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then use somewhere in the image preview for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of white image . on this type , the temperature and green values will be set automatically .
additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the exposed aggreg@@ ate indicators will increase the colors if more than a colour version of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this is shown in the preview of a pure indicator and does not have the effect on the final image .
the kno@@ bs Save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of white ab@@ uses that you have set to save in a text file and later re@@ load .
the button default settings will return all filter values to their standard values and the associated neutral white image . note that even neutral settings can be specified as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the co@@ di@@ ers per color channel of the engine@@ ered picture . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the wide spread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding requires even more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue such as the processing of raw images . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used for using color profiles .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust and allow you to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is useful if your camera or your scanner can always do the same error and you always need to use the same correction . in the manual for the key correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under the gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provides you four color effects , a solar radiation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ ile filter available .
in times of chemical processing was solar ec@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was developed by a partly developed printing a short flash , and afterwards the development of the image has been inver@@ ted the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors by the second lighting . this tool was a partial neg@@ atives of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is . another increase is finally a negative image that is not able to create on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the treatment ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a saturation guarantee that it makes a stronger contra@@ ction effect , that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simply , it &apos;s emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the name of the brand name for daylight and high contrast liner . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . this is a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers strongly saturated colors with daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , Vel@@ vi@@ as powerful saturated colors are also some photograph@@ ers , especially those who are scar@@ cely negoti@@ ate , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting . the level level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images , the filter can over@@ load the entire CPU for one moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ usually that you want to correct the color paste and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . once you can look at your check in preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in bad light conditions , you can also get a good choice for brightness / saturation . once in this case , it is a good choice for saturation instead of increasing them . all changes they can perform in preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes to O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ ness / contrast / Gamma is the tool range correction to improve the exposure of exposure . even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three shi@@ fter below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of the intensity , an hist@@ ogram , active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graphics are three shi@@ fts to change , the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is the controller to move , and make sure the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the picture , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ met@@ ic Y axis is commonly used . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , this log@@ arith@@ mic release is useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark sounds , the average for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two controllers can be used in order to evaluate the output values as well as the input values can be used for example , creating a hat@@ ched picture as background , while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set to the intensity of the picture .
save as and charging : with these buttons , the set values in the file system are stored and re@@ loaded later . additionally , Gim@@ p levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shade , means and sun tou@@ ches . activate the color icons to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ant channels .
the option of over@@ exposed pixels controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and give you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in preview and it is no effect in the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue canal of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated on your settings . on the right hand the following options are available :
modifications channel : this select box allows you to specify the channel specified by the module :
besides this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ met@@ ic view . especially the linear mode is the sen@@ su@@ al mode . in this case , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode is further improved .
if you move a short vent@@ ures to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ ded with dark sayings and the associated image pixels dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see . if you want this mark on the area you want to change the original score . create a point on this line and move it down , down to the value to your taste is adjusted .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve which you can generate and re@@ loaded in the file system and later , the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three d@@ pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and Sundays . activate the d@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed pixels controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in L@@ umin@@ ance . shadow and sun screen was used with the d@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ plug is a tool to enhance the colour channels , or modify the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly advanced tool to mix the colour shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own hor@@ semen .
the preview of the destination has a red mark@@ er . when you positioning it in a picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to view the respective colour value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and build it allow you to keep the general brightness as well as you can also keep the option of Mon@@ och@@ rome , because the channel mixer is then designed for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from colour@@ ing . colour@@ ing doesn &apos;t occur at the same place in color channel and whose rough@@ s can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion into which you need to reduce the colour@@ ing first .
the storage as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer attitude allows you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposed pixels controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and give you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in preview and it is no effect in the final result .
below , you can see a photo in which the blue canal is re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
black / W photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , because colour pictures can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with one orange lens filters . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air pictures . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a red line filter . this creates dramatic power effects and can simul@@ ate moon fruit to day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with an yellow lens filters . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) white filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones throughout it . this is very similar to the process of a print and re @-@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
apply to the digi@@ plug ; use of the texture . apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can look like oil painting on a canvas , the bul@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry . applying the image processing can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increase the depth of the depth and the dimensional stability of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect was applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief is set to 200 .
a decorative frame can be added to the digi@@ ous frame , add a decorative frame to add a picture .
to keep the eye of an viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task . an opportunity to keep its attention is to put an decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the picture processing .
type : using this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . it is coated with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , it is ideal for a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this can be bigger than the original target picture will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text in an image at any place . this is also possible to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use the text box , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its characteristics as you need . you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
any setting that you chose for your text can be changed , until you push the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture was saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
apply templates with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; add a template on a picture .
the menu template apply template in the photo processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you have to add the PNG file format and want to add a copy of the file size of the sten@@ cil , so you simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ os ; ma@@ iling list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool for first time , you need to put your templates with the button Base folder in the dialog . choose the folder where you will copy the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be made for the next start .
after the root file has been set for templates , a function view that reflects the file structure of the template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically the preview bar of the template .
below the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increases the lower picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button shr@@ inks the box below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to add the template onto the whole picture , check the picture corresponding to the left mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
apply OK when you want to apply templates onto your image . the image will then automatically adapt the template size .
&amp; digi@@ ous was available ; three different tools are available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ p@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ ins p@@ ics .
im@@ pet@@ us mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ p@@ ics . indeed , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
Re@@ focused is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised pictures require a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution to form a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more later than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures , JPEG pictures are frequently used with internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the rough format must always be tigh@@ tened in the processing process .
some scanners apply a shar@@ p@@ ant filter during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing work shar@@ pen . you can correct the edge of the menu entry .
you should deal with this , because the results do not affect the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise level . generally , you will find further information about the menu entry . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to correct the image is much easier than it . use the tool to correct soft@@ ly and experim@@ enting with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays you the effect on your photo .
the filter im@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help the image . the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate good results and should try out first . an increase in the radius or amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the im@@ pet@@ us mask to strong , spoil the noise and the impression of gr@@ as close by sharp edges .
the radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore show images best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ant picture added to the original . thereby the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a break out of the maximum RGB values and the difference to difference . it is possible to define a minimum difference in order to be applied to an edge of the filter . this way the areas can be prevented with a soft shift between the tones of shar@@ pen and therefore Beauty error in s@@ ails , an@@ cho@@ vies and water@@ surfaces .
this is an example of the uns@@ ur@@ red filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . not sharp m@@ asked with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the digi@@ plug was focused on the tool , focused on an image by improvement of the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to see a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ fo@@ kus@@ hima quot ; in which it uses a technique named F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ess mask . Re@@ fo@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist usually gets better results than uns@@ ur@@ m@@ asked . it can start from the menu by pressing colors Re@@ fo@@ cus@@ sion@@ ing in image processing .
in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ge of the folding . the Gau@@ ß has a very long tail , which leads far from the original qu@@ it@@ pixel , which is far influenced from the original qu@@ it@@ pixel , which is affected by most cases even very strong from the remote pixels . this caused un@@ wanted results .
circular depth : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameters for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very sharp but then on the sound of the sound .
correlation : an increase of correlation can help save arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ ply effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase of the rob@@ ber@@ y can help you to reduce Ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only . if the noise filter is very poor , the image quality is very poor . a high value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still not sm@@ earing the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ fact . if you have a value equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . if you choose large values for the circular flow or the G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . note that the module may be very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity modification on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module , before you change the image . the reason for this is that many surgical changes have not immediately visible , but then left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you can read and comp@@ ress pictures , and eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , they produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by a relatively sharp m@@ ask@@ an in a major neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to produce un@@ sharp m@@ asked always arti@@ fact . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters always at least just as good as the sp@@ ur@@ ine mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in machining of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ locked image , see :
the original f@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the Auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information about the methods of shar@@ p@@ ec@@ tual structure in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
in order to generate the dis@@ course of the range of the dark@@ ening range , in order to generate an even more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ner Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are shown below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings you can use the tab and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value causes homogen@@ eous regions smoo@@ thing and details . a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be necessary . please note that the detailed information should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
gui@@ ding depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ther evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be able to generate a high value of similar patterns . JPEG art@@ e@@ facts are best eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative brightness . therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter regards greater structures . the higher this value is determined , the more will appreciate even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 .
angle link since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , you should also choose that small angle should generate a long runtime . so you should choose this value as possible and choose your needs acceptable .
integ@@ rative step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality which you received by selecting this option is only little . it doubles but the running time . we recommend it out .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . any setting of image error correction may be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take very long and take a high CPU load after getting off . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob .
below you can see how to remove image error with minor Ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you see , there is an autonomous black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ os r@@ mp was a powerful tool to reduce image data . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is a selectable image filter available to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ous ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can consult this tutorial in this tutorial .
the screen photograph above shows a typical scene created with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ining noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the lower @-@ window details and the advanced setting for advanced settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time limit values per pixel and can display the picture above the radius given in the picture and the colour in it is bent and thus smaller flaws can be adjusted .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter forward . if it is increased , it needs to be reset . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can not receive any more and noise or sm@@ iling .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole space can be removed or smoke tips . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without loos@@ ing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance impedance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings will not affect the smoo@@ ther process that controls the details pane .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings will not be controlled by the smoo@@ ther process that controls the details pane .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges which typically seem to increase . however , it does not cont@@ am@@ inate the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing damp@@ ing . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear to occur . if it is on a minimum , smo@@ kers and ph@@ y@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can easily remove pir@@ ate and is the recommended method for this .
store up and loading : these buttons are used exactly to use . all parameters for smo@@ kers that you have set can be stored in the file system and re@@ charged later .
this is an example of how spo@@ ilers your life can change . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct size was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ pen the image is much easier than a picture . use this tool to correct soft@@ ly setting and experim@@ enting with the setting . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; standoffs digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo sessions .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts of your images . it is very well adapted to pl@@ unge cas@@ c@@ tures , c@@ ater , compression party acts and local mist@@ akes linked to digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . the glasses are made along the image con@@ tours and thereby obtain the content as it also makes human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture of texture . the texture is developed with another tool , the image error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ology and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . than a los@@ s@@ able compression algorithm created some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ e@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ ra@@ ration can now be stored in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take a very long time and take a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation anytime by button .
below you can reduce the image as a photo with equ@@ alis@@ man &apos;s noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the fil@@ tering . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be applied to an old colour photo , which was created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts alleged by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ light and the photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos that were with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i Project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ ies .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially in high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel screen ; there is currently no manual approach to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with the picture dark@@ image . the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark@@ image directly in connection to cover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark@@ image to the correct image . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and automatically loads it to the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all stocks .
select an area to see the def@@ ectives at the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filter available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ectives in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 out of pixels will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels have moved with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing , in the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug was taken ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. lower corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often do not even illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shaded ) by reducing the light and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor . teleph@@ oto objective show this behaviour also .
however , it has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be possible , also with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects arise through motion .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s fil@@ tering and color @-@ scale ranges from digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter that is used without these filters . the tool is protected by a Cent@@ er@@ filter onto a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with a aperture setting of 2 , rela@@ xes the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reducing it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
rein@@ force Leu@@ ch@@ thickness , contrast and gamma settings : the edit of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication error correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need only to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the knob provides you only positive values as you need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ tuning of the expos@@ e of the target , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug . image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the lid in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . an image error correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous membrane is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ ent@@ ils on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gradient is treated the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar effect effect , but eight to the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient is corrected the remote corners opposite the second gradient . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion is almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values can be corrected tonn@@ age forms and positive values of c@@ ann@@ ular distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth gradient . this value is stronger to change than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ ent@@ ils , the &apos; facets parameter re@@ marked the parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and performs the correction of the first Gra@@ des . negative values increase while positive the picture decreased .
light : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box with a preview the distortion of correction . values you use for your image , are stored and used for the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or CO2 @-@ shaped correction should be done prior to all mapping or size changes . if you have a picture to cut a image and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent error .
to help you get the best correction to you this tool is a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , like the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this spot . in the connection , you can correct the c@@ en- / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
when you correct a cold @-@ shaped distortion is adjusted the resulting image of black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing or the zoom of this dialog .
for most images , the tonn@@ age @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like photos from the front , frames and paintings is the perspective to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand you will always have a slight decrease of perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is listed below ( 1 ) and corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ implic@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter is re@@ produced the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust film gra@@ dations and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob has changed the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter can@@ als are mix@@ es for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , because the colour information are missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ ar used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is listed below ( 1 ) and the image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the trot@@ ter .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film dial is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film@@ strip on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films . the manufacturers of large silver @-@ baskets of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film turn@@ out effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere of daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ gra@@ cious , gra@@ ce@@ ful sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film @-@ gra@@ ined effect on a black / white image . the original image is ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two knob to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five . thick brushes are better for larger images . smoo@@ thing controls the smooth or , from the other side view , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the edit is characterized by the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity control to create a cab@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . the lines whose gra@@ dients are slowly change , so you could imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good images to start .
there are two knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving the picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stack@@ ed in wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ og@@ amy scenery .
the depth allows the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work through distortion effect . it uses the protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells , and lets it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture in an art work by means of im@@ aging effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Series : wi@@ ping the image along the sensitive lines that go out from a center . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ ant un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image by rotation of the pixel to a central point . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ ping the picture to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of one linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photo , camera .
sof@@ ten : wi@@ pe the image soft in the dark and powerful in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ting inc@@ and@@ escent sphere .
layer im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image by random shi@@ fting of pixels and simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the colour@@ ings in the image and wi@@ ping them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation anytime by button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice small tool to make rain@@ drops onto your picture . this makes it a natural look for natural images . it uses a natural Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allowed it to alter the size of the drop @-@ size . because the sample size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . the number of drops changes in the image changes on the image .
you can stop using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; im@@ aging an area freely from rain@@ drops . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , who shall start to stay free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the range will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of regul@@ ate fil@@ tering . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the worked image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset in a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the pop @-@ up menu and forming mirrors .
photo puff@@ ed is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a picture at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to resi@@ sti@@ ve is simple . the big question is how to keep up a picture and see the details sharp ? how can you obtain the lack of information ? how can you see the lack of information ? how can you see the lack of information ? how can you see a good job here . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo set the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . choose a change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is visible below .
the tool for the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to burn the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many educational software programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ous algorith@@ ms was used by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in a tab New size and will be listed below :
maintain page @-@ ratio : if this setting is enabled , the size ratio of the original size will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter regards greater structures . the higher this value is determined , the more will appreciate even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly . any insertion for photo can be saved as text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast in what it makes , but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load after getting off . you can cancel the calculation anytime by button .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by using a small color on the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication by comparison .
the feed of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequent under@@ estimated tool to connect to a picture . to cut the mouse , simply drag the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the ch@@ equ@@ es , then you will see this rectangle below the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos would be cut off . this allows you to cut a good overview like your photo after the cutting . you can create the size of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle by clicking it easy with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the check @-@ in , use the button trimm@@ ing button from the tool bar and the photo is made ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file size save or save Save In the menu file to store the newly designed photo .
in the preview range you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog .
in tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in the portrait aspect ratio , the larger value of the height and the width of the width is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio is used for aspect ratio . meaning that it is always equal to whether you are using centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons are available to display ally horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog box you can set up with the Max . ratio button in the range for cutting on the size possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ lowers its aspect ratio ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are stored as standard dimensions in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected the cut @-@ in image , and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions help you to fl@@ atten out to create your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third par@@ agus , harmon@@ ic triangles is an opportunity to share a rectangle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden center is a pitch prop@@ ell@@ ates onto different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus Shell or the bl@@ ossom forms of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all kinds of things we can feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to create your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times , when you have your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is headed by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two previous numbers . a composition that is usually followed as a visu@@ ally harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents liquid aid lines provided when you have a picture :
the Golden Spir@@ al gets you good results for your photos to achieve good results . in comparison to third party produces a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric flow on this species .
another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called the golden quad@@ ran@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . this one can be a line or various objects . this one can easily be turned as without the eye , it will satisfy its task .
the golden triangles are also from the above mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tex are the middle points of the sides of the golden bound@@ ary . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are not an equ@@ ate triangles . diagonal can be published as a static object dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect of professional photograph@@ ers , dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image view at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach other .
the Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror are used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the knob color you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines in your current picture .
the Free press is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can repair it with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; im@@ aging and the tool @-@ free rotation . choose the right rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the button default you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right @-@ hand side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
on your help , the Module can position a horizontal and a vertical line . after you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now just adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you can find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transformer cut out of the frame .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option g@@ rie@@ ve the picture a bit after rotation . however , keep the above warning .
all per@@ sp@@ ine transform@@ ations are done by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview is then re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that you can help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angles on top : shows the current angle at degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle at degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after that you have adapted the perspective , you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some this is the picture with transform@@ ations of cutting out of the frame .
the shaft tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture will be distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . this module allows you to start trans@@ forming this module .
create your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you are using pres@@ ets , the angles are displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right and the new dimensions of the target box are displayed on the right .
to help you get a vertical and a horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out , the picture will wi@@ pe out a bit . for a single scra@@ per , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two scra@@ per is created twice as much mist@@ akes and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the picture , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate this is the picture with transform@@ ations of cutting out of the frame .
&amp; digi@@ os ; requires a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way as these libraries have comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images with &amp; digi@@ als .
due to the depen@@ dency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on this site . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ al issues ; shows only files in formats to know . this happens with the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the expansion is listed in the list is displayed , it is possible to change this list of file extensions ; it can be accepted . in the configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG from the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be stored even if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very useful instructions in JPEG or TIFF with the shell conversion from &amp; digi@@ os ; you can find more information about the usage of modules with &amp; digi@@ os ;
&amp; digi@@ os ; supports the shop of raw images only with the program d@@ wind@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ versions . all support cameras can be seen at the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats used by &amp; digi@@ os ; supported :
many digital cameras supports the recording short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ os ; however , it is not any film program and it has not been used to display or digi@@ plug . when you click on a movie File and digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use the program to playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module uses a series of images in a K@@ ML structure exported . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
if you are doing the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well , if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four alignment using the cartridge .
many tools you need to create your photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included . your description are shown here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , &amp; etc . use a uniform dialogue until the filter is applied to the current picture before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; texture &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter onto the current picture . on the left of it allow 5 buttons to change the comparison modes of the preview . these modes are :
vertically share without duplic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the chosen area .
horizont@@ ally share without duplic@@ ates . the upper range shows the original and the bottom display the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
vertically split . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divide . the upper section shows the original and lower to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over@@ - and under@@ taking exposure . the use colors can be adapted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can view this frame with the mouse within the picture and click on the picture of the image , which you want to see the preview of the left section of the dialog box is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all entries can be noticed from the last use of the module .
the page bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the main parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . you can push it on your left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course going to contain your image of G@@ eo data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit colour pall@@ ets and select colors of colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are from &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the colour of the signature . the colour is described under the pallet view . here the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move your mouse with pressing left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted uni@@ qu@@ or below the button , the color is inserted from the color panel at cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode you can set by select the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ fin@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for every colour three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende sign , if there are three numerical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , it can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ o credit ; inserted .
the colors in palette and output of the colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a colour somewhere on the screen and then you can find in the shade on the left .
&amp; k@@ not@@ e@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . Graph@@ ene is used in science , especially in computer science , and so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . programs that are &amp; &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the research viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing those programs by modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ not@@ e@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ us ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ ene . &amp; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; no@@ graphic viewer ; shows Graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

more required software : &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the graphic arts ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph@@ s . you need in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphics , each in a own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool bar will open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list . click on the first icon to display the dialog box .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the Gra@@ ph is bigger than the drawing area . you can choose a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and low without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just modified in &amp; no@@ graphic ; charged file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph will be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ not@@ viewer ; can you know your decision to change it later , you can use the menu settings of graphical inter@@ viewer ; see also , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ ite file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; instance , if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook , you will choose whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ not@@ e@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the angular graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but these can also change also with the dialog dialog .
during programming start , you can open all the graphics of your last session . again , you can save your choice either as well as later .
you can also define , as the Gra@@ ph shall be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphite on one side will be igno@@ red on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the Graph@@ ene .

the site again returns the option to determine the behavior , if a file has been changed on hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the site is opening the way to determine the behavior of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; you can define a default behavior for this case ( open the graph@@ s in a new window or determine the current session or in a window of the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site seat management gives the option to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; you can set up a standard behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) or determine where to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which usually appears with one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , will open further options :
here you can choose from different &amp; graphical algorith@@ ms ; select entries , as described in the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ le@@ ased graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring@@ spring model . this is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is also significant with statistical differences in scale .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s a jump model -@@ layout . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ Rein@@ a @-@ He@@ ur@@ ist@@ ics , and includes a multi@@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the cir@@ co ; algorithm uses the no@@ de circular to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then specify a layout command as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graphics according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such layout command you can give &amp; eg ; algorith@@ ms special options , or modify the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ loaded ) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ le@@ ased graph@@ s ) .

select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog appears to download . in order to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file , just like the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , a automatic correlation was performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place here your camera zone .
setting for the maximum tim@@ epi@@ ece is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . the vari@@ ance is below . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ related all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any matching data . if you know that a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this limits here and then cor@@ relate this button to the inter@@ pol@@ isher .
the coordinates can be manually set by this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same place . since the dialogue , you need to use just the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map after and to be set . select the relevant region and enlarge it again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the amount must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Co@@ di@@ ers module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert selected images and image Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a base image file . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ ash@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can create a background color for the slide . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD file for your DVD player . finally , you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to install the images that are attached to the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then placed under picture files in the portfolio . you can also change sor@@ ting of the pictures or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you are choosing the file from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD decoder . in case you are planning to select the file on a TV , you need to set the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast of very smooth aspect ratio .
in doubt , the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should put them black . the name and the path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . keep your prom@@ pt you like .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start the film into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink it quickly or in all tranquility a coffee , and enjoy the slide show you back again .
if a hint appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets on the right side .
the print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . combined pictures can also be automatically used with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or print it with Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your RAW format stored in one from three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line @-@ tool d@@ c@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original score by Him is : expect from d@@ c@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera manufacturer . sometimes get better results ! .
first , select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the R@@ aw image conver@@ ter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re@@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for white ab@@ uses . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a quadru@@ ple R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to allow you to use contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion results are equal , and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you are frequently used to edit your pictures or later , you should not need to use JPEG format , as it has only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are adapted to keep the original data .
if you are using JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata of the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to stop this process , you can break it off .
the launching mode allows you to convert various images at one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual pictures . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the file automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress report shows how far the conversion is prog@@ ressed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp can be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image or enlarge it . to this end , four types of the image change are available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the aspect orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . accordingly , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , use this option to adapt your image to screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed when this option is changed .
printing preparation : prepare the image for the photo prints . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target pattern , including background size , bound@@ ary size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the number of pictures before . further pictures can be placed on the list of making pictures there .
after you started the module , the images will be displayed with the images shown by you . you can add additional pictures above the button . for the last image you can select a preview on the right side .
you can also draw images on the picture list and add it to the list of the images added to the list .
the pictures will be removed from the list of selected images from the list .
once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail client . you &apos;ll need to add only the addresses and the subject . pictures of the selected pictures are joined as app@@ endix .
do not pay attention to many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails . it may be a good idea to send more emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used any time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify in the input field including the right path for your installation .
in case you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file the comments are added to a text file and added the email .
the PNG format below the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats as e.g. TIFF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend it to JPEG format .
if you are using JPEG pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ ails will be added to the leading images .
when the process is finished , the window will automatically shut itself down , so you can view the status messages when looking for errors . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button closure you can cut this window ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , there will be a window containing questions such as you want your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
option Open@@ GL is used in the presentation to use very elegant image outputs by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graph card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation in an endless loop is displayed . you can then proceed manually with Es@@ c .
the images are random@@ ly chosen to select that the pictures are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the images in the album .
under delay between the images you can set the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should mean that you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between whom you can choose . random cho@@ oses every transition between the pictures a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move your mouse into this corner to switch off .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left hand , you can see the current file names , the position of the actual picture and the total number of images shown in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .

if you enter a character string into the field of labelling or description , you may also enter the description and descriptions of the images by this text , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
using the options in the lower part of the window you can see all pictures after certain name as you can see in the picture . here is illustrated by images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; professional album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather than trying to try the following options , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ not@@ ation album ; and watch the quick @-@ up , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
start the demo album , and select the demo album , if you can start &amp; in your first dialog for the first time , or select the menu entry for your first time , or choose the menu entry menu . as a result , some example pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; cold album ; see the time line . a picture of this ly@@ re see here : . as the name suggests , this strip shows you data statistics on the images in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each strip will then show another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by taking the strip only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be inter@@ active in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the time line will always displayed the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of the time line by pressing the mouse button pressed and select the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so the time data will be displayed in the preview view just pictures of this period . you can remove the selection by clicking on a bar of the time line .
&amp; cold album ; provides you two possibilities available to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; cold album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following section of the user book it is described in &amp; k@@ not@@ ation ; integrated version that you can create using the menu file ...
before HTML pages have to be created , you have to make some settings . these are divided in the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area will be more precise .
first , enter the title of the transfer@@ ring and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on track album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; white album ; export file will be created on the review page . ferry information about export files can be found in .
last you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , all pictures are from a party . please note that all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain viewing .
in this section you can define how to look like the HTML pages . most import@@ ation possibilities are clearly , so it is not received specifically for this purpose .
below you can set different resolutions for the pictures . as a result , those who have to view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no images can download the resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the dis@@ solution at any time you can set up at any time . thus , it can display your pictures with low resolution , as if he wants to get a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the different folder and the URL to where your website is stored .
best , select a base folder for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . thus , you can select either a folder , or select a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check whether this really can choose all of the viewer . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you want to specify should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser should start the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you will not have to copy it manually in the final target folder , see , correctly you need to specify the final target of files . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the right adjustment possibilities have all three basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name can be set in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook , you would like to create a HTML page to viewing the images . if you have already turned a lot of time for viewing the images , shooting location , etc . , you have to go with &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; this work must not be done again .
with &amp; D album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the Bil@@ de@@ ig@@ en@@ ons are impor@@ ting and imported into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you can distinguish it whether the pictures are saved with the file or if you want to save all the pictures in the file , so you can keep all the pictures and this file is so independent . the apparent dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file search the images in double @-@ way . first it is looking for the images you want to have in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following form , the dialog for Export Pictures , which you can expor@@ ting from the menu file ...
the main option of this dialog is whether it is to act for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
when converting the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically put into the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; cold album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to compressed this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is file size limit . if you can send your friends pictures , you don &apos;t want to limit the pictures otherwise in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can say that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select &amp; cold album to import the exported database as described in .
the assistant to impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder you want to import pictures .
it may be that you are the category of persons to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be asked to imported the categories of the imported file and correspond to the categories these in your database .
in the fourth step , you can reserve the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it needs to be easy to browse images and view : if you look at pictures , you can view images of your Italy holiday information and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book , you will see the various steps from ( 1 ) to see the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) and see the search for up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ album was begun as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book it has been talked about pictures but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; cold album ; saves all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a dis@@ kette or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want to back .
&amp; k@@ not@@ ation album ; shows the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future start automatically . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start playing &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ not@@ ebook -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry default photo album ; set up ... proceed to a window where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook . in the following section of the user book you will discuss the various possibilities options .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can call the options of preview and the options for viewing the viewer . for each setting is a detailed help you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it has been described here , as you can set different properties for any picture , e.g. persons , locations and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog box , which is used to allow already existing groups . you can select a label and select a symbol for each existing groups .
in the sub@@ categories the sub@@ categories were already mentioned above . in the dialog options you can setup all members of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a gli@@ ed@@ eds as shown in .
in a list of setting options you can choose to set membership units . with the above listed list box , select the category you want to configure . in the left window side you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ not@@ ation album ; its modular system with other graphics applications like digi@@ plug and g@@ love . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . you can find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called over the menu Mod@@ ules . the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part@@ n@@ ered out of &amp; cold album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can create over the modules itself .
since the modules can be used together with multiple applications , it may be possible to test the modules with &amp; cold album ; for example , you should always try out new modules first using the demo file using the command &gt; k@@ photoelectric album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I don &apos;t have been war@@ ned !
the applications that can use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; cold album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you divide functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; sk@@ ies , and other applications that can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other uses are not supported their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functionality with &amp; no@@ ff album ;
this album simul@@ ates &amp; white album ; the current album that is simply the actual view , so all the images that shows the picture preview currently shows .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ not@@ ation album ; the modules also has a list of albums . this goes to a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; B &apos;s album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then every entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have defined in the setting dialog for the category of virtual albums . if you are using the category persons , you will be able to receive &amp; spare album ; so do if you might have selected persons to view and to the module .
since several modules with &amp; k@@ not@@ ation album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setting dialog and select the modules installed which modules are loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you can start &amp; fli@@ er album ; start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top a menu and tool@@ bar . at the moment it does not look very much information since you have not yet come back on this window , and now click on the entry images to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook , is the opportunity to see each picture with notes , where the image has been taken on the picture , where the picture was taken individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks at the same time . if example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures have been recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this note when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in the event you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; cold album , as you can always use it again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on the move of the pictures within the list : if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 frames the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be shown , so that the names of the names are shifted upward , the persons can be found faster and arrange .
if you prefer a list of ill@@ iter@@ acy list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting to date below the list .
if you have selected notes on each image , you might want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with notes . click in this case just to the front and back buttons , which are located under the picture of the picture to the right .
if you have several pictures , for example with the same person , then it can be convenient to mark all these images and add multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all participating in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a su@@ peri@@ ority . in order to show you a special symbol is shown .
in the context menu of the An@@ per@@ ative alog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also move an entry to a category and put there to make this entry in a sub@@ category . attention , this assumes you make your categories alphabet@@ ically and see .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the parameter , by clicking the edges of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also create an own window by taking it outside the window section .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current construction and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame in a frame . if you want to get back this window later , use the button options ... and then window will see a / off . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all the pictures if you have no filters . you can configure the size of the preview photos , simply follow the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you make a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will set this picture as a background picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in picture viewer . if you still don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . select the corresponding pictures from you want and press either the button @-@ button or select menu click menu . now the window will show you on the picture you can see in the picture .
&amp; brochure Album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook . of course you have to store the pictures anywhere , so that you can catch the pictures anywhere ; in the picture you &apos;ll see the view of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; if not all the required images from the hard disk can be loaded .
photos , where the right corner is cut off , are not visible on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are available , so that you can view this image preview . you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this function you need to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid the insertion of the appropriate CD . if you want to avoid anger how to avoid the passage of your pictures , please buy a larger disk drive to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , fil@@ tering the pictures so that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on current view . alternatively , you can see all the pictures you can watch your little sister , increasing and menu entry everything except recent view .
with this , you have defined what pictures are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you have to lock the laptop for your little sister , simply select all the pictures you want to lock . if you want to get the pictures again , click to lock up .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to the images . in order to establish this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is by no safe . to a one you can extract or delete all photos on the disk or to others . this kind of password protection is used only to those who are using &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; not very familiar to look at private images .
the reason why you can spend all your images with &amp; k@@ not@@ ching album ; administ@@ er and try hours over hours . this is why you want to view it sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ not@@ ary look . this is why you can start from preview , as described in .
you can see the viewer . of course , it displays the image , but additional all the information you have to enter on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , then you can also move it with the mouse and what else can be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the context menu can be shown below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this screen . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have multiple images on the viewer , you can jump between them and back , by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from context menu .
if multiple images are up@@ loaded into the viewer , you can then run them as slide show . as frequently it can run a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can press a new picture by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s viewer &apos;s album ; is it possible to change in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer in the image and zoom out in the image . using the Min@@ us button you can draw up again . using the Min@@ us button you can get r@@ out to the center of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the equ@@ ine key , the zo@@ oms set , so every pixel corresponds to a pixel of the picture .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations can work out with videos that are in @-@ and out with the Plus@@ and and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can note notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you are looking at pictures , you can see a picture with one person whose name you have forgot to set on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and configuration dialog of the image to view this name . however , you may preview only the picture to select and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and select it as good or bad you can view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch pictures with features while you watch it . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images are available , you can see them in your browser . if you have all the pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and Charac@@ ters can be displayed in the preview site . if you view categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can simply add characteristics to the images by clicking the picture after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to see &amp; spare album ; paint on the picture .
the ground @-@ old is not saved with the picture but in the database . on the way you can make your m@@ old later back@@ ward .
in this image , you can see a painting on the picture . in order to switch to the screen mode of &amp; cold album ; select the image from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should definitely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the slides and the object is depicted in the wire window views .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object object is an already selected object , since all object objects are already selected with the object .
to include a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either to insert the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are multiply possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be embedded in order to select the right position :
with del@@ etion either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have any properties changed , click on users to take these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , you can read the input errors and re @-@ click on users or re@@ vo@@ ke changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; allows user documentation in setting dialog , you can call &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with assistance .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 provides a user documentation .
when you process a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the self @-@ economic view .
if you want to preview in your own view and a small example of the scene is rendered to the selected texture . if you want to choose the whole texture . if you want just a portion of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture rate and not the entire texture rate ) , cross it locally .
screen photograph shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction to the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it becomes displayed a small cross in the wire @-@ scale view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for moving distances . you can change the shift through drawing with the mouse within the entire window .
every object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level . you can specify this value relatively to the sight of the superior object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility of visible or equal to the viewing angle of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object pattern and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need any other arrangement , you can set them anywhere . you can also store multiple window orders and simply changing between different orders .
to anchor a window over or under one view , drag the facade to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle below shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the facade to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this list and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on each other , then draw the facade in the middle to another list . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ oning card top in the views .
the last possible shut@@ ters are floating Vi@@ ews : Vi@@ ews , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the sl@@ ender , drag the anus to the desktop or click the left arrow pointing to the left button .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the address bar . to prevent the closing button , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it to arbitr@@ ary place .
the current window view can store you up with a view window . it is displayed a dialog where you can save up the window of the window under a existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be installed properly . when this manual was written correctly . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ ders The symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can easily insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality .
when you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or menu View menu , select the following dialog box :
each channel mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of mode .
in the box size you can put the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and give the image section to ren@@ ders the input fields .
in combination field quality you can choose the characteristics that are using &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user retro @-@ lighting . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with only one beam per pixel is rendered , various errors can arise . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ ky sample or lines in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of these mist@@ akes . in general , pictures featuring this feature is better .
when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , then connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called Super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive to the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel continues to split again and adap@@ tive to the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray goes a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values steps to the adjacent pixels will be adjusted to 4 , then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 @-@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixels will be tra@@ ced individually and to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set to the depth of the depth .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the Stra@@ it process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to calculate the diff@@ use light reflection rate . it takes very long to comp@@ ute a scene with this feature .
on this box card you can set if the alpha @-@ channels can be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the matching radiation has no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ able ; scene , select the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently Suppor@@ ted by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if in case of impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; c@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , please send this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ able . this adds the source code of the object into the file . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and draw him in the object @-@ tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is called a scene . usually this is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
when you click on assistance in your own view , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ man ; user documentation to the displayed object . ask the path to your document as well as the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example altitude data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ man ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first file is used .
colour of the wire models . the second colour is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color of the control points . the second colour is used for displaying the selected controls .
the color of the rectangle for the sight field in the camera view and in the window type plate .
you can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of the open @-@ line menu . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and la@@ thes .
greater values give a more accurate wire model and thus better support for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects like the ball , you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high dimensions for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature provides a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is depicted in a chess boards from two adjustable colours .
when you cross the ground , a bottom drops below the objects . the floor is depicted in a chess boards from two adjustable colours .
if you cross edge distribution , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for rendering scenes is used . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . more precisely to the parameters you will find in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can modify or create new window orders . in section window orders , as you can create and store window orders .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard @-@ window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the chosen window can be used at the start of the program .
the list Ex@@ t@@ ant window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can create and delete a select arrangement with the button Remove .
any window arrangement is identified by name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window structures . new views can be created by clicking with the button and select selected views on the button Remove .
with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , where you anchor a new column on the right window , with box card you get a card @-@ card screen , together with the previous view , and floating the view on the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ able ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all the steps in this guide , you should be able to use the ultimate but simple scene : a ball on a plane .
but you should be careful attention please note yourself , before you make sure that you use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you insert no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black image .
if you have any error free , you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ installed Window System :
take a little time to get the menus and the existing icons of the tool bar . please read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then choose the menu entry , so that you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene , which you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth open @-@ model view ( lower bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows the result of the ren@@ der@@ y of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on , see the contents of view object Properties in which the various parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ u , you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera has to change in the camera control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . click on the left mouse button on a control point and move it to the desired position .
when you press the button to use or the input buttons , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree are immediately changed according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . you might set a cross@@ wise ( insert ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a controversi@@ al method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is indeed a sim@@ pler option . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object @-@ tree , change the name and press the button to use or the input . in the object tree the new name is instantly displayed .
the wire @-@ size view is now also showing the level , if also at the moment , only as a limited level . if you ren@@ der@@ y the scene , the level extends down to the horizon .
if you can view the object tree , you will find that you can see the entry for the bottom + prior to the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and move . select one of these options , change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . choose shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
at the moment , choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose the moment some simple .
in both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the own view ( name = floor @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of pigments are only a mat black material because you have to specify the settings for the pigment . remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time using a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way to now .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and sphere , click on the button to use and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course you don &apos;t have the colour ben@@ ches . here you have need additional settings . in the color list you need to insert two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do it even more frequently , but the chess board colour chec@@ kl@@ ist can be used only with two colors ) :
in the hab@@ itat each time you are in mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics :
this step you should already perform just as you can already understand the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . already , the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input button or the button to press ) , so the sphere has shifted to the floor , as you shifted the floor to down@@ wards .
of course , Ren@@ ders get a sel@@ dom result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears as a mat black material . set in the following step a suitable material .
if you chose the ball , you can now add a material . as already in the ground , enter the sphere a pigment as paint :
choose the most recent object and change the name for example in sphere of pigment . click on the base of pigments , select and put the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time , put some finish characteristics :
change the values as in the following screen shots and click on users or press the input button .
the settings of the brightness and reflection already produce some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what capabilities you have &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . hop@@ efully you have learned them much , but you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender will be refle@@ cting and broke the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the m@@ ist effect . so the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will be able to see without a camera without the camera . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
you can select your file in the usual file dialog . P@@ ov@@ able files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
the scene in the last saved version recovered . all changes since last storage are igno@@ red .
you can only choose this menu entry only if you have not saved any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last edit orders . this menu entry can only be selected , if you have to use Edit menu .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or order an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for the setup of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the key fol@@ ds and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for change the short@@ cut . you can change or add commands to this option for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler .
opens a dialog to setup tool@@ bars . you can add and remove from this option tool@@ boxes for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is one way to make har@@ sh surfaces , without changing any b@@ ump on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both B@@ ump @-@ Map and a texture Map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of this fundamental body . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is one way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , using an image file as a color chart .
the app has a comfortable web browser and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed in either a window in the image of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; g@@ alley is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return Return .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file on Brow@@ ser@@ window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
when setting up - &amp; g@@ ick@@ show , there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work from &amp; g@@ ick@@ show . in the two other , short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser , the key code can be specified for the respective windows .
if the image is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background color , which you can set down below . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , load &amp; g@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option records &amp; pick @-@ up show ; when don@@ ate the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , opening &amp; check show ; this folder on browser window opens .
click on the colored beams to fill a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . when window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color here .
you can play &amp; c@@ em@@ show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program .
this option is enabled to display the display windows to the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
check if the slide show should begin with the first picture in the folder or the selected picture .
the time span between the image change at a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default value is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated until it is dismant@@ led by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the key photo here for the different operating modes of &amp; g@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards of a Short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for folder and a window for the files ) and the partial view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

in the area of exposure indicators you can select the colour which is displayed if the sub or over@@ exposure indicators have been selected , in contrast , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure should be displayed a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; possesses a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; is an application for scanning of images that do not make more than p@@ ans and p@@ ans .
&amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; is an easy application to sc@@ anned images that do not make more than images to store and save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can view the pictures before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner at the complete project page by entering the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projected / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; with the command set -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no default scanner is specified , then a dialog box is open to selecting the scanner .
user can select the scanner to open scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; termin@@ ate it .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not cover these options .
in order to scan an image , the user can only start a preview can and then scanning the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by a preview knob .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom out into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in the window that fits the complete preview of the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if pre @-@ Save a preview for the settings , then the picture is displayed in a box window as shown below , then the image is stored and lie down ? EN leads to a break and you will return to the main window .
the quick settings will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ el@@ ite ; pictures stores . dialog for saving every picture open the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite is to store the dialog box in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without having to ask a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored at the Save without any file name , then this folder will be stored as standard for the dialog . default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image to save images and , in addition , the proposed name for the image on the saving . automatically saved the picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the character string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can custom@@ ize the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button assistance starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; Manual . the button 1 starts to the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ ep@@ ite ; . the button closure shows the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to termin@@ ate &amp; stop .

the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP features , playlist , playlist , and scripts . a sample recall for the D@@ COP @-@ function break may look &amp; z@@ b ; so look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some separate line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t work because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use cookies , so the user does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from ger@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is . for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in scripts scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply to extend the required functions . you will quickly find that the letter of scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ il@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that every K@@ DE installation should be climbed .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the run of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends mail messages to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts are to monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the dialog for storing files . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folders to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change Sign@@ s that a new piece is played . the script could now add &amp; z@@ b ; with the COP @-@ functions , further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ et@@ ric disk volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu entry , Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be identified . to add a custom entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script for Custom@@ ize Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so for instance , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok@@ s script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can be optionally detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user may recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok Script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Extended amar@@ ine script . for this reason , you should name your script packages like correctly .
the main cre@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org , and you can attach the link to the Wik@@ i script from &amp; am@@ per@@ ch ; for your entry at k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; has many useful and powerful features and is still sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ per@@ ch ; you can simply drag the music to playlist , rather than just a particular titles from thousands of your collection . maybe you &apos;ll also find a special titles from thousands of your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ct browser and the quick@@ est search will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some playlist , but may not decide what you want to hear ? then , the playlist , if it is still hard to choose , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically set the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . Moreover , many different audio systems can be used , such as you can listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , the following must be compiled and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty . if you encounter any problems , please inform them in the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing lists .

playlist , to save , stores the current playlist automatically at the Be@@ ing &amp; am@@ per@@ ator ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
relative P@@ aths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , the relative path to the music files , based on the location of the playlist , otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored .
to make any piece of work visible when the piece is visible , the playlist will be up / rolled off to keep the current always in the visible window field .
when change in the context of context @-@ browser , you will automatically switch the context @-@ browser whenever the next piece is played .
in the appearance , you can easily adjust &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; s appearance is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; am@@ per@@ ately . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist , Player windows and Cont@@ ext browsers . press on selecting ... , so you can select a font font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the Qu@@ al of your choice and can define their own color scheme . use this color selection for front and background color .
play back to the start , that &amp; am@@ per@@ ch ; after the program start the playback starts automatically with the piece at the place finish , with which it stopped at the last stop .
the lower @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to set an optional O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display it is displayed , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialogue the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow that the text in the O@@ SD shaded .
your own colours are available to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors do not use , the pre@@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors used .
the input field display text indicates the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by setting plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen &apos;s option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . you can define it on which screen a multiple @-@ monitor environment should appear in the O@@ SD .
the box card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the select field . some drivers will enable any further adjustment possibilities in this box card .
the boxes collection will be used for setting up all the settings for your collection . it includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ per@@ ch ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sive : this causes that &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; both the inter@@ viewed as well as their sub@@ folders according to music is being displayed .
in order to monitor : enables &amp; am@@ end to monitor the selected folders ( eg . if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search will be performed to make the necessary modifications at your collection .
play@@ lists impor@@ ting that &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; all found play@@ lists were added to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the added playlist will appear then later in the playlist @-@ Browser @-@ browser .
the part Colle@@ ct database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination field driver is used between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another institution is necessary in the sub@@ window of MySQL .
the MySQL facility is used for setting up the database for &amp; am@@ per@@ ers ; it is used on the computer that the MySQL database is located . afterwards , in the port : the network port is entered under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; can create the names of played pieces at a loads .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current account .

&amp; am@@ per@@ ator ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the features and the gallery with screens .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs as installed ( including those contained in the programs , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to find such modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide as you compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as O@@ SD is predic@@ ting that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example , but we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these are an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will present an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library if you can see the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ per@@ .@@ log . please report the cap@@ ut@@ tered file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection again .
mostly it is known that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try again SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; am@@ per@@ ch ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; am@@ per@@ formers ; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version . if , for example &amp; am@@ per@@ ately , with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash when met@@ a met@@ a @-@ information .
when you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate the engine . dis@@ able if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ drop by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically during a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you will receive a good back@@ drop , the error is guaranteed .
this is the fact that many program data is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 in the Meta @-@ Info , but this is not known as Unicode knowledge . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

if you receive this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : Un@@ less Symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ dem@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if am@@ aro@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . you can view it with ld@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix these mist@@ akes , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so .@@ conf it is that am@@ aro@@ K first finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are going on the lightest by the help of a experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the help with other users or for developers . do not use the forum and the I@@ RC under Irish fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please use only one bug where you can find something at the rec@@ ess of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ per@@ ately , there is only a blank playlist . how to get there music pieces there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of these icons were changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points will be automatically calculated .
to rate these things , in the playlist , select the evaluation box and select column . click somewhere in the new Review column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist to down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse in the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do it with other files . so easy : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add button , the button playlist , click on .
probably you &apos;ll find the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; am@@ per@@ ch ; newly . see also after lib@@ tool , this package includes many nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it about the menu bar at the equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question are the media types supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support Text and PNG !
it may be ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where the default does not use MP3 dec@@ or ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input loads
start the Ya@@ que online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option ( Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s as from : - )
if you are using the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer for the same time and give the same time audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mix@@ ers ) .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem @-@ cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
that does not do so . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . you can simply select a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the best option if you are reading a decade with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coding the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can give directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open your sound server with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ ctor SU@@ ID is set .
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause rever@@ t playback . read this error report . read this error file in your AL@@ SA plug@@ in file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably you are using the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller buffer , the less jobs react , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ per@@ ately ; why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must record all components . perform G@@ ST @-@ Register to record all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stream .
try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download and install it . then execute G@@ ST @-@ register once more than your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stri@@ l @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register once again . start now &amp; buy now .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet , such programs are designated as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding and use audio data streams and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 Decoder can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , allowing you to read FLA@@ C files and write .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to dec@@ ryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD to burning . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary system that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for the video processing . you will need if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one in the functional scope fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . that can be meaning@@ ful as creating a rented CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording result of the different albums to the un@@ pleasant effect that the music pieces will be played differently according to the standards .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start playback of CD and play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was saved once , the previous file was over@@ written , otherwise , according to a new file names .
the current project records the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog store is displayed , with which you can select file and file names for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same when you would like to save for any single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and was not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , to what should happen . you can then choose between saving and modifications . furthermore , you can also break down and open the project so .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non stored project , what should happen to be done so you would have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non stored project , what should happen to be done so as if you were called Cl@@ ose file .
if you call this entry , you can choose from the published dialogue files to add the project . this has the same effect when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files are added in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ ning for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog for the Project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . burning process can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current Project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of them are talking about what is it ? help ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you want to merge files for a previous session . this is useful if you are not using files for a multiple session . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustrates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files are lost in the project . this feature is removed no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends just the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this also allows you to create copying a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also copy a copy of a CD instead of the normal copying . you should also prefer to copy them if you want CDs with def@@ ectives or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to create copying a DVD onto another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a DVD with the help of copying device . additionally , the target medium must be big enough to store the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . using this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes it completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes of writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a new CD image . the dialog asks you to set up for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file are currently burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as No.1 g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously prepared DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously capable DVD video can be converted to you . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the syn@@ th@@ ical view , but may also contains all information about the le@@ ached video , body settings and even options for changing the size and for cutting black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include attributes of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is presently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small l@@ ath is displayed on the bottom edge of the window . it contains information on the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is bl@@ ended .
the folder icon is activated or off . folder icon contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media information , locks and un@@ lock the drive or cast the media .
off the content view , or off . the content view allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs as long as a drive selected using a corresponding CD / DVD folder .
the head bar in the project view is one or off . the head bar is a nar@@ rower range that contains only visible when the proj@@ ectile has no real function , it looks just beautiful and separates the proj@@ ections clear from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog for changing the keyboard arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . once you have chosen one of the available commands at the upper part , you can adjust the key rules to the below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; entry assist@@ ants . this means that the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator right ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b opens . here you can do general programming settings . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , for example , should work on An@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with an &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by using a sh@@ ell@@ ar .
to use the &amp; COP ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore , rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which the bit@@ rate of programs you will give it .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then you should make something like the following at the console :
besides general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that are all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two more parts are described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features like cop@@ y@@ CD , format@@ ted format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video Converter ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref lim@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) , cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) ) , cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) ) introduced @-@ format d@@ vd ( ) ) , Bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one obt@@ ains a project via the command line : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) , cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) , add@@ ressing ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , and the e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) .
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ fol@@ li@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ aw@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / / fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; read @-@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can be easily read audio CD ; s can be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many co@@ di@@ ers supported by this WAV files ( compression @-@ free compression ) . more co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if you have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , this WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or in other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , to read out the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ ging ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed . however , all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , but only the co@@ di@@ ers are not used . if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not needed .
which encoding / file format is supposed to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to circum@@ vent an protected audio CD ; do not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid easy purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup must be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after which the daily handling of a &amp; CD has to be found . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which will be quite frequent in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . )
it can collect &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the master window . on the side step by step , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the register maps for configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB file is based on the CD data based on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first to connect to the internet . )
start reading and - when a encoder has been configured in the tab Settings menu - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so the option can be read from other encoder as standard . it &apos;s necessary to set up the encoder in the tab dialog box dialog .
opens the file manager so that a file up@@ set file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the dialog for Settings to configure the messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ tics ) for Program@@ s ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
open the main dialog for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you will go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coefficient and compression ratios , and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information should go lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; hormon@@ es &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos;s , which may be available for this distribution . these dis@@ advantages are the low compression ratios , and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats to lose information by data compression , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may now have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distributors free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG , easily deep @-@ deep quality for lower bit rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ play devices are present .
MP3 - if music is also being heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning 2009 - these devices are usually only MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and comp@@ ressing the compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This attitude should offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music from yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and aut@@ ism . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely love the absolutely highest quality without back view of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually @-@ entered or automatically be collected from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the coding program for creating the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ gen , there is often a combination of program settings for the coefficient and these parameters . the manual or assistance to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD , titles to the key@@ words ( english : day ) , if MP@@ 3s shall be encoded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button closure in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database to read / enter the information / input so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself into the computer . it is to be aware that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translation ) I &apos;m not attor@@ ney . however , no one can extract the information on the &amp; CD ; more or less value , so you can &apos;t get rid of the artist nor the music company damage . all information can be obtained at a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtually preserved .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is active a check box ( S@@ end of a address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address of the server does not seem to use ( This can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator , used for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical area should be used on the next common mirror servers . this saves bandwidth in the network and make the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a current list of mir@@ ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the whole database can be downloaded or ( usually written monthly ) only the updates to the database .
what is duplic@@ ation program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
it is rum@@ oured that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . if you want to be more precise , seek out in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD @-@ CD . see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed at first if this is not yet happened .
to save the downloaded WAV files , the code can be chosen for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ ers package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution , before the coefficient may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the Chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a body , more information about his switches will be replaced by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg . console ) . thereby &apos; l@@ ame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed body .
this may have many reasons . check the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step Example . even if you use other settings , you can do it as you need to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything they understood , but somehow it is still uns@@ af@@ e what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to create those areas exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to create everything and create our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer installed . both programs should be considered pre @-@ compiled pack@@ ets for your Linux distribution as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can do it .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is sure to have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy with the quer@@ or anything ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for any application &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoding factor for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are used and what structure is used . since we are la@@ zy to use the program , the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read a &amp; CD , if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is delivered to the evaluation program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real instrument name of your running process . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also possible , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab as well as an attempt on using existing records of device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the box card General Settings . here you don &apos;t want to do a lot . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be plan@@ ed / entered as shown in screen photo .
only for incomplete information , so you will be informed when information is missing to the use of keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selective field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; record is found immediately if you are not satisfied with the database entry / file names or day entries , they can easily be changed . the directory entry or file name is changed using Kon@@ qu@@ ee - &gt; ren@@ ame and tag@@ ging the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , you can use the option e@@ fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . however , this is about 620 MB big , consider it twice if it is worthwhile . to make fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected at least the first . mode is set up on the following boxes .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings on the Internet access , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server about the Internet . how do you know the system to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . do everything as shown on screen photo .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . on this way the load between the host is distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both will work identical to the server , but many Fire@@ walls will bo@@ unds the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the web .
in this example , we do not want to transfer &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply apply the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is why more than one at the same time when using existing drive ? parallel . reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore try to try .
CD ; cast off after reading the last piece : cross it on the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : if you cross this file , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored . if the box is not crossed , the files will not be inserted in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to make anything with the WAV files .
all such as it is on screen photo . the command is a little bit long , under circumstances , it must be bl@@ amed to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo equipment . the resulting bit@@ rate is in average approximately 224 up to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creating tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later amendment of tags . % f and % are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : on a dual @-@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizing structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is described , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each active &amp; CD .
since we are a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , check the screen photos as a little differently than the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful retri@@ eve deleted data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data will be manually loaded instead of sending them out of the Internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed , as in screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and could be identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for questions and answers following the help or proceed to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that it is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key to your &amp; CD ; lets you select a window , and you can select the database @-@ entry , which fits your opinion on your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually extract it by choosing the first button in tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , but you will need the connection to the internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field may be used for the individual comments in@@ filtr@@ ating per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eve of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to begin the content of the CD @-@ editor ( e.g. whether all words are starting with major letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted notes .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags for the artist , album and titles of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you set ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; maximum allowed this option is set up in the &apos; basic settings &apos; tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can even create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . check in the Help to Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select an entry , which is apparent with the style of issu@@ ing CD ; this example is not important because we don &apos;t want to transmit the &amp; CD ; data just don &apos;t go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album already are filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . enter the title of the piece for each case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories the database .
it is the third button on the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a unit . only the titles are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or make sure all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selection to read the reading process , this window appears to be confirmation . click OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the rider orders to change to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the left part of the window at the status line .
this error message appears when you are attemp@@ ting to work with a co@@ di@@ ers , which you have not yet installed . pieces not marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in this example . have you checked if you have read write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . thus , read and coding parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to in@@ hibit this behaviour . the only machine that is configurable , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and coding ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order on the waiting period of Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be embedded in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , you &apos;ll need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ ed@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , it is already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you &apos;ve probably done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users to use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for your needs like the program your needs can be adjusted once , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it displays images on different cards of cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read more ? even if only the help menu click on the first start of the program , without any reference point as it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when it is at the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or out of the un@@ usually short menu ?
why is it ? who reads that , probably already the program started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t count this manual . it is as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
strange when it has succeeded in buying the source file of &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to others , he has not having some features of real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time templates , also some features which have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel with emphasis on the button on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window can move to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( son@@ ograms or text lines ) . K@@ Mid uses automatically the procedures used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; c@@ de ; during playing a song , kick off at the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also download a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will also fall . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and re @-@ play the button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry menu from the menu item or make the emp@@ t@@ ask@@ bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts once you have to draw on the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( at several pieces they will be added to a collection and then added after each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive away with the kno@@ bs .
if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template . to get back the original pace , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the push button as a pressure on the button lets or the selecting the menu entry break in the menu , thus interrup@@ ting the button . do not play the empty space while not played , kicks off &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
song lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tured , others use Li@@ ed@@ t@@ external and again others . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are expected to be displayed , and even better : the event type is automatically determined , so you can adjust the record automatically . if you do not want to adjust the registration of the kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up a event type , select from the menu settings the entries as well as reading standards . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these will be part of the series . in this section , how you can use Colle@@ ctions efficiently .
to make a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under item . click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired results in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears again the file dialog box with which help you can select the required song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setup Automatic add to the collection .
when Automatic add to the collection is added , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using file or drag &amp; drop ) .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection , it is activated by opening a piece the temporary collection and emp@@ tied . this collection will then add to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the tune and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the series after the drop @-@ menu of the menu , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove them or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ fixed .
to play a tune , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button in previous piece , the entry predicted piece from the menu or press the button arrow .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection you to delete a collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter because it is not stored for leaving &amp; c@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , so becoming a trumpet while playing a piano .
if you only have one sound card , don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite color editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file showing all necessary modifications for playing a piece .
each section can appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section which may appear as often as desired . but it is necessary that each occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you can see that it is necessary to display that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map @-@ file as an e @-@ mail to allow you to come in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard , the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the principle of equality is igno@@ red . it is assumed that the GM crop protection are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also do not use line for any of the 128 instruments .
the optional all @-@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the tones when using this instrument ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can remove a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a for@@ bad . this is what you do not apply to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so , if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( cra@@ cking shot ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , ir@@ respective of which the sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch which is meant with every tone a different per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) represents and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( such as some keyboards . ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify as sounds on a specified channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their availability . you must therefore produce 128 entries .
you can define several Ke@@ ym@@ aps for each channel and one instrument . you only need to use several Ke@@ ym@@ aps only in the first row .
Ke@@ ym@@ ola are used primarily to make tones on the percussion @-@ channel . check out as an example the Ke@@ ym@@ ph .
this section can be used to convert some channels to other . if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply make it easy in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you are using the Key@@ map option , the corresponding key@@ map must naturally be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are igno@@ red on this channel . in this case you will always use patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio indicates , in which ratio of pitch Ben@@ der events can be multiplied by the value n , this is used with the formula * ( r / 4096 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 4096 is used thus in the Map file no dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is used because GM is giving that a pitch Ben@@ der event is to play with the value 4096 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some keyboards up to one octave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI settings . you will find the Settings menu on Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cl@@ avi@@ bers you can see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument onto a particular channel . if you have changed a instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to display that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played tones . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . for example , if you will find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about it like a music piece . it contains the music , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can forcing you to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer . you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ge ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid . that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t desire to add all the files separately .
understood , therefore &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
before , activate the setup Automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can download the arrow button to the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to double the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid . in this way I have to play an MIDI file ( if I like a kar@@ aoke file play ) or don &apos;t want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; - windows switch and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
when you want to listen to a file just once you want to add a file , turn the setting Automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection of added files
for example , suppose you want to play MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ thy . so please insert the setup Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ des your temporary collection , then exactly this is a MIDI file .
then join the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to capture and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen these songs or the postcard , animated me to continue on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;ve studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ine ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of leisure for my hob@@ bies , but I try to give me a bit time . as Hob@@ bies I have program to collect MIDI files , music and play sets .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me really a huge , if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file of a local group . you will receive a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact a MIDI file , you should contact with me since I might have the file .
I have a &amp; k@@ mid . I wrote &amp; k@@ mid . I would like to get money in my leisure time . I would like to do this , because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the lack of the error to high the pitch in AW@@ E cards .

and of course my thanks again applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke @-@ files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage can be found , which is found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , search information and see images . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use an FM radio or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs if you might have any sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from the player or phon@@ o supported formats , and to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ last name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
for additional help please check out The K@@ DE website on new releases or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from the so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always a window with the central view . and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is returned to it .
it is possible to specify preferred links under the menu . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played by each other , you should use the category thum@@ b playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional Hier@@ archi@@ ved , if you want an entry , his group and all its sub@@ sets are copied to the current category and start playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ bs can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ max , click on the menu View and next processing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , the XML content of this section is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to choose from the menu on the same with playlist and select either the processing mode or select another category .
all changes go lost if the processing mode is left or another group is selected without removal of playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at starting and pressing can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and chang@@ er &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ taining option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , you can simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player , the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / / .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would dis@@ rupt the application at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; D ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; LT ; / t ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing the M@@ Player configuration dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ Mozilla .
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; c@@ tur@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; flash &apos; can play back in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player has to be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the application dialog file assign@@ ments for K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consoles application and release error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end is stored inside &amp; c@@ ms ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus , a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime Type is taken ( of course only if this also has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on to play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV maps , either by player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner must be configured to use and TV channels . furthermore , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog box to use - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ V1 . there should be detected , from which one will be selected ( for example , PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name has probably contained a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ video , X@@ Video will also work ( only the one that works out of video devices under Linux ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functional for the X server . therefore , this configuration file must therefore be contained in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , the KM@@ Player used for the sources are different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ des , t@@ v@@ source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ag@@ source . when enabled , they start playing with the playlist .
are you aware of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not of the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root according to the connection of the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom appears on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts slowly on why , every time my CPU needs to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the final stored value , only the first time is needed to check the CPU usage .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user areas and network support and will be needed for comp@@ iling &amp; valves ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional air preparation application . under Unix such systems it is probably based on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux ; distribution included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation disc should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some compiled pack@@ ets of &amp; c@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; web page included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly be read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding documentation . is the support for this project or its documentation , the contact should be made using the k@@ ile ; website .
any questions or compilation of &amp; c@@ rop@@ es ; or , or extensions , it should be addressed to ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; n@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for &amp; k@@ icking ; possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical user interface and within this simple , direct and custom access inside the source text and transformation tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assist@@ ent , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the mighty project management .
in order to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start working there directly with the reading of the chapter of Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right accommodation is : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . w@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ly the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a loader ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; even less demanding but more realistic setting is that it comes from Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
here it is not a good review to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book with this . um B. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other interpre@@ ting languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the gener@@ alization features are defined as paper format , page number@@ ing and text pages , the introduction starts at least the instruction \ \ Beg@@ in { deposits } and must be closed with the \ \ post { bil@@ lets } .
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a detailed function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibility for creating the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
document classes : this will be provided by the type of the create document : articles ( article ) , Book &#91; report &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ v@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , and Custom .
coding : hereby the character encoding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . best , use UTF @-@ 8x ( to correct processing the &amp; lat@@ ex ; - documents ) .
this list contains the mostly used accessories for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they have only to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used for creating German texts .
new users can now be wor@@ ried about . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about it will be presented in the section .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is still possible to discover that any mathematical environment could not be closed . however , it is due to the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is due to the emphasis on time and loading .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically creates a idle line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu setting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; Conc@@ erning the document of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ tle the lowest element ) :
at the view of the document in the structure of the structure , the individual elements can be changed and viewed on the appropriate button .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be found very helpful . once a DVI ; file was created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer for the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is available in addition to PDF the appropriate output type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , transformation , and print from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ching @-@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor were clicked , the exact opposite is shown in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . the prec@@ urs@@ or search is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , it is used for the respective passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer calls .
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified using other plug@@ ged .@@ tex files . when using a project , a large Master document can be set up for project developers .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and automatically displayed ( if no error occur in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode the DVI ; file on the bar@@ ge â it is going to show up . and there is not a call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction .
considering the processing tool bar the three large selection areas should be formulated . the selection areas have been developed for rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ i@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field Additional information is for individual products such as words , joints , notes , or references . the available options are :
designation : with this command you will find a designation for a section , a picture or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified designation ( selection above a selection box ) .
when using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can be easily written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ mer@@ it is used for the definition of the font . it can be defined for the main text , the joints , etc . , there are the following font size available :
2 selection criteria for creating a new document are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written down by reason .
the cl@@ amps according to the \ \ docum@@ ent@@ ate class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . the font is not specified at the beginning , this may also happen in the text .
once the above @-@ mentioned source code , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this purpose is the use of the menu of construction or button construction .
the source code must be stored prior to the compilation . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
finally , the compilation of the document command should be searched in the log file after errors . when using fast construction should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log should also be considered .
an area ( English ) is a text that is described differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and then only a few south look . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { A } , \ \ , and \ \ end { appart@@ ement } so then called the extension of the font .
the changes will be super@@ vised within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { A } to \ \ end { Extra } ) . there is no restrictions ( numbers ) for the surrounding modifications within one area .
there are many possibility to increase the legi@@ bility of the legi@@ bility and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , sub@@ cut@@ ters , etc. are added to the end of the environment . these commands are either associated with the \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long until he is closed with a \ \ end { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be applied to \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is illustrated , a step @-@ by @-@ step instruction for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assistant a bit text was entered , a few custom@@ ization for the better read@@ ability of the document should be done , some places in the grease and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor via editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E . during an external viewer , the window will be closed .
as soon as the DVI ; file created , the document can printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and enjoy fun .
DVI ; is an unusual file format ( English , V e V ice I n@@ uns ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps are possible to create a document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed on a file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar is the conversion of DVI ; file in different formats . once the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text can be created , the conversion into wav@@ ed other formats by means of key heads in the tool@@ bar .
to download the previous position within the DVI @-@ file , you can find the previous post in DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . only one of these must be setup possibilities ... tool@@ ing balanced .
to search for the prec@@ urs@@ or search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source image and clicked on the way to the respective spot in the DVI ; we will then apply .
using this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece : used with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; file the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; file size &amp; drop ; available in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor are defined as text editor ( editor )
should the use of quick@@ ening the &amp; DVI ; cannot be found , an error can be pre @-@ installed . should an error occur , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file causes the error source in the source code . in the Editor , the log file is always used across the errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the log file has to be clicked on the error in the log file , navig@@ ating to the faul@@ ty line .
as soon as you click the button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the available template for the document . the pre @-@ set mapping is :
a document can be written either from the basis of an empty document or the assistant to the fast preparation of a new document . further information are included in the section .
user @-@ based users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be saved , stored , and loaded to make the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file . create a new template by means of an existing document and create a document from document ... Create .
when creating a new document , a new document can be replaced by a file , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character code ) . these variables are configured in Settings ... General settings .
when creating the own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by the variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ ON OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this drawing chain is replaced by the input in document class . typically , they are following : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ ate class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ AL OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { &quot; } } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the related onset of the commands in the editor . once the document has been made in this way m@@ Ã ¼ s@@ sen completed the following steps :
when creating a new document , the own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and will be carried out under the steps below .
&amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ es of many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out directly from &amp; c@@ ile ;
to learn more about &amp; Kate . to learn more about Kate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; users can be used directly with the reading of the chapter on Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains an exceptional description of almost all commands that are found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use c@@ ubs and their syntax .
double click with a straight C@@ tr@@ l button to increase the &amp; tex ; word to w@@ it . this means that in this way , when clicking on \ \ par with \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when drawing the text with a twi@@ sted left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted transition , parts of the source text in the editorial window will be selected .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the various types of source texts and these particular . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex distinguish themselves ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be preserved . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ un@@ ches do not include the jump to n@@ igh@@ tly or last jump . this target will also highlighted the jump in the first input of a character .
the edit feature is probably one of the main aspects of using an program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already offers outstanding opportunities for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is always added ; special commands for their selection . under editing templates are the following commands to include the text @-@ selection :
w@@ asted a complete sub@@ section ( group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended significance does not make a text with continuous lines ( e.g. in other passages ) . the only illustrated thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; this means that the only thing is separated by two empty lines .
w@@ ed the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also added an extended meaning as this command is also a lateral cup ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to enjoy a part of the document , it can be removed and by pressing the key . &amp; Kate . offers the key collection C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers with own commands for a faster result . under editing are the following commands to read the text :
a complete sub@@ section . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to the edit sections .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; hur@@ ry ; for further orders under editing environment for a single @-@ grade work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
using this command is placed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the order for the opening of the environment .
using this command is placed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } , it will be used towards the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many spar@@ ed environmental commands , this command can quickly lost the overview of the surrounding area . this command was close to the last environment , so that the surrounding ambient structure is not z@@ om@@ itted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by cl@@ amps ... } . under the do Te@@ X group there are some important commands that origin@@ ate from machining environment .
using this command is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
using this command is placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the soft cl@@ utch of a &amp; tex ; group # is , to other end of the group calls ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a large group of group@@ ed groups can quickly lost the mountain views . this command was close to the last , so that the ach@@ ute structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not z@@ om@@ itted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy beginn@@ er signs used to be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple start@@ up signs . also for the proof of the initial survey , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close beginn@@ er signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double start number can be set under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and then turn out .
there are also special settings ( such as n@@ pi@@ g or French ) and thus the German or French beginn@@ er sign . there are also many other languages supported .
when used for shi@@ fting Shift ; input buttons for an intelligent int@@ ent break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line break , but also the command \ \ item .
shut down &amp; n@@ ile within a tables setting ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an an@@ gled line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to emphas@@ ize the pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to emphas@@ ize it . they can be added to the La@@ Te@@ X .
some users choose the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) ; seek &amp; hur@@ ry ; try to ad@@ mon@@ ish this . although this tab@@ ulator is not so frag@@ ile , however , in some spaces for the columns of the current tab .
although &amp; Kate ; already provides a good source code for this , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; for specific commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) still extended . there are three different modes available for automatic adjustment . all these modes can be configured for different work@@ ings under Settings ... Do not be configured .
when you start a new environment using the \ \ Beg@@ in { setting } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { setting } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when selecting the road button , the last letter of the input will be removed and you can see the result list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , these descriptions are av@@ al@@ igned for selecting a command . alternatively , jump up to these positions to the ski jumps N@@ Ã ¤ j@@ est dive brand can be opened and the remaining parameters will be opened .
with Settings c@@ ile ; sol@@ es ... k@@ ile ; complete things to be made with these lists . there are several different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and outputs of the general language used .
the command mode is suitable for use in environments not to have a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of default mode is used to have a large list with environmental conditions . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the alignment of environments .
when calling the conf@@ ession mode , the menu entry is automatically adapted to the extent of the environment , or the key collection , the command to the extent of the environment can be obtained automatically and it appears with \ \ Beg@@ in . afterwards , the environment can be in the easiest way and can be completed by pressing the input button .
after this process is finished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; hur@@ ry ; recogni@@ zes that it is a lists environment , it is even a first \ \ item command with incoming search .
with Settings c@@ ile ; rop@@ es ... k@@ ile ; complete secret settings on this lists can be made . this mode is used for comparison list mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; under@@ score custom entries of ab@@ brevi@@ ations , which are immediately subst@@ it@@ uted by l@@ g@@ ging strings . the lists can be adjusted ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l containing the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l containing the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L was entered and the word comp@@ uted by the volume of the menu + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large , but it is not helpful for automatic adjustment in a document more than once . thus , &amp; hur@@ ry ; the ful@@ fill@@ ment for all of them have already been written .
this mode can be buff@@ ered in the menu ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sat@@ ile versions . here , the sw@@ elling value for displaying the verification can be specified .
the verb@@ al files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / the Persian Home folder . mode is available for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( translator ) or tex .
the dialog for graphics has been specially designed for graphics as easy as possible . to view the basis of the graphic formats , sections and observ@@ ations should be considered .
PS -@@ files are not known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for signs and new orders of pages . if the PDF output files are newly built and then the PDF output files are newly ordered and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf file .
in order to learn the results of the work , it must be compiled in the source text . all the tools are group@@ ed in the menu to create comp@@ ile , creating converting and creation .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other transformation can be used by a Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and can be viewed by a Alt ; 5 the PS @-@ file .
when using the command mode , a viewer can be called after comp@@ ile . if not a second viewer should be used , there will be a new window each time .
a new project will be asked about the menu New Project .... That the following information will be asked for the project :
when using the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for the evaluation of EC@@ MAS@@ K @-@ Ko@@ de . scripts are contained in the scripts in the vertical strip .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; c@@ ile ; yet .
as a first one must have been said that the export environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; an object @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinctive system where the basic functions can be expanded through a variety of additional packages , providing a lot of different help to under@@ stands the users .

this is a fully developed Re@@ fern@@ es for &amp; tex ; and it is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for search of a specific form@@ att@@ ing . as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with them &amp; tet@@ ex ; / textile mer@@ ited ; the final document is not always easy . as m@@ ful help , &amp; Tet@@ ex works ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database including all to &amp; k@@ ile ; used in documents and here for a graphic surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or impact images . of &amp; c@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the living space , the viewer is open for the document .

the version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; all of these tools are used as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as under@@ stand@@ able . the combination makes fast , efficient , full and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has thought about pro@@ c and how exc@@ essive it is . we &apos;ll take it a piece , we give it a graphical user ! no longer click on a terminal ; simply click on the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ s can be attached to the current file folder . if not , then remove the selection of up @-@ known folders and type them in the field of other folders to the desired folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted once every time .
as already said , anyone who has been working on &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical user surface for it .
if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then you can simply choose the current file folder . if not , then select up the current file folder and give them the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found .
when it comes to an output from the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported error and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; then it is simply plug@@ ged in &amp; quantitative . if not , delete the file using current file , select the file using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well is well located , click the Well @-@ formed dialog .
for use of an &amp; D@@ TD , which is specified in &amp; XML ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is required , the specification of the defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; in file selection are required .
yes , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the processed file in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; already marked , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file selection file using the other file file selection .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative cap@@ l@@ us ; you may have a little bit to do . thereby , you can benefit from the additional functionality and need not wait until someone can be used in &amp; quantitative ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can find further below .
in order to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin with the &quot; plug@@ ins &quot; menu . thus the following dialog will open :
this dialog allows to manage all plug@@ ins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search engine . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this path leads to the search of the plug @-@ ins .
many people work in any kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team manager and sub@@ project leader .
the user can search for even from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates that it is . this is done by looking for the team member from the list and the button s@@ me@@ ats as ex@@ presses . the currently selected member ( its identification ) will appear after you are : text .
top names and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see further information on remarks .
besides the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the team : it can be created a event for information to the team manager if a particular item is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that happen if something specific is done in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project so that later , how much som@@ eb@@ ody is being backed by , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S once they will be added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the receiver list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i such conductors are set up .
ann@@ ot@@ ations are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note that note is simple . it can be selected either by the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation Key@@ word in a commentary area followed by An@@ qui@@ ext text .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be submitted to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager of Head of Sub@@ project guides You should be given the respective scope and sub@@ project names , as in the examples below .
top names and roller names are independent of large or small an@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation but spaces around the brackets and the note : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ ati@@ zation , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be addressed via settings Quant@@ a ... called . Dies@@ er@@ dialog extends over some pages that will be treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . entries are :
large / Classi@@ fication of tags : large / small statement of automatically attached tags . normal large / small statement , the tags are added so inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small statement of attributes : large / small statement of automatically enclosed at@@ ters . normal large / small boxes are added , the attributes are added so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags : automatically shut down : when attached , it is optional for tags , for the closing day is optional , added immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional Tags automatically shut up : as above all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and end day automatically upgrade : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic reset of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the corresponding coding during inser@@ ting .
M@@ ime Type : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using the standard , the default pre@@ set can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way open to open files ( where the encoding of the file can be transmitted ) . however , this setting will be em@@ itted by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting will be em@@ itted by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; creates a regularly backup copy or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document of this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for other stored documents , a backup will be created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter ) what it is possible to watch the documentation , preview and source text simultaneously .
set the shut@@ ting settings on the default to the next start is useful if the user interface have come through simpli@@ fication of the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves to the tax of the possibility to de@@ activate the display of war@@ nings by in@@ h@@ uts of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the display of symbols rather than the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text in divided mode . regarding the various modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the appropriate action by clicking on the structure of the structure .
in the area of structural tree @-@ settings , the visibility of knots in tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree is automatically set to be set automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found , where there are no element found in the current document .
the area for fixing the ab@@ brevi@@ ation of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , this means a valid Group can be added to PHP in which the i@@ f@@ og@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different means a group valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part of the third page that can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins there must be the following :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not in a standard resort like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is presented to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ harvest &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to store when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , test@@ is &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; if the required information is correct . please choose the store also if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting was completely redesigned . the support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of whose , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept is implemented that allows different implem@@ entations to plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for using &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
the use of the de@@ bug for a project starts with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the button options next to the monitor plug @-@ in setting , the specific settings can be changed .
when a project is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . will usually appear in the left dock .
a view where all mounting points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . is usually in the lower dock .
a view where the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug is shown . is usually used in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on de@@ bug requirements . this promotion will be triggered by default if a project is used , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger must not be counted on it .
the counter piece on deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the listen to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and the currently loaded line . if this happens when the script has started , the version will start before a deb@@ ug@@ gets started , the script will start with the request .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script file , without information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script has been given , the version will start as soon as a request will start .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next directive in the script , whereby it is possible to include in functions and include files .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go up and go to the next so , than there would be the current not .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be super@@ vised . the monitored value appears in the vari@@ en@@ side view .
with this dialog , a variable set or a new value can be set to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of K@@ eit@@ h Is@@ dale , like this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that it can be found on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of K@@ eit@@ h .
this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize and custom@@ ize how to custom@@ ize your needs and how to help you create &amp; quantitative .
documentation type Ed@@ iting packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative representation ; help support for aw@@ ning and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you can enable &amp; quantitative representation ; their simplicity and flexibility make up &amp; quantitative ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web use , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the script languages and / CSS ; s contain two data types , the tag folder , and the tool@@ bars . day folders are hand@@ ful , symbo@@ li@@ ous bodies of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions qu@@ icker into a document than a user may .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be rendered manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; as@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ alog@@ ical , the &amp; quantitative data ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow a fast delivery of tags in a document without risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag folder are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; ear@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have better viewing and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations are explained in simple manner .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur in one document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains no @-@ element type over itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( Family 2 )
only valid for the conference type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( Family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . specifies the name of the class , where this method belongs to . ( Family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attributes and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; LT ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only be found once for each attri@@ bute . additionally , there is the name and type of attri@@ bute . additionally , there are additional tags that will be displayed , such as this attri@@ bute is meant &amp; etc . this is an only element type element .
gives the source codes used for the filling in the day editorial dialog and At@@ tri@@ butes tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ name within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a chi@@ oring and a method@@ ologies . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . may empty its or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
one container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur at a attri@@ bute description only once . it is an element type element .
the position of attributes can be fixed within a dialog within a dialog . this day can occur at any attri@@ bute within a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; - day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for any field in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags : this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that termin@@ ate one day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files need to begin with one &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt . ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ pped and closed .
no spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; D ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; LT ; tool@@ bag &gt; , &amp; l@@ t. ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and have no leg , but some pieces of the work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog will start in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; windows to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , checking only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; LT ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a working family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Excel function is described . the file name of this daily XML file is to be over@@ load .@@ day .
I &amp; LT ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 , encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load type = &quot; function = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; LT ; / day &gt;
the &amp; ref@@ usal r@@ c ; file is also pretty easy and there is a editor that can be selected via D@@ TD edit &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be prepared for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be prepared with following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = used for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD ( / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a Nick@@ name .
a action can be fixed with Settings ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
this can be assigned to this promotion . with clicking on the user button a key name can be assigned to the one button .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful shareholder type . using this promotion , external applications ( usually such as scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; yourself are the quick start @-@ dialogue or the different See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
as first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to find the % skri@@ pt@@ est while command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we have replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of local document needed file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; trial . if by &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; by external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the above @-@ mentioned methods there is a script entries of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; at the default setting . input field dialog can be determined , which is to be sent to the default entry options . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the issued application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal issue , printed on the standard error Edition . error messages can be done by the default output written by clicking the value field issue :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the case there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select Settings Ac@@ tions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action Kn@@ op@@ t at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and when the day attributes and you can plan their use , activate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignore ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; check ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used as standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit tags .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting head as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ alized a message to user , click on this symbol no &amp; lt ; -@@ day in current document include .
after creating the symbol , it must still be linked to the action . this happens on the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the required action . besides the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and reset them with other tags , so there are still what there are , or confirm with OK to finish .
suppose you want some usual &amp; quantitative cap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool bar supplement or it should adjust it to better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog for Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to pick the Tren@@ to ( at the top right ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I want to preview for example a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the Tren@@ to support the group . anyone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; push the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by st@@ ating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it becomes im@@ bal file , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right file . please custom@@ ize their tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; quantitative extension ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ation language , which would like it . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ entation &apos; for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you may review in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ fication / script / etc . -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we do not need to treat the doc@@ r@@ c file here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = Path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Your description for these docum@@ entations such as &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = ( 1.@@ html html 1 = landmark 1.@@ html ) 2 = func@@ tion@@ 2 = func@@ tionally tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree defined the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation like something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Links PHP 4.2 Exhibition = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = par@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that it concerns the sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess player ( except of Re@@ ason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out .
note that the contents of the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent@@ ally , at the top end of the building site &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is shown ! ) .
no spaces influence nothing , but keep on &amp; down ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; D ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; res@@ sources can be replaced .
the content section is the area of doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to appear in context of a &amp; PHP ; scripts for the context of a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connectors .
a simple list of suitable context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ s doc@@ r@@ c to store up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Me / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / editing / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / editing / apps or bps for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ et@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are certain that these are well and it &apos;s worth , you will send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; community . they will not be rich , but proud of them being involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to distribute the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an Email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive of where all the other &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication , for what it is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP keys . this means that our team is ensured , both our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) or in the case that you have several keys , you can proceed in a dialog box New resource ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking on OK the load can be started .
the upload can also be Up@@ load from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool@@ bars tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the scripts and scripts tree started .
after downloading of a resource , still using &amp; quantitative ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity were given with signature , a message appears with speci@@ fying the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet able to work by a D@@ T@@ EP package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the sim@@ pler way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion is possible from the D@@ TD loading and convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE defin@@ itions : the strings written in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
precision adjustment of D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; ref@@ usal r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; there are several key concepts . to be able to understand and make full advantage of &amp; quantitative concept . this chapter tries to create them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , local and projection . these differentiation affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are for everyone who is using &amp; quantitative ; uses , available . of tool bars over actions are all that is marked with a common folder of &amp; quantitative patterns ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators to secure different tools , actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development equipment for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in a user directory , so that they can use only this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . all elements can be made specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction work , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and further information about these areas .
you can click the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter with the right button of mouse to re@@ load a context menu with the current Document which pass@@ able , delete or upload the document , ski@@ p to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click here to add a further context menu regarding the updated document content , such as basic processing steps ( copy / copy / insert ) , edit the file under mouse poin@@ ter or Open the file , if the string is described under mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor , the tool@@ bars of the editor are currently representing &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bars is displayed . in the course of the expansion of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , the tool bar will be adapted to the new features and thus related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really light . if they want to insert it into a single day , then click the icon to insert the day . now , you should insert the data for this just entered . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ) allow it to open and navigate in the information about &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us . in the representation of cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite are available for files , project , templates , docum@@ ent@@ aries , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative files ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right mouse click . promotions such as removing , upload , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depend on &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; working range starting . global templates are always available , local templates for the appropriate users and templates are only available in the project . more about templates are available .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of re@@ integration into the global , location and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can download the right information on a script , such as the script will start to process , edit or send it with an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is displayed on the position of the element . by right clicking on an element , a list of commands to navigation and collection of the tree opens .
this tree appears under other construction sites . with it , man@@ go attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation about the web @-@ technique for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quantitative ; it is possible to create custom documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quantitative ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the use@@ able information : the message window and the problem windows .
this cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite shows information about each in quant@@ um script script . so , for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this cart@@ ei@@ ite shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; quantitative cap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you get the appropriate command . the chocolate of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
a further function of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can secure them in &amp; using a tool@@ bar in an email ; how to backup and load them !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the location of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; it has auto@@ conf a number of options to get to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help one . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have any problems with starting &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folders . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative web development has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during effort , the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; quantitative cap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an independent , extended aw@@ up languages ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . merge : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; quantitative ; this will be the suitable &amp; IDE disk .
well , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be said that &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ ers is not only possible ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ or is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand , as they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative cap@@ l@@ us ; enables web development to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can be increased dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itting actions , scripts and tool bars , it can be extended by using a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more on this you will find in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast we@@ aving and has been developed quickly to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quantity ; the original developers left the GPL license version and produced a commercial program .
to obtain more details about the details : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; quantity is currently developed and serves as Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ ti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time if you open a file , which is not located on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . check out the section on templates . you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project leader .
convert from inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; statement , so that it displays properly and do not refer to the browser as a form@@ att@@ ing assignment .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; statement that the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . in first line to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches to or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages gives !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined ex@@ pressing to help you .
shows the message window , or not an . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
problem and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated , once you turn to the structural tree .
shows the symbols @-@ old links from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when the book@@ marks are in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries fore@@ most or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project of hard disk . &amp; quantitative cap@@ l@@ us ; projects are being stored with the Extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory according to new files that could be there . that allows for example graphics files to copy in your project folder , or to add a sub@@ folder and then add to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; further details are explained .
loads a project certificate . these will be kept in the project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have allocated to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only created the name . promotions are to store through Settings ... added . tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bars and are asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the visual field . this does not delete them from hard disk . if you don &apos;t have saved the tool bar , you will ask if you want to do this .
with this you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so the tool bar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main erv@@ er , where anyone can access any other . see .
to load a &amp; D@@ TD , which you are made or anything else and convert to the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; own label format .
ref@@ res@@ h / ref@@ res@@ h the re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is meaning@@ ful if the re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to renew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is not available and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file does not fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu option that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ men@@ s .
activ@@ ates or disabled the intelligent insertion of tags . currently this works only work with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; quantitative representation is denied if this day is contra@@ cted in this place the rules .
plug @-@ ins in the plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu points . click on button . click on a activated plug @-@ plug@@ in .
select the syntax of syntax for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms used to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate switching between the various types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch is sometimes e@@ ager@@ ly need or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the box mode , which is also the default setting , or the lower window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for every open @-@ window . using a presentation , the corresponding window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog accounts every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
the behavior of the editor is one . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . it is available for details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which you can change and follow the series .
that should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project , developers can always use the help . if they want to support &amp; quantitative Form ; development in financial form you will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , since e.g. , after filling the project name , the whole list structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information may later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg . f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you can use this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol is used . depending on the remote control it could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . when a joint collection of files will be used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) one must go different .
check @-@ in if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project started from scratch on a new one , not h@@ aken .
with this option , all files and folders will be shown within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to th@@ inn@@ ings .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by plug@@ ins or , by removing the check box , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three adjustments which can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu pane with project Project Properties in the bottom window profiles or with the ch@@ ecker Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some adjustments are described in the project assist@@ ants and are described in the process . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are re@@ inv@@ oked in project @-@ related operations like the project folder .
the supplem@@ entary option can be listed above , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project can be loaded when opening the project . more about project views can be read .
this means that the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed is found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be adjusted using the check@@ box . in case the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is described .
in the bottom window profiles can also be set up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction view for each profile , by using an own construction view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the lower @-@ window event , one can switch event actions and modify these promotions , change or delete all events . event operations are executed if a previously specified event appears , like the sick@@ ness of a file . see details .
by default , quantitative &amp; quantitative ; the last project which was opened . this behaviour is currently not influence .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the icon Project will open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will open and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file is automatically saved , if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative files are found . the same happens if you download a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder is also provided , but are missing the entries and opening with the right mouse button on the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows the removing of the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button is cut off to avoid the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and if you forgot at a program . this option is useful if you need to upload files needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the plate is not available .
that will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; many high load profiles can be created and so the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing and create a profile will be displayed this dialog :
this is the name of the server where the files should be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator , one service does not operate at the usual port .
depending on your anxi@@ ety , it is either a tim@@ es@@ aving function or danger . use it to your discretion . the password will be stored on the plate , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming language can easily see it in clear text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it may be possible in a project a lot of views , i.e. by easy exchange of view , and replace various files and tool@@ bars and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool bar , att@@ ain@@ able via settings of tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; to which one can do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working methods .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; best via the tool@@ bar tool@@ bars . use and add up . Adding tool bar will be handled at the section adding tool bar .
the tool@@ bars and symbols are set to be set either by using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , there may be different actions such as tool bar , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , what can be specified in the dialogue , which may be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action updated which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and promotions to them can set up in the menu with Settings ... and Settings Settings ... .
templates are essential document labels , code @-@ es@@ cal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the existing folder made available in the previous tree . designs have shown in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations listed for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions on the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; binary templates are normally inserted in documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the advance tree of a global templates . further information on templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to make efficient . some examples can be found in the advance tree under global templates . see more information on templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a whole menu on a JavaScript or Perl basis . some examples are in the advance tree below global templates . see more information on templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be summarized in a folder plate archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As template to save as local template .
as soon as it is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out the tree structure under project templates .
select text in your document and select File as template . alternatively , select the selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and arrange on the constructions template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a previous file . it can be used to use all file management functions such as pulling down or insert on the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder icon or create a folder icon to create a folder on the right and site template . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it is also stored as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and dynamic with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or linked with them . in addition , some things in use of templates in projects are very deep @-@ found in mind .
the template structure in the basement window is based on the files used in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / templates / apps . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to define the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as a ter@@ most attri@@ bute is inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fits all apart from the common folders . if a trunk can be adjusted so , it would be explicitly enabled in this path . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is probably in a common file .
forward or shown text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or under@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a file with special head@@ lines / foot lines a whole presentation with matching head@@ lines / feet lines .
in addition , we have the context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites you to edit a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and run as needed for source code editor , in which the carried out changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit the V@@ oh@@ and@@ eli from &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavi@@ oral behaviour .
the second mode is just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are synchron@@ ously running . using F9 this mode is already active , the key pressure of the active cur@@ sor from a window to others where the position is maintained in the document .
the sync distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a .... In addition , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation is valid for quick calcul@@ ator and a large range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the title of the website . this is also called the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also change it :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing two buttons at the bottom , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word Key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design your pages in the browser . it is possible to add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . an amendment on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to integrate a external CSS style template by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a word processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally safe . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by plug@@ ging and extingu@@ ished by button or distances .
the insert of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source code editor . it is necessary to note that the tags have already been added to existing tags , e.g. an anchor day , which is inserted with text , must be removed every other surrounding anchor per day .
some tool bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ assistant are disabled . you will later be used in &amp; V@@ PL ; work on this release shall be used for tables or lists tools .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of sty@@ li@@ stic templates . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ lists , search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style can be tra@@ ced .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why so &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribution made many changes and simultaneously correc@@ tions the obj@@ ection . another programmer had changed in the same file a lot of text . the result were numerous conflicts during meeting .
the program used by me did not show me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the inclusion of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; could represent differences in one line and changes to white characters . later there were added a lot of further useful features .
for example , if you would like to compare text quickly , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the reference windows .
a function which did a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently in one piece of co@@ d and make changes . the merge editor will show the resolution of conflicts and shows the outcome . in this Editor , you can even edit the outcome . this screen saver shows three Qu@@ ell files to merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; helps you the same and complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; at the folder meeting :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; displays the accurate differences and di@@ stra@@ ight@@ forward the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check this function , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed clearly . if rows are distinguished only in a certain number of white characters , you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore , if no one changes the deposit . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ p@@ work easier by writing only the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual entry of file names , the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select one of the last opened file from the list box . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file , if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
over the button folder ... you can also choose a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge files will be selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
if you inter@@ sec@@ ts , the input field is active and is not necessary . however , it is not necessary to specify a output file immediately . you can also do this step later while saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active reference window . the comparison starts to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with button 1 button .
you can also use pulling and shut@@ down : move a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall above a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes you would like to figure out how many similar functions . if you would need to figure out how similarly these functions are , would have to compare it in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; load and compare these relevant sections . now , you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can extract nothing from &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; remove only the bul@@ let of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and placing text into another program as a cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains characters A , B or C , the file names and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional ) . ( if the path leads to a file , you can rest the mouse over the line . then a little aid window will show the full name . )
the three sour@@ dough are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , you can see the color that file is different . if both files differ is the default color for this red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( merge ) .
left in addition to the text is the Com@@ preh@@ ensive column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding colour . if white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are relevant only in strings and few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line that separates the Com@@ preh@@ ensive column of the text is interrupted by places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line turn is activated , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparative windows ) also has an info @-@ line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ert &#93; if you already have the result . normally , it contains the automatic compilation already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! through all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next dissolved / uns@@ ol@@ ved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , every difference at the same time has to be solved manually at the same time .
by a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( therefore , the group is then highlighted in the windows where the group is usually highlighted . ) This group is then highlighted by the color background color for the current area and on the left is a black beam .
sometimes , thanks to the automatic merge or by manual processing , no more line will remain in the group ; this text is only a plac@@ eholder for the case you can change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you may copy and add differently .
the text &amp; lt ; merge tiles ; however , appear in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if when selecting the sources the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or commentary are also treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates will navigate mainly to the image aff@@ ord and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , side , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . you can also click navig@@ ating even to the navig@@ ating system .
in the eye window , you can use the other buttons to do pane . using the Ins@@ ert button , you can switch between adjusting and transfer mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns is synchron@@ izing the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section assembly and the ed@@ itable output window was declared ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all dis@@ sol@@ uble conflicts must still be regarded as conflict . therefore , between sol@@ ving and uns@@ ol@@ ved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this is enabled , you can select the copying files automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . however , be careful if you could see the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ rol@@ s are stored in accordance with the included operating system \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + c@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ ce \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line files of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the last files used are automatically stored and re@@ produced in the next start . ( menu items &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a script of fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog displays writings with variable width available , but you should not use it . )
if you dis@@ able this option , differences in curve sequences are displayed . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered . on these systems , the button settings will automatically display an un@@ conditional color .
when this option is enabled , the tab key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
if you enter or return Return , the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copying the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be igno@@ red in the source files . only in this step , white characters can be igno@@ red . in this step , white characters will not igno@@ red in this step . also , white characters are not igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) storing a car folder &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then you could store files with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , however , when this option is activated , however , this option will be disabled . during the result , this option is de@@ activated .
the default setting is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; ) are igno@@ red in the result , the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
the default setting is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically ski@@ p mode , this setting is determined how long the results of the selection will be displayed , before the next turn of the next conflict is passed .
dis@@ solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by choosing the chosen file as source . ( default is useful if white characters are used in many files less important . if you need only from time to time , use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments .
these options are handled in chapter to scanning for folders and announ@@ cing a merge . see details below documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version contains the suff@@ ix .@@ original , if already a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , this is deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not require the current program . you need to exit &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; finish and rest@@ art if the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set to the control center globally . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , for all entries the upper setup is used .
in the selection fields for the encoding is a short notice that the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and have an inform@@ al character . )
custom@@ ize the file coding for source files . this means how special characters is treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding .
for example , if you have a file , you can define which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define the processing line , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files might handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output files .
switch off to in@@ hibit the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or over@@ look . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or reviews if the options have to ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color @-@ coded over@@ lay column are displayed . but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; B ; C , A &amp; B &amp; D ; C , C is still indicated in addition to the normal still a second transformer column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply cut off the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
specifies the comparison chart by side or superior to each other . this can also be useful to ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files . a simple click starts to merge and uses the file names of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , you will first pass through this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ dat@@ or , which is exactly your needs . you can extract this function e.g. to extract inter@@ rupt parts or for correct use .
when reading a file , it is specified first to this external command . if also a standard pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when input is equal . you can write your own pre@@ dat@@ or , which corresponds to your needs . every input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow more flexibility when entering the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program the good . the good news is , however , that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line cross@@ ings to input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ent expression of the printed text on each string . the \ \ 1 is moved on the found text in the first cl@@ ung . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other compression control systems use some key words to include automatically generated character ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern is $ \ &apos; \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with SE@@ D , you might be able to understand it and perhaps you may have this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ uses . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is one suitable matches , and each hits will be slightly deleted .
sometimes you may need to perform multiple constra@@ ints at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; you can use the conditions from each other . example :
instead SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; allergi@@ es are different from per@@ l some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the lead \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be kept for displaying and to maintain . further operations change only the data that the line @-@ like @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences , you can not see certain differences , and in the worst case you will destroy important data .
often you have to edit the programm@@ ers in a folder of files . from this reason , you can compare and merge together with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... making a proposal for any object ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal in front of the start ,
... can simul@@ ate simul@@ ate and show the simul@@ ated changes without them ,
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you only need to open file on the command line or the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target file is specified , used &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to press the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform a little message about the recent progress . if you ab@@ rupt the folder of the folder , only the files will be listed , which have been compared to that time .
if the scanning of the folder is finished , shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a listing window with the results on the left , ...
any file and each folder that has been found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded . you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - button . the directory menu contains two functions All sign@@ atories are folding and all sub@@ directories can be folded if you can open all the folders or fold .
when double click on a file , the file comparison starts and it appears a reference window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in different folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object . in such a case the comp@@ res@@ hr action can not be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as in the above picture you can see in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , the colour is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if you are full content . then you have the same color . at folder is the age un@@ pleasant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf that &apos;s first green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red will be red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A is not found , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. , if a file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the result cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. , if a file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the result cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ising is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target file are synchron@@ ised and if the option may synchron@@ ize directories . then select &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the necessary action , so follow both folders . if you want an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copies &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. sol@@ ving such bugs can &apos;t be removed , the merge file cannot be started .
during bringing a file after the other hand , the status column shows distance , if the merge operation was successful , and according to other messages , if the merge has been completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is right in order .
if using the dialog for Full @-@ comparative Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 is shown further columns . these contain the number of un@@ le@@ vies , sol@@ uble , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts will be shown only if three folders compared to or merged . )
you can either execute the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or any entries at once . if you have selected all the inter@@ cep@@ ot actions ( even in all sub @-@ gath@@ er@@ ings ) , you can start coll@@ ision .
please note : if you have not specified any target file , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C it is used as target , when using two @-@ folder merge , B and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder correction . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ note tag ) . to merge only the current item : select action of the current element or press F6 .
if by conflic@@ ting file types still inv@@ alid , a message appears on the incorrect elements , and you can choose a valid action for them .
when you complete all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options to simul@@ ate and break the options .
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without the real changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then resol@@ ve certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge to a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select again directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , an appropriate dialog appears . then , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; appear on a mistake , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you can help you to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you have to ski@@ p the problem the cause of the problem or to solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , see &amp; diff@@ 3 ; those entries ( in the current session ) and does not execute all entries again . even if here the merge files are not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you complete the merge action , these entries will be re @-@ guided .
the Settings menu of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that fit the specified patterns will be displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholder . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default file size must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders also correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders also correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . plenty of aut@@ matic files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is made with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems you have a hiding place . in other file systems it is a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
for links to files : if the option is shut down , symbolic link values are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links below . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches . ( note that if the option contains a link to itself ) and go to diff@@ 3 ; dis@@ closes this option is switched off .
does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistic government . ( the number of sol@@ uble , un@@ ic@@ ast@@ eries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files which do not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare great folders through a slow network , it is possibly faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed should not be higher . please use caution . this option is activated in default .
similarly to the Change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered to be identical if they have lost equal . this option can be useful if when changing the chan@@ ges@@ et date . please do not use this option . this option is activated .
activ@@ iti@@ ze the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders compared and no destination folders . in this mode , the suggestions are identical . in this mode , the results are identical in both folders . this option is switched off in both folders .
if there are differences to merge the copying of the newer file as a action . ( this is considered un@@ certain because the other file is not changed too . you should check this option in any case . ) This option is switched off .
if a file or file is replaced by a different file or deleted , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original if an old backup file is already exists , this will also affect the normal interaction of individual files , not only the complete folders . this option is switched on .
normally , the folders merge view would be visible to the merge files ; you can switch the divider divider with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the option into the window menu and switch main window between directory and text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ click . however , there is a single file directly together without the folder . if you want to save the folder , the status will be done directly , and the file will not run again when you start the folder .
this status is however lost if you read the directory once again : directory menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote host .
the first line arrows compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second line arrows compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
one URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
a path can be relatively und@@ o or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is assumed as an link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change@@ ability date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change@@ ability date from the original ( please note the option of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as the differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the viewer viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a c@@ Part , decreases &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and choose from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work unless the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; as Part 2 , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Com@@ preh@@ ensive ) . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 has already pointed out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone these track or follow him .
you compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you can find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters occur differently , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if you &apos;ll be treated next to Each Other , this will show this . this is the case .
the editor register for every difference in the files where it starts and ends . that &apos;s necessary to save a conflict by clicking in the source text and select the Kn@@ op@@ t A / B / C . this important information is simply saved when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been so far too large . you can use a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit more large quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text , no sr@@ c left ; released and the text is not extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ use 3 ; already use many colors for creating differences . even more emphasis is conf@@ using and lacking the purpose . use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; you &apos;ll need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
you can find information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; use diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems when pil@@ ing . should nevertheless occur difficulties , report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists .
sealing ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ x or Shift Del@@ ete ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift to insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only differences in files : files that are identical in all folders can not appear in folder , and therefore not in target folder .
( in current version version , you need to update the folder to the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries indicated that the differences may not be copied to the target folders . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is probably amended in a later program version . ) This option is switched off .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they are removed when clicking on the button accordingly .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . normal differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the spaces to change their size or move them . this works both within a work area as well as in several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens , can display all virtual space areas as well as in the ongoing applications . the applications can be selected and even moving across the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; the movement is also possible in a work area as well as other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button has clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ens , click , the context menu has only used the two entries of p@@ ager . I clicked on the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , Up@@ on Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . it appears only if you click on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . it appears only if you click on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
when this field is crossed , will appear in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work areas are shown .
cross this field lets you see the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; numbers of virtual space surfaces . if it is crossed with name , the name will be with ordin@@ ate numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of every desktop will be shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the current programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work areas will be displayed to allow the selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the windows with the standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; the main window can be determined : classic , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , as well known as p@@ ager applications in some other windows . horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work areas in a vertical row , which is very good for the display on the side at the side .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature range in the Control bar . it has the advantage of changing the window as symbols or with its contents and post@@ p@@ one . furthermore , it runs outside the Control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; followed by selecting the switch ... allow the dialog for Settings .
currently , that cannot be changed in dialogue settings . however , you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ g . if you have no writing permission for the file , you need to register as user root or register to your system administrator . in this file , you need to specify the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and refer to this one value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is de@@ base , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fying . you can read with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen can read a magni@@ fying glass . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual deteri@@ oration . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very efficient application which is constantly expanding with new functions . it is optimised for use on performance weak machines .
when you see &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window will be called the magni@@ fication window .. The image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is a enlarged range of screen and is designated as a selection window .
in the default setting , it can be increased &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile le@@ ft@@ . alternatively , you can see &amp; k@@ may ; in addition , a selected screen pitch in the magni@@ fication screen ( select window ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on the screen side ( eg ; on the left screen deck ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the cur@@ sor position . please note that it is not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the select mode you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication panel and move it with the arrow keys .
if you are additionally the &amp; Shift ; press and push the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the select window will remain and just the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ likes ; possesses a lot of features . you can copy the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , the picture and much more .
starting or stops the ad update . the stops of the update causes that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , du@@ ing , medium , high ) . the higher the ref@@ res@@ h rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your introduced short command to store files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document again loading in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and shred@@ ders &amp; etc . ;
it can also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use a magni@@ fier to view it in a newspaper or a photo . this application is used for different people from use : from research or artist to the web designer or see .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( the repet@@ itive strain rate of ignition syndrome ) and each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool : em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is a little while on the same place . it &apos;s meant to help people that m@@ ating every mouse click pain . Moreover , it may cause them to em@@ ulate it with the mouse . this , however , requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool : can cope with pain , which is using the mouse , and helps to use the pain of pain without pain . unfortunately , if you are caused by the naked Move to the mouse , you should try to search a doctor if this is not yet happened .
to al@@ ise it even once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain which applies through the protection of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic user means , the result can be dropped out differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion shortly .
is smart moving activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break when it is pressed by pressing the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the to@@ es when pressed the mouse button . the smart moving requires a little practice , but you get used quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , this residence time must be taken before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exit .
is the contrary shi@@ fting unit , the setting panel shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting for off before the mouse button is waiting , if the mouse is still no moving because of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on foot . if this function activ@@ ates a slow motion to the right and back , followed by a break , click on the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt for the first time you can change it later .
when the sound is delayed , you can rip &amp; k@@ de ; do not move the response time . open there , sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the relevant documentation that will start automatically as you start a program .
all settings are set to the values which have been set when opening the dialog . you have already pressed the button to user , the settings are reset to the level after pressing the user .
best when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first use by default . especially the smart move should be switched off at first . if you are used to click the automatic mouse , you can later go the smart moving .
when you use the audi@@ ble click , it &apos;s necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; if you are using sounds .
first , you should be aware , in which places a mouse click with no effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on the browser window , which doesn &apos;t make link to un@@ certain reactions . you can park the mouse to such places until you want to use it .
if your mouse is pressed , you should clean your mouse , that &apos;s usually rather simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t only clean@@ se the mouse ball but also the roles you come with the mouse ball in touch .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . like this happens , is from mouse to mouse differently . it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
when you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles you can see . these are mounted on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just start an im@@ per@@ ation process . if you use the smart moving , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should stop the operation no longer through the let@@ ting of the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; below a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; returned and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries to execute &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the cur@@ sor at another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of mind if you do not want to make the mouse over a neutral position un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter and eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I do not make it to edit text .
the smart shift is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or want to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or want to move into any other promotion . however , there will probably be some problems to prepare . here are some advice on this :
just do not use the smart move , if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , to use . select text instead as follows : execute the mouse button pressed while you move the mouse over the other end of the text and again reset the mouse button .
in this way , use the audi@@ ble mouse button . this will always be played when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . so you know exactly when when smart moving the shift period begins . later , you can use the smart move also without the audi@@ ble mouse click here . however , it needs some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case in most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and set them correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome and the st@@ aff@@ ection of the mouth past@@ es p@@ ains .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . also , it can also be configured to set a certain time that a pulling @-@ process begins before the mouse button is left . in this way , the pulling and dis@@ lay can be carried out using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows users to talk to their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; the user can choose the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talks , which should be addressed again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) you specify the command , which is later used for the language issue of text . further details will be found in the description of the catalogue .
on the second page , select the Standard @-@ Text textbook . you can often choose the appropriate passages from the text@@ books without requiring in@@ tap . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photograph ) you determine the dictionary for the worst . &amp; k@@ mouth . read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can select the voc@@ abul@@ ary with a Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary making only correctly printed words into the password .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly structured and contains basically an input field for the key@@ note of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and an exp@@ iry of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field at screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can choose from that propositions which should be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth . open ... open the setting dialog for &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog box contains two cards of cards , language output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ most and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of box @-@ language issue you specify the command to call the language of the language . in the selection box below the input field , you specify the character encoding with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is displayed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , it depends on the command version of your voice generator . this command you will find in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of that you will find in App@@ endix .
with as possible language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as a first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . the kt@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standardis@@ ed interface for language output and which is currently useful in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the initial selection field action after selecting a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ note or by selecting a text passage in the menu text @-@ book book or in the l@@ ath for text @-@ lay@@ ered books .
with the selection of so@@ jour@@ ned , the selected text passage will be directly talking and additionally to the exp@@ iry of the input field . the selected text passage will initially be entered only into the input field .
with the second selection field closing of the administration window for Text @-@ textbook , you can define whether the textbook is automatically saved when closing the administration window .
with the selection of text matching book , the book is stored . if you select any changes , the textbook register is not saved . select before saving , it will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the textbook is to be stored .
the page of Wor@@ ter@@ nal contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word . in the main window shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , when this list includes more than a dictionary . using this select field you can choose the currently used dictionary .
with buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries or expor@@ ting them to a file . below the list you can set the language and select the language for the dictionary .
select this source you want to select the language ; &amp; k@@ mouth . read the number of the individual words simply determined by counting the step . in addition , you can compare the voc@@ abul@@ ary with Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org , to include only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can assemble the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask , what are dic@@ tion@@ aries together , and how these weights are to be set .
with this option , you will create a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ entered into the dictionary , in the course of time , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary .
the main panel of the window to the processing of text pass@@ ag@@ onal boards is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text boxes are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding scanning book . if you have selected a textbook book , you can change just whose name .
actions like new text passages or books add or selected text pass@@ words and books can either be written via the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a hing@@ ed menu .
the sequence of passages and passages can be changed through drawing with the mouse to the new place or the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , the text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the run storage is selected .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , the text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the run storage is selected .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sets of the run storage is used .
this menu entry is crossed , there is a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is located by default directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the shaded left side and pulling the tool bar to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow vest in the lower part of the main window is displayed on the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
this menu entry is crossed , there is a sli@@ dable strip for text pass@@ age@@ able books with entries . the l@@ ste can be ordered by default directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the shaded left side and pulling the tool bar to another place .
probably , you have the command for speech output not correct or not fully entered . open Settings ... , open the page General Settings and give the command for language issue on the card interface language issue . ( see setting dialog for Language syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a speech output system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ man are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the speech output , it is believed that festival / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the language issue is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language issue , we assume that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fil@@ esystem . the language output is then possible with one of the three following command samples :
for the third example the option has to be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS ) .
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ eme to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free to non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , using the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / K@@ usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to be swal@@ lowed with the last character of the text so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ is@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . option data must be switched on .
the speech output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is currently being developed by SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the setup of the speech can only be set in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you will need to use as low as possible language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
for setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which is displayed in the dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . there is a list already saved by the calcul@@ ator that users can still re@@ build again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; do not include a language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

before you can setup &amp; kt@@ ts , you must install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
when the first start@@ up of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speaker is furnished , the cart@@ ei@@ card speaker is displayed . see also if you have set at least one speaker , the card chart will appear . see .
most of the T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as various males or female , or such that are in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker when you use &amp; cle@@ us ; use the program speed disper@@ sion otherwise the standard equipment .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several pressure expectations for the same printer .
when you click on the box card speakers in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the box card speaker is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start the ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is furnished .
all the furnished speakers will appear in this list . the preferred nar@@ rator appear in the list . the top speaker is used for language output when an application is given no speaker .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a single click with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a single click with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to slide the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list is also its priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
choose a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and gir@@ th vote for selection .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the Card speaker , click here . to change the settings of this spokes@@ man , click on Edit .
now you can see &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the map file and check if language output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can read &amp; kt@@ ops ; see . now , you can read and manage text . click on the map file orders to create and manage text applications . see .
if you have set at least one speaker , you can open the language running system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the cart@@ oning card in General to open the card card . here you can set up some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; ct@@ ance ; this start is successful , the box card orders are displayed and you can create text orders and preview . see . remove the mark , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and de@@ activated the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when the kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it goes &amp; ct@@ ed@@ ; further , if the field language output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appear automatically within the system range of the control bar , it dis@@ appears as soon as the presentation is completed .
with the buttons in this row you can start text mot@@ ions , stop , stop and return .
with the buttons in this series you can preview the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board can be read or read a text file to preview . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on users or OK , then all changed settings on all sides .
the card card orders are only indicated when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ oning card in General and enable the box to activate language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you may read the text of the displayed website . check first if you want to read , and choose the text menu text . after a short time , speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to select the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step even though , but then many &amp; HTML ; exciting and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read text in text . check first if &amp; kt@@ oria . check out the text that is to be read , and choose the main menu Tools text . then , speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which you can be notified of you by specified events . you can also read the text of this news also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can address different kinds of messages ; for example , if you may be notified if in an I@@ RC channel a message appears where your nick@@ name is coming . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC news news .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy are subject to application depending on application .
filter for the animation of the string offer a good opportunity to correct or correctly . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it remov@@ es the tags b@@ r and b from the news that can be assumed , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases than assum@@ ing . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not necessary .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed before it is sent to the program of the program . they are useful for the improvement of the language to substitute wrong words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , select a matching speech or nar@@ rator or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthesis and their votes .
in order to understand the working methods of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; HR disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; is working with a text and distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars have the highest priority . it will be prec@@ eded by all other applications and will keep these orders . if the issue of Screen reader is read , the rest@@ rained orders will continue resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; Processor is getting hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message supp@@ ress normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are easy text assign@@ able . each order you are used by boxes boards . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text applications . lyrics are intended for the issue of longer texts that have no particular gl@@ ing@@ ness .
all four orders are processed in maintenance , with the exception of the issue of Screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a prec@@ urs@@ or , this issue will be stopped and terminated .
first of all , you need to know that filter is never applied to the output of Screen re@@ ars . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter make the text and keep it next to the next filter . at present there are three types of fil@@ tering .
filter are designed as modules . in the future it can still be types of filters .
replace parts of a text by text and replace parts of a text by other text . it can be taken either as words or as a regular expres@@ sions , which has the replacement of chat @-@ emotions as : - ) by text or for the transformation of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; included in a format in another format . included are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can order orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice on the box card , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ s. read about it .
each of these different filters has set the rules on which it is applied for a language issue . if the filter make sure its rules is not correct , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fication of &amp; ct@@ al ; sent by all activated filters , which have been set on the page below . machining through the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the set @-@ up filters . if a filter does not inter@@ sec@@ ts , it is not enabled , and will not be used . filter will be re@@ produced from the series down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filters , and it will be shown below the following set dialog boxes .
to set a list of words or regular expres@@ sions , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . if the text is replaced by the associated replacement text . large and small statement will not be considered as comparison .
enter a name for your filter . you can select one name in this name , it must only be distinguished by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column . the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download or delete a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to store the current list or delete . download a list of file stored on the existing list .
here is a language written here , the filter is only used if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages when pressing the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is written here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comp@@ ut@@ a . example : counter @-@ mail , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers have to wake you up . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 has to be displayed , you can only enter your head .
the animation filter is then applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the boxes sealing filter apply if apply . all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
the words used in the form \ \ s Word \ \ see in comparison of words used in the form \ \ &apos;s Word \ \ . the words must therefore be restricted by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instruction to write regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Additional &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ ph .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . however , it can only be installed on your system . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c need to be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the spokes@@ person option you can send texts to a particular spokes@@ person who is on the box card speaker , or at a speaker with certain properties . you can define that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before moving to the filter there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is directed by the spokes@@ man for the text , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , and the characteristics of the speaker can be selected . with the spokes@@ person option , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
here &apos;s a value entered , the filter is applied if the text is applied to the entered regular expression . if the text is applied to the entered regular expression . if the text is installed , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the features of your desired microphone . if the text meets the top of the filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog .
use this button to store or delete all settings or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ person option is then applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ es filter apply if necessary . you need to enter at least one condition .
the language output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; to give the programmer their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD are added , such that syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / / bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start immediately in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; XML ; air filter filters , but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that if you don &apos;t have this voice to read on web pages . make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and you can find over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain character or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs seem to cause mist@@ akes to syn@@ thesizer , so that all propositions are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ or@@ ossi@@ p , what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure that the option is set to the appropriate value for the respective language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string substitute filter . see .

the list of the above languages can be un@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check out on the website , according to information that are not yet contained in this manual .
the program &quot; HR disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers . if you want to expand &amp; purchase ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ izers , put yourself with the development team in conjunction with the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ach@@ ment ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the bund@@ le of the program and the development files for the program &quot; Live disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts by &amp; ct@@ ts ; from the source archives for k@@ de@@ ways , or have downloaded Tar@@ ball for each night you have downloaded and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; ct@@ al ; check first if the case @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . for this , you can use the tran@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program of the program of the program of the program is designed to be further developed , that the setup of single @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is dis@@ assembled in individual sets . the user can return , or leave the user to rest or cancel the output .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts , specify the characteristics of the preferred speaking speaker for the issue . if you can choose a female speaker , the language used English and its sex is used , otherwise it will be automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker has chosen you can see in .
when you click on the box card subject to add , and therefore click on the list box or click on editing , the boxes of the cartridge will be displayed . as an example , please find the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . details about the modules are available .
specify the path to the extensive festival program . if the path leads to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival .
select the character code for text that will be handed over to the festival . for Vo@@ ices , the &amp; ct@@ ance ; this setting is automatically made . in general , the Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 is used to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these nozzles we provide volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a controller , and displayed this gray , the voice will not be displayed by you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices will already be loaded faster at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set of memory is faster than the first set of memory .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet installed any speaker ( or forgot to click on users ) . see .
this check box is marked with the launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window appears . otherwise , after starting only the symbol kt@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the system section to display the program window .
if the check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . this allows you to stop or control it otherwise .
here are all orders listed in the waiting area , along with the application that has adjusted the order , the number of sets and the just processed set . the speaker ID is equivalent to the column ID on the speaker board speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can choose a full ise in the order that is selected in the list below , or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &apos;s sound system ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the cart@@ ei@@ card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen re@@ covers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select here the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , it was compiled ; either without support for the respective audio module , it can &apos;t download the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used here , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module , select the PCM device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on application to accept the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this map map , you can use special actions which are always carried out if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars have the highest priority . it will be prec@@ eded by all other orders . after the issue of Screen @-@ reader it has been read , the rest@@ rained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warning will have the next priority here . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; Processor is going to be hot . a warning will retain the output from messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message supp@@ ress normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can interpre@@ t messages . if you can read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone welcome to enter the room .
if a text is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output into the waiting long .
this audio file will always be played when a standard text is interrupted . if both the introductory sound is active as well as executive news , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory feedback .
the settings on this cardboard card are only valid for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and issues of Screen re@@ covers , there are no special actions when these are interrupted by a high priority .
to preview with &amp; ct@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages preview , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card al@@ erts will appear .
select this check box to switch the preview of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications , this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts .
when this setting is marked , al@@ erts can be played when a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or from it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; shipped if anyone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events that cannot be noted in the list , will be igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection field to set what &amp; ct@@ ance ; to do if an event happens . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the features of the desired microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list box spokes@@ person as upper entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events which is specified for a particular event of a specific application , this promotion will perform . otherwise , the action for all other events of certain application is executed . as the last option , the action comes to carrying out the default ( all other events ) .
the event all noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the al@@ ert noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button to save the settings for the al@@ erts . use the button to load stored settings from a file . the invited events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark the control of voices , speaking speed , the volume , the sex , and pitch . furthermore , a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently , &amp; ct@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard agree to use the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch dialog can not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mama Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear lying in my bed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ sel@@ bound@@ ary filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this may not start with the preview , because only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not all the text order . thus , you can also jump or stop or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up as a set of pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . you can add the settings or add a further pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter , but it is recommended .
on the sim@@ pl@@ est way you will learn the device selection from and give text to reading . turn the microphone selection again , change some features and check out how the choice of the microphone has changed . to this , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is inv@@ alid .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then how fast with the preview can start , because only the first proposition should be processed and not all the text block , which can last a long time ,
you can then stop or cancel word assign@@ ments on the map of map or cancel this function , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement of the movement is automatically set up when you start the ts@@ m@@ gr . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you do .
the pro@@ positi@@ onal Identi@@ fication filter compare text with an regular expression for pro@@ ofs and add a tab@@ ul@@ atory number ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limit ( Tab@@ ul@@ atory ) are automatically removed from the text . note that the default of the default of the set filters are the default .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ icking ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of Screen re@@ ars .
if you have removed from the normal pressure limit filter , you can add these again by load the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the box office microphone selection you can over@@ write the microphone settings for application . the card chart will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the speaker board speaker ) . with other words : there are no microphone properties specified .
use of the most suitable microphone holder , which has all the characteristics of a set @-@ up microphone . if you do not select or edit , choose &amp; dict@@ ts ; this speaker comes from . otherwise select &amp; cle@@ ver ; the speaker comes from the most originally set properties .
select the method to entering the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the features of the desired microphone . if this feature does not play any role , don &apos;t give anything .
select this check box when the attri@@ bute may have priority before other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , these always will always be treated as prime feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you may know that a certain application was sent in another language than that entered into the working environment .
in order to use all the properties in the field of speakers , which is on the nearest to the following , click on the list box standard and then use the speaker , which is on the most below .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the waiting area . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is needed ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; fix@@ tures . probably , you have to record G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it is possibly a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can upgrade G@@ streaming to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work when I play simultaneously with another application music . when I get a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; a message appears : that is to open PCM .
on your system , the problem exists that conflict in AL@@ SA may occur that the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . references to possible solutions will be found on the website of AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use them in festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / Tit@@ ic@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the box card audio , there is a setting speed . that this works , the program SO@@ X installed and can be found through the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ ized modul@@ us like festival Interactive are offering a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are igno@@ red if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read it . ( this is what the speed is controlled in SS@@ ML ) . de@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are completely bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ yz file of the filter , and set the microphone speed up .
I think it is not that websites can be read from a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . that festival doesn &apos;t produce any errors , the X@@ SL file th@@ rows the converting of SS@@ ML to S@@ but the gender tags . same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a pair of animation and now I can go to &amp; ct@@ ts ; do not go any longer a pair or go back . on the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter order is indicated , the order consist of one proposition . what am I doing wrong ?
inter@@ actions ( point , fragments , clamation mark , Com@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) you may not cover any filters . instead , use a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal detection .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is based on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected )
track record in version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer is recorded by clicking the G@@ ST register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts during audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t start playing music and then start a text if you start a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de is still no real breaks . if you keep a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current proposition is still read .
the SO@@ X audio program is used for the general setting of the microphone speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a Tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar wrapped archive ) , sign up as normal user and un@@ pack the Tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change in this folder and give the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &apos;s &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least on request will be created .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers are created by default . some of them have a runtime of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Direc@@ tives of Deb@@ ian Distribution ) . configure the running parameters to configure the configure parameter settings .
the default will be displayed as default ; in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you have to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option .
on Deb@@ ian systems is / usr / local the right folders for programs that are translated from sources .
CD @-@ de@@ able echo c@@ c@@ vs &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f macro fil@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd @-@ ts@@ p make su make install
before you can use &amp; ct@@ al ; check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the vote is generally good and there are multiple voices and languages . with many voices , you can adjust noise , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are shipped with the festival . if you want to read websites you need to install ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you will need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of Festival . the german voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice requires the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to set the k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions and are therefore first looking for the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 bit c@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the mb@@ rol@@ a ; Syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ y analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; a complete speech output system is created . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival created this by &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; required di@@ phon@@ o t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be used from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; controllers ; , which enables the management of network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; control@@ center incorpor@@ ation ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; controller center can be accessed by selecting from K menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; control@@ center ; create a simple surface for the users :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; control@@ center ; displayed . network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by a selection of control@@ l@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; amp ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not need to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be operational and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device can display at all and enables setting of the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnished . network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version .
the module network settings will be loaded when selecting network settings in &amp; control@@ center ; -@@ Index is chosen . when starting the module network settings , this is automatically recognized by the platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the box selection will be offered . it &apos;s the platform from the list , setting the distribution and release of the best . due to check @-@ in setting , the definition can be permanently taken permanently . when the next start of the network settings will then be set up automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system administ@@ er mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed . in the system administ@@ er mode , you are able to display in system management mode at the right end of module . it is necessary for setting the password mode .
in system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the Reiter network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from riders network interfaces can be executed by the following tasks :
the settings of the required network interfaces can be setup with selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to setup ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the button extended settings displays the dialog with further finishing possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the list box can either be selected with DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the option manual , no DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be set to the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address you need to specify the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is to set up the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not required , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog can be displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . if the already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can find whether the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network is being asked to be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switched on a switched network device is made by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled depending on your needs . dis@@ able a activated network device via selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
the IP address of the host is fixed in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ nets .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the respective IP address . that &apos;s necessary because computers could only understand IP addresses . if the computer does ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS server will dis@@ solves this name into a IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for a name @-@ resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , or changed to .@@ DNS entries can be stored by selecting a paper and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons or down in the priority .
Adding the button to add ... from the group of calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog of New Nam@@ es@@ erv@@ er .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will edit the dialog .
the list of nam@@ efully use computers for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks can replace the DNS server .
normally , the list includes differently calcul@@ ators , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . these are still in the present version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click on Add .... The New dialog dialog box will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add . if the well @-@ known computers has several alias name , add the button Adding several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit computers will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK , the list of static host@@ esses will be updated .
the settings fixed in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the command must be removed in one &amp; console ; the following command will be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ ? sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . simply download the rpm package and to install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical user can be used like a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks will be published , in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; file configuration files will be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more information on IP networks . only basic information on the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated in a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 5 is never found wide spread . it is expected that it focuses on the future . this description focuses on widespread use of IPv4 .
one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of an interface interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administ@@ rators to be configured or if available , the IP address cannot be chosen as desired .
when applying your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially chosen area to avoid IP address data using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines via setting up a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks to up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask was set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are subscri@@ bed to the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is needed for the IP connection .
the ad@@ ress 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files are described by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically modified in DSL connections , so it was not surprising , if in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as specified there .
for &amp; SuSE Linux , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a sick@@ ness program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it provides the ability to create several archives on a band . the first goal was to create a question for the fast , selective award . the second goal was the answer to a question that caused my wife : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; mo@@ il the band back and read the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the leader in the band cannot be asked if the band is being format@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ ouse , it sear@@ ches after the matching index on your disk . can this not be found , you will be asked if the tape index will be created .
everything goes smooth , changing the symbol for the tape drive to display that the band has been bound . in the Status Bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through the fold of the single entry for the band .
before leaving the belt , first payment has to be solved , there are three methods to do this .
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen through a modification of the symbol for the band that the binding for the band has been resolved and shows an appropriate message in the Status Bar . the band can now be rejected without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ; format@@ ted .
a tape types must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not require the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drives must be format@@ ted , it must be done before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; usually , the tape drives are usually format@@ ted as a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape drives , D@@ AT drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band called and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . that can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only supporting this file or folder .
select a profile profile in the tree . only those specified in the profile are secured .
select files in local file tree with one her@@ k@@ ets . only those marked files and / or sub @-@ folders are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the F@@ ech@@ oes menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog for backup . in this dialog you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialogue appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the directory entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the files in one of the files for the band with one her@@ k@@ ets . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in any of the archive and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was launched , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection once and change the folders for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears dialog . this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can slide the restore , the files you need to be restored , can be marked with two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives created for entry for the tape drive . it &apos;s only produced the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archive with a bun@@ ches . only those selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archive and select menu restore ....
once the un@@ lock procedure was started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog , you can check your selection once and change the folders for recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ able file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing inde@@ x@@ ing files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is a back@@ ing profile with the straight selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current work folder where the backup is to be made . the list of the secured files will be updated automatically according to the relevant work folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that are placed on other file systems , can be used separately on backup files . each entry will be viewed by t@@ ar regardless of the other file system .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file will have been backed up since then .
the name of the file , which is used for determination of changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of kno@@ bs files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ YO@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be set :
the complete path for the belt drive for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the belt device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band bound the command to the drive . when some drives is necessary , this is necessary before reading or writing operations .
the option is switched on , tries and dat ; the start of a tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , if the binding is switched off &amp; c@@ dat ; automatically the band is dis@@ car@@ ded . use this option not to floppy disk drives .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ level block size for the tape drive . no all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you have to use &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size is required for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat is format@@ ted , a band format@@ ted , writing a file to the start of the tape . this file should only consist of a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format ID . the format of this character string is the name : seconds , being the name of the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives that can be administ@@ rated directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not around incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active if a band is bound .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; check boxes log ; experienced users using quick access to information on problems which appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system decides on the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; check system log ; experienced users using the quick access to information on problems which appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; therefore , some extended functions can be filtered and analysed with the help of the Protocol files of certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 possesses &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and will be explained in other chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen photo , it displays &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; features available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file are easily fil@@ tering and sort ; the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and fil@@ tering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries to open the system log , the first major message file of the system - the system log has started . it is probably not displayed with system administrator right . the protocol files can be found under Linux normally in the / var / log file , for the normal user does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to fil@@ tering the filter bar . in the default setting , select the list box next to the filter . in the default setting , select a protocol line only displayed , if in one of the columns select the strings of the filter search term .
you can also select an other entry at this spot . the strings of the filter search term is then simply select the column process , and then carry out the filter bar into the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; all Protocol lines , which were sent from this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines . record lines of level error are displayed with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color than Protocol lines of level note . the colored display of Protocol lines can be switched to .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the protocol , or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can choose the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command as for example to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines within the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; allows the ad to open multiple protocol files into separate under@@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a window window , select menu of the Display menu .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; has a dedicated website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ ellers log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further current information about the use of &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; .

the In@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to do a machine at System V In@@ it , without a new installation and new format . that is why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc are directly in / etc . this folder name r@@ c.@@ .@@ D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you wish to start the system or upgrade to another round level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once launched . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if it is not much use for this . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something , what to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for various places after the in@@ it program and starts the first he finds .
the default level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default factory level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair anything , then you can repair anything , then re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you ls -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , every record here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d list .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts are written that there will be an argument like start and stop . you can start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will stop with the argument , when it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could only run ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore I could have a user level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; . it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is easy to say to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry in the field of availability services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts themselves between runners or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere . thus , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or his position ) . this happens only if they extract an entry from the availability process services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed when you move them into a new area . to choose them , select Copy from the menu pane or choose from the context menu and enter into the target range -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sor@@ ting box of a single entry cannot be calculated additionally . in such a case you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try to include the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful not .
you can use the tab key to activate the various work ranges ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc . ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of top or below the previous .
to move a entry into another round level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; x ) and add it into the desired level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ting box or name of a single entry , press the input button to open the tab dialog . use the dialog button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to refuse the changes .
because of the risk of data loss all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . default is the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise it will be available . otherwise , changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard @-@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts continuously . what can I do ?
specify at the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have set some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details on the manual of the distribution .
the way , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , it simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propri@@ etary structures of this distribution , but unfortunately does not require a standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; plan an extension to the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please verify whether all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) is easy without message if your configuration files are not available or unt@@ rue .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send information about the run@@ level to make this manual added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you &apos;ll need to save it . either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry store in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards of cards , user and user group . for editing , select the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialogue user and group characteristics .
some card cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended limits ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a box card will be produced , if shadow pass@@ words , or example / etc / master .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix .
the map file password will appear if shadow pass@@ words , or example / etc / master .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this box card is only activated , if for at least one embedded file system is activated and initi@@ alized ( visible at the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can be changed for each user parameters , the limited liability limitation in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for any file system . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field file system .
cart@@ ei@@ map groups informs about the group of selected types of the selected user . the standard group where the user belongs , you will find in the prim@@ itive group . furthermore , the user can select in other groups by select this in the large field .
the dialog box features a list of all users . to add a group to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , add adding from the menu users or group or click the appropriate tool button to select the tool bar . the edit or del@@ etion of the selected users or the selected group is analog@@ ous .
with this module you can add the L@@ ILO Con@@ boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , change , and more .
