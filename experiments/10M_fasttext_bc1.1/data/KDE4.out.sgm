<seg id="18">A rectangle may be labeled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature you can specify if enough space is displayed, or if the area of subordinate right angle should be displayed, then you can define the relative position of the inscription on the rectangle below.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the algorithms for treads, the area should be kept proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this goal is not always observed, and this frame is not always available anymore. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a distribution of a single entry for the assigned entries, the implementation remains. here, it is possible for the label and avoidance of space due to space whenever possible, the right are as possible. the best methods are related to lines, columns or rectional evaluation.</seg>

<seg id="75">& digios; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, reable software collection for digital cameras, which has been developed a constantly common protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to host and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are slowly connected to the serial port, this connection is now fold. & digiplug; supports this cameras and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>

<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly beyond your disk. if you have enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. you will then use a folder for images that can be printed or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% working files will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier. split new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend metadata option to use the metadata of the metadata in & digious. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can also select the metadata of the database by clicking the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what would like to change? it will be introducing a metadata editor for a number of selected Attribucks. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now begin the real work, as you can now select every photo words, lettering and an evaluation. you can start all the images that the same attribute require and then put the value. this makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you do with other programs often, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you importing catalogised images from another source with built-in sampling, then the images will be applied to the correct spot. the subsorting of Hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving images from & digious; updated while under the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata suede. this is a very rough representation, because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the stitching - the next section relates to record or comments using your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most often don't want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from afar off is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may have even changed the perception of this panoramic view completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other those of your photos look, the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to viewer, to help Him about the motive that moves you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is okay if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength just with a label for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digials; you can also save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8). if you can export your images in Web-galleries, these fters will be exported to your wishes into the label and / or title of the web-gallery system. you need to tell us about the story this second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? good, because with pictures the train departs the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalise are already innumerable and will be even deeper into the future. I am sure to open your travel virtually through pictures with geographical data. you can also download the photos at the recording location. you can also export the pictures at the recording location. you can also export images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. with Google Maps Maps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocabulary with Copyright and signify the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also applied in all versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is explained in the information page of & digious; when information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and author): this field should be your name, or name of the person who created the photo. if it is not wished, the name of the photographer can be used, then the name of a company or organization is used. after that this value, it should not be changed anymore. this field does not support cmas nor semi-commercially as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Car rental (synonym for the author): associating with the author. examples of this field contains the work designation of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: employee photographer, free photographer or independent photographer. since this is a merk to the authority field, this must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for providers): use the Anbieterfeld, to identify the photo. this must not be the author. if the photographer has to be listed here. if the image is shown here. if the image is a storage photo, then the group / Agency will be displayed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright issues, though this is no protection against misuse. each of which is a little more than basic metadata, can erase or change this problem. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. digial & digios was delivered; there will be a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, record failures, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desiring, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we can't tell about CDs that went on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. this section is concerned about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery in the world, has several interesting statistics that causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem of CDs / DVDs, you must not have more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe this is in your measurable game.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you are using good disks and good capture devices and are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it turns the right to select.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very eventful for error, even if you just have written down. therefore, use a control program to protect themselves. 75% of data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection he needed them through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called Iso Buster's apparent miracle of CDs and DVDs. it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that can also read damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to be able to win the HD DVD's format. a dual player Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a Dual-player DVD with 8.5 GB. of course everything about CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn the media with a good start to qualitatively high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. read the media with a description, date & author keywords and then to a clean, dark dry and in-proof place. do not forget to read the data on the next generation of media before you can read this media or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discourse manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: dissemination</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: discs are the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. For lower temperature conditions, the most common error cause, SMART can not notice these errors. some of SMART can terminate the impending diarrhea. this is especially readers and publisher. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have the loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses could be reproduced without much problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not a lot of power, these devices can take heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these devices can cause severe damage, complete data loss, hardwarage, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a portion of the energy heat absorbs and the rest. it is usually contained in the form of a plug-strip. remember that it does not contain any overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a particular minimum of protection. you should also consider that it protects against lightening strikes and protects the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripheral devices can be connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these tools are developed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, they are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While protecting your system protects your system from smaller variations in the electricity lines it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be meaningfully into a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically save battery energy and the system automatically runs until the current run. if you get a UPS, you should make sure that they get the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and contrast with the costs to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider as good your computer is used. at the end you should think all the cable before you enter into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service provides S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can save for any quantities of your data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a poor solution but it is no general safety solution. however, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will get more available to you, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will get unlimited memory what should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup are the web solutions very safe. transmission errors will automatically be automatically adjusted according to the TCP protocol and with the major firms, such a backup and a partial memory are available.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmission ratios are due for transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs are at least ensure the integrity of the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. nobody seems to have thought to have it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data away as the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you're not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle on low level and can be scaled. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btr. file system. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protective mechanism used for & Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data losses related to notebook and 46% at work systems. in case of notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of viruses. it causes a minor damage, such as Theft or Neuinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know quite a few viruses and under & Linux; however, no one has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English items can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and a definable status is avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human bugs are the main causes for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 apertures from fundamentally physical limits. is that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Current cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixels Sensors. even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk is available today for 100 & euro; so you do not get any other for data loss. thus, secure your data frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something dangerous like the new installation of your operating system, replacing boards or size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then a day, a flash beats you luck if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster beats locally too and destroyed a lot. forget plane incriminals: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, Despering is still a no local store. bring your stairs up to the neighbour, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete fuse: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without histories and provides a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generate a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete securing point and the last differential securing.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status to any time restore. this backup comes to a versioning system in the next with the exception that it is just retrieved and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily create on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens if you want to raise safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important pictures after you are saved on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you have enough time to get losses and restore again. at the same time, you get a complete final version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly Momentail for at least one month and a Momentail for every month. each further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the picture file stored IPTC information, affiliated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, vision equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With this valuable pictures that can survive the next 40 years, there is about the time span in which you really interested in you because they are reminded of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies That should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, everything is said to be careful with caution and restoring the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask how the current system is backwards compatible. if less variations you have used in the past, it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is presently available for everyone. so, if you have an old system, so you can read and install it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you can change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay at Open Standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist pressure to change a system in its size. actually, it is always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have the scalability with the scalability and the area where you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. on * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and leave it on a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg, if your new record was recognized by the system, but do not hang it on.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & LT; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & LT; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no longer software that can be read, then you can create them. this task is made easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. they should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can be much more. it is less loss, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administration information, but not as many as TIFF and requires a slow compression. this format is recommended to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is however, that this format has been adapted to many people. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the hardware / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon even sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to include the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a blend of XML and RDF. the file information will be allowed to create their data in a file itself. the file information will be stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archived in the raw format, mostly in the raw format. XMP adapts to the metadata separately from the metadatendatei and the image file and how above you can imagine the raw format. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that support for completely compatible Online metadata standards, which includes a large range of applications and business models. on the activities of DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explaining efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures of the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and store them in your raw view. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer machining, you can use external programs. if you return the images again with & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it then in Webgaleries, add in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; in section adding 1 photos to an album, you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing pictures to your album charts.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the computer switches on the display mode and switch it. a further description can be found on the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, this one tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a distance indicator of all photos on the camera is displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about any entry. using the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a single entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file features and the photo information that are internally stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that for some digital cameras not all information are available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata as EXIF, manufacturer remarks, GPS and the image. these information are the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digios; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is downloading and then downloading all photos. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digios;. when downloading, photos are not deleted in an album before you want to delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option options from & kde; select the photos selected, use the button to download and then selected selected. the button selection is downloadable until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, is an option New download. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digios; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons all over or selected from selected, a dialog appears where you can select the target album where photos are sorted. details on the folder you can read in section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you selected the target album, press OK, and & accessed. loads photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the photos downloaded, you can erase them from the camera, by removing the button Delete. if you want to delete just a few, you need to select this first and delete it reset.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should be carefully checked in the trashtray; if you have been downloaded from the camera. if you want to erase the camera, you should make it more quickly over the camera, since it is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially meaningful names. if the photos are deleted from the camera, this may be meaningful if you have photos of different recording series into the same album. therefore, it can be meaningful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for dates. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate. the first two concern the data about the author in Section standard Autoridentity. if you choose this, the corresponding entries will be copied to the EXIF data. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded photos.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to wish to use another date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% -% H:% M:% S. turn the option dates and time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strentime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the possibility to change the file names in lowercase or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digios; for a photo is used, is below the name displayed in the preview of the camera. their settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious, can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the timing. not all cameras can use this information. in the section sidebar Metadata you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is switched on, and if your camera does not supplies this information, & digious is the photo in the original orientation. if you off the automatic turning off, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date of what the photo was made, it can be taken & digious. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same album. not all cameras can be loaded into the same album. in the section sidebar Meta Data, you can read which information might be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case stores & digious records. if you want to change this option, you will need to switch off this option. use the directory based sub-based floors at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computer is the button to download. then select upload files. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file containing the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & fixtures, you'd say where the images should be loaded up. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means that the data can be displayed in longitude and latitude and the data can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be executed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to connect a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses an aircraft to attach an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural office and estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can open the area with one click. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious, users want to localize the place of the photos therefore, it is good to specify the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the image? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for manual allocation (manual) and lastly on manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has an GPS unit. but there is a few which work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSRicoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>

<seg id="296">With Chroma sub-sampling, the images should be encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not need the image quality as PNG need a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can decompression the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the Deflate algorithm is less free.</seg>

<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digial, the image processing was only one picture viewer for photos. currently it develops rapidly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the photo processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light than the pixels at odd. if you use this option, this is a bit soft, eliminates the image with a minimum of soft, eliminating the 2x2 Gitterpattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic paint balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white abbalance is not set. default it is a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the effect of the second sensors has more details in the sideways. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the peak, so the parts of your images are introduced to view the edge of your camera as passing away. use some unusual results because they are displayed in various roses. most recently, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the edge.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixel are not as quick filling as green and red. & dcw are trying to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not less blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you rebuild the option, you get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for every picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the Standard 1. however, this may also be done later in the images of the & digial. this can also be done later in order to keep time for demosaing.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosatone algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete picture from the particle data that provides many cameras and that a matrix-colour pixel is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>

<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof-Profile, which allows you to emulate how your printer can print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be satisfied. this could adjust manually, rather than to leave your printer on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for them for what is intended. unfortunately, this is not suitable for the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>

<seg id="337">& digios; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improvement. the image processing can be launched by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the entry menu of the entry menu entry / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The photo processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & digios; so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules are available in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most common features.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the photo processing change your photos. however, no the functions will change the original photo, before you save the Save or the button saving from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo, once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should open a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproduce or push button the button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have been carried out in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any promotion of the image processing can be reproduced or restored, and the last action can reboot automatically by select editing, edit or reproduced from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are using this, you should select the shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reproduce and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; you can choose a minute or restore button in the toolbar a moment you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are also reproduced or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the photo processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation use in the toolbar, image high, picture, or the entries in the menu file. if you want changes to the current photo, you will ask if you want to save these.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can use the photo in and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the safepid menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a picture to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the Esc button. normally, you can change the toolbar. if you don't want to change it from the & digiplug; check out the panel dialog. check the section for setting up the photo processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select in the menu file image and receive the standard & kde; compression dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can select individual pictures or complete sets. all image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you have to select only the pictures with the standard methods. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug came; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, the important information and actions for the selected images are available, without the navigation use, also available in the photo processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider leaves the sidebar or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view you can enter or insert the inscription below. this text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- Fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data will only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and if you want to use special characters. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you've commented it, you will either use the button to use or change to the next image, the label are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can always read the metadata in the files. this is always done if you have a metadata setting which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section Review shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars at the sidebar. to rate several pictures at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC site. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to the filtering of the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously shown in this & digial; meeting applied.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search phrase. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is an additional relief for the input of keywords in a picture-series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar with their album, - date, keyword and search results are used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the cutting quantity of these two passwords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and cut off. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply go out from the right side bar and put on the selection. then a dialog appears that you're asking if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on one keywords, indicating the quantity to three images. they were drawn up with Ctrl + a and then put a keyword from the right keyword to the selection and put it down there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be disabled on different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry where in the database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search via all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you will need to use only the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options below are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you set a color-off workflow is that the colours indicated by your camera or scanners are a predictable deviation from the fact that your color on your monitor or scanners are the same and the colors that you can print or publish in the web out of your digital darkrooms.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is on color management, everyone wants to know what buttons has to express for the results that would like. unfortunately this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should make sure your own informal decisions to make your own informative decisions to make you the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows all six below the criteria must be performed, then you don't need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are calibrated on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB-color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image are by e-mail or web, where it is the RGB of de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if it works so well and makes life for all so easy, why should one use another color space so you should make thought about color damage ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of RGB in comparison to the colours which we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors which we can see, the huspring-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, check out Bruce Lindblooms side and click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to allocate my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB space space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB-color space or not you have to connect your monitor in the RGB space. if you are in the color space of sRGB, you need either use your monitor to the sRGB-standard kalligum, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it therefore before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abt, automatic and contrast, expand from the menu correct Automatic correction to automatically make your colours the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects, to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scaled by the whole picture, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its shades. this function is often a magical correction for images that be dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method is adjusted the luminosity of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram's range is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in the improvement of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation which causes either marvel at a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">The same method maximizes the color range in red, green and blue-channel. it determines the dark and bright boundaries and adjusts the red, green and blue-ducts for the complete histories.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by changing the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new jiregeneration of all values between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiplug was taken; is a semi automated tool to perform the white abt of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white abell correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can see how far from the original picture you can perform areas with overexposure time. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, your possibilities for correction shall fail better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white waste algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochastic. they start the text entry colors white abusing the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adapted to the size. on the left side are adapted to both the original picture as well as the preview of the target images. the preview is dynamically correct the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, it is enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target pictures has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram is displayed, once you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very beneficial when most pixel is very small Luminance values. with a button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your earnings depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows are adjustable, you can improve the shadow details of your photos or even dimms down.</seg>
<seg id="401">By clicking on the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then use somewhere in the image preview for calculating the colour temperature of white image. on this type, the temperature and green values will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposed aggregate indicators will increase the colors if more than a colour version of the Pixels is overexposed. this is shown in the preview of a pure indicator and does not have the effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The knobs Save as and loading do exactly this. each setting of white abuses that you have set to save in a text file and later reload.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button default settings will return all filter values to their standard values and the associated neutral white image. note that even neutral settings can be specified as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the codiers per color channel of the engineered picture. 8-bit encoding is the wide spread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding requires even more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue such as the processing of raw images. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used for using color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust and allow you to use multiple color channels at the same time. this is useful if your camera or your scanner can always do the same error and you always need to use the same correction. in the manual for the key correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under the gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects provides you four color effects, a solar radiation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon-effect and a cantile filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar ecisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that was developed by a partly developed printing a short flash, and afterwards the development of the image has been inverted the brighter areas darker and the colors by the second lighting. this tool was a partial negatives of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible is. another increase is finally a negative image that is not able to create on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and the treatment (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation guarantee that it makes a stronger contraction effect, that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it simply, it's embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the name of the brand name for daylight and high contrast liner. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot. this is a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers strongly saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. however, Velvias powerful saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those who are scarcely negotiate, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasting. the level level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders of the neonlight. in large images, the filter can overload the entire CPU for one moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusually that you want to correct the color paste and the luminosity of the photos. once you can look at your check in preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in bad light conditions, you can also get a good choice for brightness / saturation. once in this case, it is a good choice for saturation instead of increasing them. all changes they can perform in preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes to Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukness / contrast / Gamma is the tool range correction to improve the exposure of exposure. even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. concrete the three shifter below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the intensity, an histogram, active canals or the selected area. under the graphics are three shifts to change, the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is the controller to move, and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the picture, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmetic Y axis is commonly used. for pictures of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, this logarithmic release is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark sounds, the average for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium sounds, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three tweezers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shade, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range. there are also two controllers can be used in order to evaluate the output values as well as the input values can be used for example, creating a hatched picture as background, while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set to the intensity of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and charging: with these buttons, the set values in the file system are stored and reloaded later. additionally, Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shade, means and sun touches. activate the color icons to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and Luminant channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposed pixels controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and give you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you'll get the effect only in preview and it is no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue canal of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated on your settings. on the right hand the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this select box allows you to specify the channel specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box, there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmetic view. especially the linear mode is the sensual mode. in this case, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode is further improved.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move a short ventures to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones are corresponded with dark sayings and the associated image pixels darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see. if you want this mark on the area you want to change the original score. create a point on this line and move it down, down to the value to your taste is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve which you can generate and reloaded in the file system and later, the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three dpipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and Sundays. activate the dpette which you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed pixels controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in Luminance. shadow and sun screen was used with the dpette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiplug is a tool to enhance the colour channels, or modify the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly advanced tool to mix the colour shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own horsemen.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the destination has a red marker. when you positioning it in a picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to view the respective colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and build it allow you to keep the general brightness as well as you can also keep the option of Monochrome, because the channel mixer is then designed for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from colouring. colouring doesn't occur at the same place in color channel and whose roughs can improve your Monochrome conversion into which you need to reduce the colouring first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storage as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer attitude allows you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposed pixels controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and give you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you'll get the effect only in preview and it is no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below, you can see a photo in which the blue canal is re-adjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original picture is (1) and the image below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / W photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, because colour pictures can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Mill 5 Plus, Ilford Mill 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with one orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air pictures. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure with a red line filter. this creates dramatic power effects and can simulate moon fruit to day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure with an yellow lens filters. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) white filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones throughout it. this is very similar to the process of a print and re-development in a Sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Apply to the digiplug; use of the texture. apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color image or not, you can look like oil painting on a canvas, the bulch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry. applying the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increase the depth of the depth and the dimensional stability of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect was applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and changed under (2) to see. the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">A decorative frame can be added to the digious frame, add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of an viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task. an opportunity to keep its attention is to put an decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame the module can be started from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: using this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. it is coated with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), it is ideal for a nice three-dimensional frame which adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This can be bigger than the original target picture will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text in an image at any place. this is also possible to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use the text box, orientation, color from the color space and character set with its characteristics as you need. you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you chose for your text can be changed, until you push the button "OK." after the picture was saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">Apply templates with the & digiplug; add a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu template apply template in the photo processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you have to add the PNG file format and want to add a copy of the file size of the stencil, so you simply send an e-mail in English to the & digios; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for first time, you need to put your templates with the button Base folder in the dialog. choose the folder where you will copy the stencil files. these settings will be made for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root file has been set for templates, a function view that reflects the file structure of the template's template. the selection of a folder is updated automatically the preview bar of the template.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the lower picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button shrinks the box below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to add the template onto the whole picture, check the picture corresponding to the left mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Apply OK when you want to apply templates onto your image. the image will then automatically adapt the template size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious was available; three different tools are available for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, grains pics.</seg>
<seg id="481">Impetus mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharpics. indeed, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocused is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised pictures require a correction of sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution to form a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more later than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, JPEG pictures are frequently used with internal sharpening. images in the rough format must always be tightened in the processing process.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpant filter during the reading of the image. if you deactivate this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening work sharpen. you can correct the edge of the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this, because the results do not affect the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise level. generally, you will find further information about the menu entry. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to correct the image is much easier than it. use the tool to correct softly and experimenting with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter imurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help the image. the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate good results and should try out first. an increase in the radius or amount amplify the effect. if you make the impetus mask to strong, spoil the noise and the impression of gras close by sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore show images best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignorant picture added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break out of the maximum RGB values and the difference to difference. it is possible to define a minimum difference in order to be applied to an edge of the filter. this way the areas can be prevented with a soft shift between the tones of sharpen and therefore Beauty error in sails, anchovies and watersurfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsurred filter. the original picture is the (1) and the painted picture (2). not sharp masked with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug was focused on the tool, focused on an image by improvement of the sharpness. it used the copyright protected discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to see a picture of & quot; refokushima quot; in which it uses a technique named FIR Viennese filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Vienness mask. Refocussionist usually gets better results than unsurmasked. it can start from the menu by pressing colors Refocussioning in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular folding is much better than the Gauge of the folding. the Gauß has a very long tail, which leads far from the original quitpixel, which is far influenced from the original quitpixel, which is affected by most cases even very strong from the remote pixels. this caused unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular depth: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameters for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very sharp but then on the sound of the sound.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help save artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase of the robbery can help you to reduce Artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only. if the noise filter is very poor, the image quality is very poor. a high value is 0,03. a high value is still not smearing the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifact. if you have a value equal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. if you choose large values for the circular flow or the Gauss's sharpness. note that the module may be very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity modification on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module, before you change the image. the reason for this is that many surgical changes have not immediately visible, but then left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read and compress pictures, and eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, they produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by a relatively sharp maskan in a major neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to produce unsharp masked always artifact. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the FIR Viennese filters always at least just as good as the spurine mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in machining of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unlocked image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original fsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the Auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpectual structure in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">In order to generate the discourse of the range of the darkening range, in order to generate an even more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inner Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings you can use the tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value causes homogeneous regions smoothing and details. a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no sharpening should be necessary. please note that the detailed information should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Guiding dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoother evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG Artefakte will be able to generate a high value of similar patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative brightness. therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter regards greater structures. the higher this value is determined, the more will appreciate even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle link since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, you should also choose that small angle should generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as possible and choose your needs acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrative step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality which you received by selecting this option is only little. it doubles but the running time. we recommend it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. any setting of image error correction may be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take very long and take a high CPU load after getting off. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image error with minor Artefacts. the module is used on a photo that created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see, there is an autonomous black artifact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digios rmp was a powerful tool to reduce image data. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is a selectable image filter available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireous; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can consult this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photograph above shows a typical scene created with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a graining noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the lower-window details and the advanced setting for advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time limit values per pixel and can display the picture above the radius given in the picture and the colour in it is bent and thus smaller flaws can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter forward. if it is increased, it needs to be reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can not receive any more and noise or smiling.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole space can be removed or smoke tips. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance impedance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings will not affect the smoother process that controls the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve the image. these settings will not be controlled by the smoother process that controls the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges which typically seem to increase. however, it does not contaminate the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjittering damping. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear to occur. if it is on a minimum, smokers and phyenjitter may appear on the edges. it can easily remove pirate and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store up and loading: these buttons are used exactly to use. all parameters for smokers that you have set can be stored in the file system and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how spoilers your life can change. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct size was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose. the solution to sharpen the image is much easier than a picture. use this tool to correct softly setting and experimenting with the setting. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & standoffs digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo sessions.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts of your images. it is very well adapted to plunge casctures, cater, compression party acts and local mistakes linked to digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures. the glasses are made along the image contours and thereby obtain the content as it also makes human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture of texture. the texture is developed with another tool, the image error correction was developed by the IMAGE team of the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannology and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. than a lossable compression algorithm created some compression & quot; Artefakequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restraration can now be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a very long time and take a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation anytime by button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce the image as a photo with equalisman's noise.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on the filtering. the original picture is under (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures can be applied to an old colour photo, which was created with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts alleged by the Scannerlight and the photo paper. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug, tool Hotpixels allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos that were with a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project that are protected by Martin Dickies.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially in high quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel screen; there is currently no manual approach to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the picture darkimage. the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the darkimage directly in connection to cover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching darkimage to the correct image. note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and automatically loads it to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the result. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all stocks.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defectives at the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filter available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defectives in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 out of pixels will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels have moved with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing, in the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the correct image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug was taken; Vignettification correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. lower corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often do not even illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) by reducing the light and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor. telephoto objective show this behaviour also.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it has also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be possible, also with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharpen effects arise through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's filtering and color-scale ranges from digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter that is used without these filters. the tool is protected by a Centerfilter onto a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignettification correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is an optical filter with a aperture setting of 2, relaxes the density to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reducing it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Reinforce Leuchthickness, contrast and gamma settings: the edit of a picture with the Vignettification error correction is reduced the luminosity of the pixels. you need only to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the knob provides you only positive values as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-tuning of the expose of the target, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the & digiplug. image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettifier correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the lid in the corners and (2) the correct image. an image error correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious membrane is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient is treated the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar effect effect, but eight to the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient is corrected the remote corners opposite the second gradient. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values can be corrected tonnage forms and positive values of cannular distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth gradient. this value is stronger to change than in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the 'facets parameter remarked the parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and performs the correction of the first Grades. negative values increase while positive the picture decreased.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box with a preview the distortion of correction. values you use for your image, are stored and used for the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or CO2-shaped correction should be done prior to all mapping or size changes. if you have a picture to cut a image and then perform a tons-shaped correction would be the effect of apparent error.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you get the best correction to you this tool is a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, like the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this spot. in the connection, you can correct the cen- / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a cold-shaped distortion is adjusted the resulting image of black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transformers cutting from the image processing or the zoom of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tonnage-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motifs like photos from the front, frames and paintings is the perspective to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you have the camera with the hand you will always have a slight decrease of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is listed below (1) and corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimplicguru.org website that can be reached under this URL. the filter is reproduced the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust film gradations and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob has changed the amount of film grains and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter canals are mixes for reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, because the colour information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmear used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is listed below (1) and the image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the trotter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film dial is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce filmstrip on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films. the manufacturers of large silver-baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film turnout effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street-gracious, graceful sight specially in your monochroms photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-grained effect on a black / white image. the original image is (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the top selects the pin size between one and five. thick brushes are better for larger images. smoothing controls the smooth or, from the other side view, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the edit is characterized by the (2). pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity control to create a cabeskizze. the lines whose gradients are slowly change, so you could imagine what scene you would have chosen to skate you. this would be good images to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving the picture in 3-D, as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monogamy scenery.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the painted picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work through distortion effect. it uses the protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in cells, and lets it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture in an art work by means of imaging effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Series: wiping the image along the sensitive lines that go out from a center. this simulates the imsharpness of a zooming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiant unsharpness: wiping the image by rotation of the pixel to a central point. this simulates the imsharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wiping the picture to create a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement sharpness: wiping the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the imsharpness of one linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photo, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soften: wipe the image soft in the dark and powerful in the bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtilting incandescent sphere.</seg>
<seg id="620">Layer imsharpness: wiping the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the sharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the colourings in the image and wiping them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation anytime by button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool to make raindrops onto your picture. this makes it a natural look for natural images. it uses a natural Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allowed it to alter the size of the drop-size. because the sample size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. the number of drops changes in the image changes on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stop using the & digiplug; imaging an area freely from raindrops. use the tool to choose the area, e.g. a face, who shall start to stay free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the range will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regulate filtering. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the worked image (2) indicates a sunset in a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the pop-up menu and forming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo puffed is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a picture at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to resistive is simple. the big question is how to keep up a picture and see the details sharp? how can you obtain the lack of information? how can you see the lack of information? how can you see the lack of information? how can you see a good job here. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo set the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. choose a change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size is using a linear interpolation method to burn the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational software programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digious algorithms was used by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in a tab New size and will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain page-ratio: if this setting is enabled, the size ratio of the original size will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter regards greater structures. the higher this value is determined, the more will appreciate even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly. any insertion for photo can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast in what it makes, but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load after getting off. you can cancel the calculation anytime by button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by using a small color on the double size. the original (1) and the enlarged picture (3) is the result of the linear standard magnification by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The feed of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a frequent underestimated tool to connect to a picture. to cut the mouse, simply drag the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the cheques, then you will see this rectangle below the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos would be cut off. this allows you to cut a good overview like your photo after the cutting. you can create the size of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by clicking it easy with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the check-in, use the button trimming button from the tool bar and the photo is made (Ctrl; + X). use the file size save or save Save In the menu file to store the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview range you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In tool Folding the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in the portrait aspect ratio, the larger value of the height and the width of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding aspect ratio is used for aspect ratio. meaning that it is always equal to whether you are using centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons are available to display ally horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog box you can set up with the Max. ratio button in the range for cutting on the size possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Followers its aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are stored as standard dimensions in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected the cut-in image, and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions help you to flatten out to create your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third paragus, harmonic triangles is an opportunity to share a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden center is a pitch propellates onto different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus Shell or the blossom forms of a sunflower. it dives in all kinds of things we can feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the error number 1,618033988... and it was used to create your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times, when you have your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is headed by the Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two previous numbers. a composition that is usually followed as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid aid lines provided when you have a picture:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral gets you good results for your photos to achieve good results. in comparison to third party produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric flow on this species.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called the golden quadrangles. it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition. this one can be a line or various objects. this one can easily be turned as without the eye, it will satisfy its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also from the above mentioned golden spiral. their vertex are the middle points of the sides of the golden boundary. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not an equate triangles. diagonal can be published as a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect of professional photographers, dynamic symmetry. try to place your image view at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach other.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror are used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the knob color you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines in your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free press is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle. you can repair it with the & digiplug; imaging and the tool-free rotation. choose the right rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are set in degrees. with the button default you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right-hand side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">On your help, the Module can position a horizontal and a vertical line. after you move the mouse pointer to the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now just adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you can find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transformer cut out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option grieve the picture a bit after rotation. however, keep the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspine transformations are done by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview is then recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that you can help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angles on top: shows the current angle at degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle at degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After that you have adapted the perspective, you get unbeatable triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to bersome this is the picture with transformations of cutting out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shaft tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. this module allows you to start transforming this module.</seg>
<seg id="679">Create your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you are using presets, the angles are displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right and the new dimensions of the target box are displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and a horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out, the picture will wipe out a bit. for a single scraper, this effect is usually negligible, but two scraper is created twice as much mistakes and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the picture, the picture has triangular triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate this is the picture with transformations of cutting out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digios; requires a number of libraries and other packets to read and write. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way as these libraries have compilated. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of images with & digials.</seg>

<seg id="727">& knoteviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphus; -dot; Graphene. & graphs; programs are free layout programs. & nographic viewer; shows Graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & conqueror; (such that a modification of the Graphene in & Kate; representing the Graphene new and in graphical interviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphene in & Kate; open the Graphene in & Kate; in a & Kate; Component to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="730">Charging of large graphs (currently, there are problems of around 1000 knots and a hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">More required software: & knotebook; is a & kde; program that requires the graphic arts; tool & dot; for the presentation of the graphs. you need in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphics, each in a own subwindow. initially, when you start & knotebook, the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo. in this case, the tool bar will open only the symbol file and the (empty) list. click on the first icon to display the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview of the corner is displayed if the Graph is bigger than the drawing area. you can choose a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and low without special keys, left and right with pressing & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just modified in & nographic; charged file from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the Graph will be re-loaded or if you want to ignore the change. & knotviewer; can you know your decision to change it later, you can use the menu settings of graphical interviewer; see also, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a Graphite file outside of an ongoing & knotebook; instance, if you want to open a new & knotebook, you will choose whether you want to open a new & knoteviewer; instance, or want to display the angular graphs in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unleased graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. this is used by the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is also significant with statistical differences in scale.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm created for uneried graphs a jump model -layout. it uses the Fruehman-Reina-Heuristics, and includes a multipurpose trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The circo; algorithm uses the node circular to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then specify a layout command as a parameter, and the calculated layout of the graphics according to stdout in xdot format. with such layout command you can give & eg; algorithms special options, or modify the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphs (directed or unloaded) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for unleased graphs).</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization can be used to localize images of geographically in the spherical coordinate system that is used by GPS and Galileo to localize. height, longitudinal and latitudinal are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your pictures with geographical data, you'll need a GPS trace as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Figure Geographical localization of correlzer. this interface can lead to a number of selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu on. the above-looking dialog appears to download. in order to load a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file, just like the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, a automatic correlation was performed in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum timepiece is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the variance is below. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlated all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in min. can be used if you don't have any matching data. if you know that a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set this limits here and then correlate this button to the interpolisher.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set by this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same place. since the dialogue, you need to use just the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map after and to be set. select the relevant region and enlarge it again, until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the amount must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang GPS data on the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to add a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums by using HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set will be encoded as UTF-8 encoding for best possible internationalisation.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which you can adapt to HTML. you'll need to select all the albums. you'll need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right-hand side you can quickly choose a large number of albums. in the area below, the screen will be displayed and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side. this rider is largely explained self-explanatory option. if you then click on a picture you will open a new page in which the picture will be displayed in the picture. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Cickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated pictures. choose a folder made on which you have written permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the default colour depth. the file size also affects all other settings.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider front pictures allows you to fit some of the settings from the album riders for the diagrams, which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="830">If the module creates the pages will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the Programs in order to determine whether error while creating. the web browser is automatically started at the end to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and can be used on them basic operations like turning, zooming or move. the viewer can be used with short bees and mesh. it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After launching, a picture is shown in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change pictures without sacrificing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is the file size increases, as no compressing of the color information is taking place. this also applies in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata moduls you can copy data from a picture to another. select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please check expropri2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Codierer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Codiers module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert selected images and image Magick. between the individual pictures you can add a base image file. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally you can create a background color for the slide. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD file for your DVD player. finally, you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to install the images that are attached to the MPEG Diashau. then you can start the module via extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then placed under picture files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting of the pictures or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you are choosing the file from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD decoder. in case you are planning to select the file on a TV, you need to set the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image process is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast of very smooth aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="849">In doubt, the background color can be set next. in doubt, you should put them black. the name and the path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file. keep your prompt you like.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start the film into the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink it quickly or in all tranquility a coffee, and enjoy the slide show you back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packets on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet paper together in standard Photosizes. combined pictures can also be automatically used with the Image Processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to print you or print it with Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your RAW format stored in one from three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line-tool dcw by Dave Coffin. an original score by Him is: expect from dcw not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera manufacturer. sometimes get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for white abuses. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A quadruple RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion results are equal, and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are frequently used to edit your pictures or later, you should not need to use JPEG format, as it has only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are using JPEG format, the metadata of the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to stop this process, you can break it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The launching mode allows you to convert various images at one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual pictures. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the file automatically. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress report shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp can be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image or enlarge it. to this end, four types of the image change are available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the aspect orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. accordingly, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, use this option to adapt your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed when this option is changed.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepare the image for the photo prints. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target pattern, including background size, boundary size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred E-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the number of pictures before. further pictures can be placed on the list of making pictures there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images will be displayed with the images shown by you. you can add additional pictures above the button. for the last image you can select a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw images on the picture list and add it to the list of the images added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">The pictures will be removed from the list of selected images from the list.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message -window of your e-mail client. you'll need to add only the addresses and the subject. pictures of the selected pictures are joined as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails. it may be a good idea to send more emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used any time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you need to specify in the input field including the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">In case you use the Google Mail Service, you have to install the GMailagent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file the comments are added to a text file and added the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats as e.g. TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend it to JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you are using JPEG pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifails will be added to the leading images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will automatically shut itself down, so you can view the status messages when looking for errors. your e-mail program is automatically started at the end. with the button closure you can cut this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diashau, there will be a window containing questions such as you want your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">Option OpenGL is used in the presentation to use very elegant image outputs by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graph card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file names indicate that the filename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>

<seg id="889">The images are randomly chosen to select that the pictures are displayed in random order. so it is not the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images you can set the temporal distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should mean that you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between whom you can choose. random chooses every transition between the pictures a different effect.</seg>

<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not have any documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under de-imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Module is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submentions, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, see picture. as you can see, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture you are now in each group, thus in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>

<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & knotation album; and watch the quick-up, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start the demo album, and select the demo album, if you can start & in your first dialog for the first time, or select the menu entry for your first time, or choose the menu entry menu. as a result, some example pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of & knotebook.</seg>

<seg id="917">& cold album; provides you two possibilities available to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & cold album; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following section of the user book it is described in & knotation; integrated version that you can create using the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages have to be created, you have to make some settings. these are divided in the three areas content, layout and target. in the following each area will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the transferring and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on track album; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & white album; export file will be created on the review page. ferry information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page. therefore, you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. for example, all pictures are from a party. please note that all pictures are exported. you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how to look like the HTML pages. most importation possibilities are clearly, so it is not received specifically for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below you can set different resolutions for the pictures. as a result, those who have to view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the dissolution at any time you can set up at any time. thus, it can display your pictures with low resolution, as if he wants to get a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, place the different folder and the URL to where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. thus, you can select either a folder, or select a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check whether this really can choose all of the viewer. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you want to specify should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser should start the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you will not have to copy it manually in the final target folder, see, correctly you need to specify the final target of files. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The right adjustment possibilities have all three basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is laid out, whose name can be set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & knotebook, you would like to create a HTML page to viewing the images. if you have already turned a lot of time for viewing the images, shooting location, etc., you have to go with & knotebook; this work must not be done again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & D album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the Bildeigenons are importing and imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you can distinguish it whether the pictures are saved with the file or if you want to save all the pictures in the file, so you can keep all the pictures and this file is so independent. the apparent disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file search the images in double-way. first it is looking for the images you want to have in the folder of .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following form, the dialog for Export Pictures, which you can exporting from the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether it is to act for internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When converting the .kim file, you will need to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically put into the .kim file, copy & cold album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not to compress the files. if you want to compressed this, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is file size limit. if you can send your friends pictures, you don't want to limit the pictures otherwise in full size, since the .kim file would be very large. here you can say that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & cold album to import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder you want to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category of persons to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be asked to imported the categories of the imported file and correspond to the categories these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can reserve the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It needs to be easy to browse images and view: if you look at pictures, you can view images of your Italy holiday information and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook, you will see the various steps from (1) to see the information about your pictures, about (2) and see the search for up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was begun as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this handbook it has been talked about pictures but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& cold album; saves all its information in the index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a diskette or revisions in CVS, where you want to back.</seg>
<seg id="950">& knotation album; shows the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future start automatically. if you want to start another folder with pictures, you can start playing & knotebook; with the -c option. as an example: knotebook -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry default photo album; set up... proceed to a window where you can change the settings of & knotebook. in the following section of the user book you will discuss the various possibilities options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can call the options of preview and the options for viewing the viewer. for each setting is a detailed help you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described here, as you can set different properties for any picture, e.g. persons, locations and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog box, which is used to allow already existing groups. you can select a label and select a symbol for each existing groups.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the subcategories the subcategories were already mentioned above. in the dialog options you can setup all members of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a gliededs as shown in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In a list of setting options you can choose to set membership units. with the above listed list box, select the category you want to configure. in the left window side you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& knotation album; its modular system with other graphics applications like digiplug and glove. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. you can find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called over the menu Modules. the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not partnered out of & cold album; however, most modules have a help page that you can create over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with multiple applications, it may be possible to test the modules with & cold album; for example, you should always try out new modules first using the demo file using the command &gt; kphotoelectric album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say, I don't have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that can use the modules via KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & cold album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you divide functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & skies, and other applications that can also use KIPI, is that the other uses are not supported their pictures in albums: this kind of order is not supported, it simulates some modules the order to albums, so you can use the functionality with & noff album;</seg>
<seg id="962">This album simulates & white album; the current album that is simply the actual view, so all the images that shows the picture preview currently shows.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & knotation album; the modules also has a list of albums. this goes to a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & B's album; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then every entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have defined in the setting dialog for the category of virtual albums. if you are using the category persons, you will be able to receive & spare album; so do if you might have selected persons to view and to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since several modules with & knotation album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setting dialog and select the modules installed which modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you can start & flier album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see at the top a menu and toolbar. at the moment it does not look very much information since you have not yet come back on this window, and now click on the entry images to show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & knotebook, is the opportunity to see each picture with notes, where the image has been taken on the picture, where the picture was taken individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks at the same time. if example, on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures have been recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browses, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this note when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In the event you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & cold album, as you can always use it again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the move of the pictures within the list: if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 frames the same 5-10 people can be shown, so that the names of the names are shifted upward, the persons can be found faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a list of illiteracy list, click on the icon for sorting to date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes on each image, you might want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with notes. click in this case just to the front and back buttons, which are located under the picture of the picture to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, for example with the same person, then it can be convenient to mark all these images and add multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all participating in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a superiority. in order to show you a special symbol is shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Anperative alogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can also move an entry to a category and put there to make this entry in a subcategory. attention, this assumes you make your categories alphabetically and see.</seg>

<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame in a frame. if you want to get back this window later, use the button options... and then window will see a / off. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all the pictures if you have no filters. you can configure the size of the preview photos, simply follow the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you make a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture will set this picture as a background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in picture viewer. if you still don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. select the corresponding pictures from you want and press either the button-button or select menu click menu. now the window will show you on the picture you can see in the picture.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed properly. when this manual was written correctly. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the symbol Renders The symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s INI files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can easily insert many Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or menu View menu, select the following dialog box:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each channel mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can put the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box section and give the image section to renders the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can choose the characteristics that are using & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex diffuser retro-lighting. an exhaustive description of the Render features can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture with only one beam per pixel is rendered, various errors can arise. these pictures often have a moirky sample or lines in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing, to reduce the influence of these mistakes. in general, pictures featuring this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn anti-aliasing, then connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called Super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive to the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel continues to split again and adaptive to the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray goes a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values steps to the adjacent pixels will be adjusted to 4, then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1-r 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixels will be traced individually and to further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set to the depth of the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the Strait process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering, changes & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; to calculate the diffuse light reflection rate. it takes very long to compute a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this box card you can set if the alpha-channels can be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent if the matching radiation has no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povable; scene, select the menu entry file importing... and select the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler is currently Supported by & Povray; if in case of importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & cpovmodeler, please send this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povable. this adds the source code of the object into the file. to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor and draw him in the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is called a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on assistance in your own view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povman; user documentation to the displayed object. ask the path to your document as well as the version. supported versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example altitude data) in the paths to the & Povman; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene, you will also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Colour of the wire models. the second colour is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color of the control points. the second colour is used for displaying the selected controls.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the sight field in the camera view and in the window type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of the open-line menu. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and lathes.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Greater values give a more accurate wire model and thus better support for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects like the ball, you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high dimensions for advanced projections, all wire-model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature provides a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is depicted in a chess boards from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a bottom drops below the objects. the floor is depicted in a chess boards from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross edge distribution, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precisely to the parameters you will find in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can modify or create new window orders. in section window orders, as you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard-window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; the chosen window can be used at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Extant window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can create and delete a select arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window arrangement is identified by name. the name must be clear and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window structures. new views can be created by clicking with the button and select selected views on the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, where you anchor a new column on the right window, with box card you get a card-card screen, together with the previous view, and floating the view on the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povable; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow no more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all the steps in this guide, you should be able to use the ultimate but simple scene: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should be careful attention please note yourself, before you make sure that you use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to renders, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any error free, you see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-installed Window System:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get the menus and the existing icons of the tool bar. please read the documentation, so you can get a reasonable performance what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then choose the menu entry, so that you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene, which you generate. in particular, you notice that in the fourth open-model view (lower bottom). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows the result of the rendery of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on, see the contents of view object Properties in which the various parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povu, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that the camera has to change in the camera control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. click on the left mouse button on a control point and move it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button to use or the input buttons, the wire-model views and the object tree are immediately changed according to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene. you might set a crosswise (insert) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a controversial method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler is indeed a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object-tree, change the name and press the button to use or the input. in the object tree the new name is instantly displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-size view is now also showing the level, if also at the moment, only as a limited level. if you rendery the scene, the level extends down to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can view the object tree, you will find that you can see the entry for the bottom + prior to the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and move. select one of these options, change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just allow you to know some of these parameters. choose shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">At the moment, choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose the moment some simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the own view (name = floor-pigment), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments are only a mat black material because you have to specify the settings for the pigment. remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time using a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way to now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and sphere, click on the button to use and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you don't have the colour benches. here you have need additional settings. in the color list you need to insert two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do it even more frequently, but the chess board colour checklist can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the habitat each time you are in monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already perform just as you can already understand the basic work of & kpovmodeler. already, the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget the input button or the button to press), so the sphere has shifted to the floor, as you shifted the floor to downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, Renders get a seldom result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears as a mat black material. set in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you chose the ball, you can now add a material. as already in the ground, enter the sphere a pigment as paint:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the most recent object and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click on the base of pigments, select and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time, put some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values as in the following screen shots and click on users or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of the brightness and reflection already produce some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what capabilities you have & kpovmodeler. hopefully you have learned them much, but you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the Render will be reflecting and broke the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the mist effect. so the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will be able to see without a camera without the camera. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">You can select your file in the usual file dialog. Povable files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene in the last saved version recovered. all changes since last storage are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only choose this menu entry only if you have not saved any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last edit orders. this menu entry can only be selected, if you have to use Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or order an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for the setup of & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the key folds and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for change the shortcut. you can change or add commands to this option for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to setup toolbars. you can add and remove from this option toolboxes for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is one way to make harsh surfaces, without changing any bump on the surface, without changing the geometrical shape of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both Bump-Map and a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of this fundamental body. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is one way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">The app has a comfortable web browser and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either a window in the image of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & galley is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with Click & LMBn; or the Return Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply tap the first character of the file on Browserwindow. then a small input field is found in the right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file is highlighted by pressing return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">When setting up - & gickshow, there are five cards of cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the work from & gickshow. in the two other, short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser, the key code can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If the image is selected, then the images are open in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with background color, which you can set down below. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, load & gickshow; already the next picture in the folder while you still have the current picture. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option records & pick-up show; when donate the name of the last opened folder. at the next start, opening & check show; this folder on browser window opens.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams to fill a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. when window is bigger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color here.</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some features such as OSD is predicting that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesop.org.

<seg id="1260">That's easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, that's really! no! & amarok; uses a backend independent approach, therefore the real question are the media types supported by Gstreamer / xine / Arts / KDEmm?. as you see, we support so pretty any audio format. GStreamer can even support Text and PNG!</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the Gstreamer driver with the Alsa-Sink, the device must use a mixer for the same time and give the same time audio mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixers).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The issue of this command should help you in search of the problem-cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different ink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That does not do so. don't forget that media must be decoded first. you can simply select a white noise. GStreamer is reading the best option if you are reading a decade with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS decoding the data first. Gstreamer can give directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer drivers (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open your sound server with the highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artractor SUID is set.</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs, which can cause revert playback. read this error report. read this error file in your ALSA plugin file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead of GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably you are using the Arts drivers. use another driver (the xine driver has been optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts Puffer in control centre and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller buffer, the less jobs react, please help us to fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the Gstreamer driver, crashes & amperately; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installation of GStreamer, you must record all components. perform GST-Register to record all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # gstream.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish amaroK before!): - Download and install it. then execute GST-register once more than your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files (you will find the module folder with GST-config / gstril-config) and run GST-register once again. start now & buy now.</seg>

<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; read-out for & kde; with it can be easily read audio CD; s can be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many codiers supported by this WAV files (compression-free compression). more codiers can be added to the program (if you have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on your computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, this WAV files are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format, or in other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, to read out the & CD, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggging (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed. however, all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, but only the codiers are not used. if FLAC is not used, the installation is not needed.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is supposed to be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction on Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to circumvent an protected audio CD; do not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid easy purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup must be done only once (the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), after which the daily handling of a & CD has to be found. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which will be quite frequent in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc.)</seg>
<seg id="1504">It can collect & CD; information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the master window. on the side step by step, you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screenshots with descriptions of the register maps for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB file is based on the CD data based on request in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case first to connect to the internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when a encoder has been configured in the tab Settings menu - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so the option can be read from other encoder as standard. it's necessary to set up the encoder in the tab dialog box dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that a file upset file is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog for Settings to configure the messages (such as protocols, pieptics) for Programs (such as reading the & CD; terminate).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main dialog for & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set the Encoders). you will go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coefficient and compression ratios, and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should go lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are other such as' hormones' or 'Monkey's, which may be available for this distribution. these disadvantages are the low compression ratios, and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats to lose information by data compression, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may now have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above these bitrate the differences are less important because both codiers generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributors free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (for high bitrates), but compared to OGG, easily deep-deep quality for lower bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-play devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also being heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning 2009 - these devices are usually only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and compressing the compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This attitude should offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music from youngsters, portable devices and autism. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely love the absolutely highest quality without back view of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually-entered or automatically be collected from the freedb over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & audiocreator; and the coding program for creating the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodiergen, there is often a combination of program settings for the coefficient and these parameters. the manual or assistance to the codiers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD, titles to the keywords (english: day), if MP3s shall be encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & audiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button closure in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database to read / enter the information / input so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself into the computer. it is to be aware that here only by text is spoken: & CD; titles, artists, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translation) I'm not attorney. however, no one can extract the information on the & CD; more or less value, so you can't get rid of the artist nor the music company damage. all information can be obtained at a bummel through a & CD; business, physically or virtually preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; it is active a check box (Send of a address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address of the server does not seem to use (This can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator, used for the use of freedb, the geographical area should be used on the next common mirror servers. this saves bandwidth in the network and make the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freed.org provides a current list of mirservern for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the whole database can be downloaded or (usually written monthly) only the updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is duplication program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">It is rumoured that cdparanoia is used. if you want to be more precise, seek out in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD-CD. see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed at first if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the downloaded WAV files, the code can be chosen for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codiers package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution, before the coefficient may be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. more information about Kodierer are located in the Chapter of Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a body, more information about his switches will be replaced by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg. console). thereby 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many reasons. check the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc.) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step Example. even if you use other settings, you can do it as you need to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything they understood, but somehow it is still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to create those areas exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to create everything and create our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer installed. both programs should be considered pre-compiled packets for your Linux distribution as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is sure to have write permission (eg; by trying to copy with the queror anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & audiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what must be repeated for any application & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding factor for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are used and what structure is used. since we are lazy to use the program, the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read a & CD, if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is delivered to the evaluation program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real instrument name of your running process. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is also possible, a look into the file / etc / fstab as well as an attempt on using existing records of device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The box card General Settings. here you don't want to do a lot. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be planed / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information, so you will be informed when information is missing to the use of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download on the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet in order to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selective field is simpler, a & CD; record is found immediately if you are not satisfied with the database entry / file names or day entries, they can easily be changed. the directory entry or file name is changed using Konquee - &gt; rename and tagging the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, you can use the option efields and freedb. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider it twice if it is worthwhile. to make freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected at least the first. mode is set up on the following boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings on the Internet access, for retrieve the & CD; information from the freedb server about the Internet. how do you know the system to get the CD? read the section about freedb. do everything as shown on screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your proximity. on this way the load between the host is distributed. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will work identical to the server, but many Firewalls will bounds the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the web.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transfer & CD; data to the freedb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply apply the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, there is why more than one at the same time when using existing drive? parallel. reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; cast off after reading the last piece: cross it on the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: if you cross this file, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored. if the box is not crossed, the files will not be inserted in the private folder. don't forget this folder, if you want to make anything with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on screen photo. the command is a little bit long, under circumstances, it must be blamed to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo equipment. the resulting bitrate is in average approximately 224 up to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creating tags on version V1 / V1.1. '. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of later amendment of tags.% f and% are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: on a dual-core or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizing structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is described, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each active & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, check the screen photos as a little differently than the data for a & CD; with successful retrieve deleted data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data will be manually loaded instead of sending them out of the Internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD has to be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length in the window should be listed, as in screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and could be identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for questions and answers following the help or proceed to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully by the freedb, all the titles are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that it is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key to your & CD; lets you select a window, and you can select the database-entry, which fits your opinion on your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings dialog for Settings), you can also manually extract it by choosing the first button in toolbar. if you don't have any local database, but you will need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD, according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Current title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field may be used for the individual comments infiltrating per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieve of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to begin the content of the CD-editor (e.g. whether all words are starting with major letters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags for the artist, album and titles of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you set ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed this option is set up in the 'basic settings' tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can even create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all Kodiers or file formats. check in the Help to Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is apparent with the style of issuing CD; this example is not important because we don't want to transmit the & CD; data just don't go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album already are filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. enter the title of the piece for each case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a unit. only the titles are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or make sure all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection to read the reading process, this window appears to be confirmation. click OK, and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to change to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be displayed in the left part of the window at the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you are attempting to work with a codiers, which you have not yet installed. pieces not marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in this example. have you checked if you have read write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: contract 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3. thus, read and coding parallel. notice the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to inhibit this behaviour. the only machine that is configurable, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and coding (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order on the waiting period of Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be embedded in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator;, you'll need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button. it appears again the file dialog box with which help you can select the required song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setup Automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatic add to the collection is added, a piece is automatically added to the active collection (using file or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection, it is activated by opening a piece the temporary collection and emptied. this collection will then add to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the tune and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played. if you select the series after the drop-menu of the menu, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove them or random order in the menu, the order will be refixed.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a tune, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button in previous piece, the entry predicted piece from the menu or press the button arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection you to delete a collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, it doesn't matter because it is not stored for leaving & cmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet, so becoming a trumpet while playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite color editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file showing all necessary modifications for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section can appear only once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. but it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END define KEYMAP "A further Keymap... END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that it is necessary to display that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map-file as an e-mail to allow you to come in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard, the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the principle of equality is ignored. it is assumed that the GM crop protection are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also do not use line for any of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-keysTo M is used to lay all the tones when using this instrument (GM-patch 127), you can remove a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a forbad. this is what you do not apply to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (cracking shot), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, irrespective of which the sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch which is meant with every tone a different percussionist instrument (drum, tank, Maracas & etc.) represents and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (such as some keyboards.).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify as sounds on a specified channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as their availability. you must therefore produce 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keymaps for each channel and one instrument. you only need to use several Keymaps only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymola are used primarily to make tones on the percussion-channel. check out as an example the Keymph.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to other. if you want to replace the first and second channel, simply make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you are using the Keymap option, the corresponding keymap must naturally be defined in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored on this channel. in this case you will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates, in which ratio of pitch Bender events can be multiplied by the value n, this is used with the formula * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used thus in the Map file no decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is giving that a pitch Bender event is to play with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to one octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI settings. you will find the Settings menu on Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these clavibers you can see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument onto a particular channel. if you have changed a instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to display that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played tones. view in the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. for example, if you will find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about it like a music piece. it contains the music, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can forcing you to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer. you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binge (rpm, deb) by & kmid. that happens because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't desire to add all the files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Understood, therefore & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before, activate the setup Automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can download the arrow button to the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to double the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -work with my MIDI folder and & kmid. in this way I have to play an MIDI file (if I like a karaoke file play) or don't want to play a file, merely go to the & conqueror; - windows switch and select the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">When you want to listen to a file just once you want to add a file, turn the setting Automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will add to the temporary collection of added files</seg>
<seg id="1692">For example, suppose you want to play MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mithy. so please insert the setup Automatic add to the collection and open A.mides your temporary collection, then exactly this is a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join the B.mid and C.mid to capture and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen these songs or the postcard, animated me to continue on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I've studied mathematics at the University of Maine; Laga. at the moment I'm not a lot of leisure for my hobbies, but I try to give me a bit time. as Hobbies I have program to collect MIDI files, music and play sets.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me really a huge, if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file of a local group. you will receive a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to contact a MIDI file, you should contact with me since I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have a & kmid. I wrote & kmid. I would like to get money in my leisure time. I would like to do this, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from the so-called andockable windows. there is always a window with the central view. and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is returned to it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to specify preferred links under the menu. if you want to create a list of entries, which are played by each other, you should use the category thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional Hierarchived, if you want an entry, his group and all its subsets are copied to the current category and start playback begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and thumbs can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do if & kmplayer, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category climax, click on the menu View and next processing mode. by clicking a subgroup, the XML content of this section is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to choose from the menu on the same with playlist and select either the processing mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes go lost if the processing mode is left or another group is selected without removal of playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and pressing can be deactivated by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changer [General Options] No Intro = 0 obtaining option to '1'. if the option is not available, you can simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer, the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / / .xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at start does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would disrupt the application at the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos; & lt; & lt; & D; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif / mum.gif / mum.gif; & LT; / t; In the source package of & kmplayer; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring the MPlayer configuration dialog for & kmplayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the intermediate memory size of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here's the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured through manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-Mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & cturplayer; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & kmplayer; flash 'can play back in HTML pages, the & kmplayer has to be used as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash in the application dialog file assignments for KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is used in a consoles application and release error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend is stored inside & cms; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus, a given backend for a particular Mime Type is taken (of course only if this also has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon to play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV maps, either by player or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner must be configured to use and TV channels. furthermore, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer is the dialog box to use - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XV1. there should be detected, from which one will be selected (for example, PAL for Western Europe), the correct name has probably contained a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support can only use Xvideo, XVideo will also work (only the one that works out of video devices under Linux). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the video forlinux extension has to be functional for the X server. therefore, this configuration file must therefore be contained in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, the KMPlayer used for the sources are different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, source, pipeshides, tvsource, source source, vcdsource and vagsource. when enabled, they start playing with the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is to run as user root according to the connection of the device. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom appears on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly on why, every time my CPU needs to be checked for their performance?</seg>

<seg id="1759">& hurry; - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile; it is still possible to discover that any mathematical environment could not be closed. however, it is due to the modest appearance of the output file. however, it is due to the emphasis on time and loading.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic adjustment of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ Begin {command}) of & cile; automatically creates a idle line (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the menu setting... LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & latex; Concerning the document of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subtle the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">At the view of the document in the structure of the structure, the individual elements can be changed and viewed on the appropriate button.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be found very helpful. once a DVI; file was created, jumps & cile; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer for the appropriate line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font and is available in addition to PDF the appropriate output type & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, transformation, and print from DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the RÃ ¼ ching-search, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor were clicked, the exact opposite is shown in the & latex; source code. the precursor search is the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in & latex; source text, it is used for the respective passage in DVI; -viewer calls.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function will be used with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified using other plugged .tex files. when using a project, a large Master document can be set up for project developers.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and automatically displayed (if no error occur in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File extension: in this mode the DVI; file on the barge â it is going to show up. and there is not a call by & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Considering the processing tool bar the three large selection areas should be formulated. the selection areas have been developed for rapid integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The veriable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Additional information is for individual products such as words, joints, notes, or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Designation: with this command you will find a designation for a section, a picture or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified designation (selection above a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries. for & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & kbib; files can be easily written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name of GrÃ ¶ merit is used for the definition of the font. it can be defined for the main text, the joints, etc., there are the following font size available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">2 selection criteria for creating a new document are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings. 2. the document can be written down by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clamps according to the\\ documentate class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font. the font is not specified at the beginning, this may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above-mentioned source code, the & latex; source code has to be compiled. the simplest way for this purpose is the use of the menu of construction or button construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored prior to the compilation. & cile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Finally, the compilation of the document command should be searched in the log file after errors. when using fast construction should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the log should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An area (English) is a text that is described differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 will be created and then only a few south look. the command\\ Begin {A},\\, and\\ end {appartement} so then called the extension of the font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will be supervised within the environment (from\\ Begin {A} to\\ end {Extra}). there is no restrictions (numbers) for the surrounding modifications within one area.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibility to increase the legibility of the legibility and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, subcutters, etc. are added to the end of the environment. these commands are either associated with the\\ 'command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is long until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be applied to\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; drawing language is illustrated, a step-by-step instruction for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant a bit text was entered, a few customization for the better readability of the document should be done, some places in the grease and cursive pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>

<seg id="1955">Automatic reset of accent signs: controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the corresponding coding during inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime Type: mimetypes to detect various types of files. using the standard, the default preset can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or in other way open to open files (where the encoding of the file can be transmitted). however, this setting will be emitted by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting will be emitted by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative aplus; creates a regularly backup copy or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document of this backup. this is not the same as the saving of the file. also for other stored documents, a backup will be created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, testis & quantitative aplus; if the required information is correct. please choose the store also if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative aplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redesigned. the support for the non-built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was discontinued, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead of whose, a debugger plugin concept is implemented that allows different implementations to plug-ins.</seg>

<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. will usually appear in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all mounting points, with line numbers and conditions are listed below. is usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view where the output (as in HTML) of the debug is shown. is usually used in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the Debugger, everything is available or part of the following functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this promotion, the connection to Debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plugin with, on debug requirements. this promotion will be triggered by default if a project is used, so that a debugger must not be counted on it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counter piece on debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to Debugger or terminate the listen to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Shows the debugger to begin with the execution of the script and the currently loaded line. if this happens when the script has started, the version will start before a debuggets started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The debugger to begin with the execution of the script file, without information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens when a script has been given, the version will start as soon as a request will start.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include files.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next directive in the script, whereby it is possible to include in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger to go up and go to the next so, than there would be the current not.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featualogical, the & quantitative data; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a fast delivery of tags in a document without risk of a typist.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing as a folder. they contain only the & eartionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML, and declared whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have better viewing and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations are explained in simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur in one document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains no-element type over itself otherwise nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a chioring and a methodologies. the arguments that will be handed over to the method. may empty its or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">One container day that grouped the elements of a list. it can only occur at a attribute description only once. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">The position of attributes can be fixed within a dialog within a dialog. this day can occur at any attribute within a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; - day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for any field in dialogue once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags: this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that terminate one day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All day XML files need to begin with one & XML; Declaration begin: & lt.? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be tipped and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">No spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & D; characters. these should be replaced by & LT; toolbag &gt;, & lt.; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and have no leg, but some pieces of the work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog will start in & quantitative aplus; windows to start and check out TagXMLA. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, checking only when charging the TagXML files in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & LT; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this day XML file is to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 day XML file. in this file a & PHP; Excel function is described. the file name of this daily XML file is to be overload .day.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A action can be fixed with Settings... created. click New Action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This can be assigned to this promotion. with clicking on the user button a key name can be assigned to the one button.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful shareholder type. using this promotion, external applications (usually such as scripts, but it is not limited) that can change or as input (or parts of the document); yourself are the quick start-dialogue or the different See in... Actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As first, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to find the% skriptest while command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we have replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of local document needed file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantitative; trial. if by & quantitative aplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative aplus; by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above-mentioned methods there is a script entries of & quantitative aplus; at the default setting. input field dialog can be determined, which is to be sent to the default entry options. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input is usually useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the issued application can also be redirected. there are two kinds of output: normal issue, printed on the standard error Edition. error messages can be done by the default output written by clicking the value field issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the case there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar is added, you must add actions and configure. select Settings Actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action Knopt at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and when the day attributes and you can plan their use, activate "" "" Edit "" "" when available, so that a input when using the action is possible. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignore! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & check;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used as standard 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit tags.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting head as a symbol. due to the use of green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signalized a message to user, click on this symbol no & lt; -day in current document include.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be linked to the action. this happens on the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selection of the required action. besides the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and reset them with other tags, so there are still what there are, or confirm with OK to finish.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some usual & quantitative caplus; functions to the tool bar supplement or it should adjust it to better overview by some separators in multiple groups. open the toolbar dialog for Settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to pick the Trento (at the top right) for my tool bar. after selecting the element, which should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview for example a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the Trento support the group. anyone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; push the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by stating all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it becomes imbal file, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right file. please customize their tool bar (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quantitative extension; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formattation language, which would like it. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; Documentation 'for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you may review in & quantitative aplus; -Repository if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatification / script / etc. -language. then you need to create the docrc file. we do not need to treat the docrc file here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc You = Path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Your description for these documentations such as & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = (1.html html 1 = landmark 1.html) 2 = function2 = functionally tag2 = tag2.html day 3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defined the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see in PHP & PHP; documentation like something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Links PHP 4.2 Exhibition = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html .html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = parage.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it shows that it concerns the sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess player (except of Reason) mdash, but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents of the directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequentally, at the top end of the building site & mdash; file is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">No spaces influence nothing, but keep on & down; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & D; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; ressources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of docrc file, which is used to appear in context of a & PHP; scripts for the context of a & PHP; H for context-help would display the documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connectors.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of suitable context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docs docrc to store up to $HOME / .kde / Me / apps or $KDEDIR / editing / apps or $KDEDIR / editing / apps or bps for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docetc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these are well and it's worth, you will send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantitative aplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud of them being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus; you are not alone. it is possible to distribute the resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an Email menu entry, such as DTD DTD (DTEP) with email, tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive of where all the other & quantitative aplus; users can download. the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication, for what it is a GPG / PGP keys. this means that our team is ensured, both our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG-key (the Passphrase is not saved) or in the case that you have several keys, you can proceed in a dialog box New resource (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking on OK the load can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can also be Upload from the menus DTD DTD (DTEP), toolbars toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the scripts and scripts tree started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of a resource, still using & quantitative; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and the Signification. in case of problems warns it and it may be canceled. if the integrity were given with signature, a message appears with specifying the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet able to work by a DTEP package. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion is possible from the DTD loading and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the strings written in! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Precision adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantitative aplus; after converting the & refusal rc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative aplus; there are several key concepts. to be able to understand and make full advantage of & quantitative concept. this chapter tries to create them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative aplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative aplus; the working range is divided into three areas: global, local and projection. these differentiation affects a number of components in & quantitative aplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone who is using & quantitative; uses, available. of tool bars over actions are all that is marked with a common folder of & quantitative patterns; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tools, actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development equipment for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in a user directory, so that they can use only this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. all elements can be made specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction work, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please beat in, and further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the carteireiter with the right button of mouse to reload a context menu with the current Document which passable, delete or upload the document, skip to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click here to add a further context menu regarding the updated document content, such as basic processing steps (copy / copy / insert), edit the file under mouse pointer or Open the file, if the string is described under mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor, the toolbars of the editor are currently representing & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bars is displayed. in the course of the expansion of & quantitative aplus, the tool bar will be adapted to the new features and thus related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really light. if they want to insert it into a single day, then click the icon to insert the day. now, you should insert the data for this just entered. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT) allow it to open and navigate in the information about & quantitative aplus. in the representation of carteireite are available for files, project, templates, documentaries, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative files; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right mouse click. promotions such as removing, upload, upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantitative aplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depend on & quantitative aplus; working range starting. global templates are always available, local templates for the appropriate users and templates are only available in the project. more about templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of reintegration into the global, location and project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can download the right information on a script, such as the script will start to process, edit or send it with an email.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project, since e.g., after filling the project name, the whole list structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information may later be adjusted with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (eg. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.examples .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you can use this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol is used. depending on the remote control it could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. when a joint collection of files will be used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. with serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) one must go different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check-in if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project started from scratch on a new one, not haken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be shown within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to thinnings.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by plugins or, by removing the check box, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three adjustments which can simplify your work. these settings can be uploading in the menu pane with project Project Properties in the bottom window profiles or with the checker Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some adjustments are described in the project assistants and are described in the process. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible), which are reinvoked in project-related operations like the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The supplementary option can be listed above, even files that are listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project can be loaded when opening the project. more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed is found in. the debugger plugin can be adjusted using the checkbox. in case the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom window profiles can also be set uploading profiles (see in), as well as the display of a construction view for each profile, by using an own construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower-window event, one can switch event actions and modify these promotions, change or delete all events. event operations are executed if a previously specified event appears, like the sickness of a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, quantitative & quantitative; the last project which was opened. this behaviour is currently not influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu Project or the icon Project will open from the toolbar. the dialog box will open and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantitative aplus is closed, the project file is automatically saved, if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitative files are found. the same happens if you download a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder is also provided, but are missing the entries and opening with the right mouse button on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removing of the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button is cut off to avoid the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and if you forgot at a program. this option is useful if you need to upload files needed and the rather unsafe password on the plate is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2184">That will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative aplus; many high load profiles can be created and so the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing and create a profile will be displayed this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server where the files should be copied. either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this must not be changed, except the network administrator, one service does not operate at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, it is either a timesaving function or danger. use it to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming language can easily see it in clear text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it may be possible in a project a lot of views, i.e. by easy exchange of view, and replace various files and toolbars and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool bar, attainable via settings of tool toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative aplus; to which one can do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative aplus; to the own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantitative aplus; best via the toolbar toolbars. use and add up. Adding tool bar will be handled at the section adding tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols are set to be set either by using the context menu (right click on the toolbar), there may be different actions such as tool bar, toolbar rename or toolbars, what can be specified in the dialogue, which may be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action updated which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and promotions to them can set up in the menu with Settings... and Settings Settings....</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essential document labels, code-escalopes and files to link. & quantitative aplus. you can copy, postpone or any of the existing folder made available in the previous tree. designs have shown in & quantitative aplus; in about the limitations listed for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative aplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions on the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; binary templates are normally inserted in documents by shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the advance tree of a global templates. further information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate ways to make efficient. some examples can be found in the advance tree under global templates. see more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a whole menu on a JavaScript or Perl basis. some examples are in the advance tree below global templates. see more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be summarized in a folder plate archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File As template to save as local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out the tree structure under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and select File as template. alternatively, select the selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and arrange on the constructions template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy in a previous file. it can be used to use all file management functions such as pulling down or insert on the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder icon or create a folder icon to create a folder on the right and site template. by default, the project folder is secured, but of course it is also stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal oriented approach. you can create headlines and dynamic with & PHP; create, insert files or linked with them. in addition, some things in use of templates in projects are very deep-found in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the basement window is based on the files used in $KDEDIR / share / apps and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates / apps. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled as soon as a termost attribute is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all apart from the common folders. if a trunk can be adjusted so, it would be explicitly enabled in this path. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is probably in a common file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Forward or shown text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or underlines for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a file with special headlines / foot lines a whole presentation with matching headlines / feet lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have the context menu (click on the right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative aplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites you to edit a document such as a normal & HTML; or & XHTML; then you can edit and run as needed for source code editor, in which the carried out changes in the VPL; editor are visible in source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor to a document that includes & PHP; it is not possible to edit the Vohandeli from & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; there is no plans to change this behavioral behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes in the source code editor and in the VPL; -editor are synchronously running. using F9 this mode is already active, the key pressure of the active cursor from a window to others where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The sync distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... In addition, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation is valid for quick calculator and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the title of the website. this is also called the editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor is also called once a new document with the VPL; -editor will also change it:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing two buttons at the bottom, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword Keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design your pages in the browser. it is possible to add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete. an amendment on the list is exactly as with the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to integrate a external CSS style template by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is like in a word processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is intrinsically safe. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by plugging and extinguished by button or distances.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insert of tags is made in the same way via the toolbars as in the source code editor. it is necessary to note that the tags have already been added to existing tags, e.g. an anchor day, which is inserted with text, must be removed every other surrounding anchor per day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen-assistant are disabled. you will later be used in & VPL; work on this release shall be used for tables or lists tools.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of stylistic templates. in contrast to other programs for stylists, search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style can be traced.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; you can compile besides & kde; still the libxslt libraries, libexslt and libxml, which are present with a typical installation of & kde; already present.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why so & diffuse 3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contribution made many changes and simultaneously corrections the objection. another programmer had changed in the same file a lot of text. the result were numerous conflicts during meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me did not show me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the inclusion of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So, this was the beginning. the first version of & diffuse 3; could represent differences in one line and changes to white characters. later there were added a lot of further useful features.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you would like to compare text quickly, copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the reference windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which did a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently in one piece of cod and make changes. the merge editor will show the resolution of conflicts and shows the outcome. in this Editor, you can even edit the outcome. this screen saver shows three Quell files to merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; helps you the same and complete folder. this screenshot shows & diffuse 3; at the folder meeting:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; displays the accurate differences and distraightforward the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check this function, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed clearly. if rows are distinguished only in a certain number of white characters, you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble anymore, if no one changes the deposit.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the tipwork easier by writing only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual entry of file names, the selection above the file browser (file...) or select one of the last opened file from the list box. you don't have to specify a third file, if you have to leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also choose a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge files will be selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If you intersects, the input field is active and is not necessary. however, it is not necessary to specify a output file immediately. you can also do this step later while saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare all the file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active reference window. the comparison starts to select no files, you can simply close the dialog with button 1 button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and shutdown: move a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall above a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes you would like to figure out how many similar functions. if you would need to figure out how similarly these functions are, would have to compare it in & diff3; load and compare these relevant sections. now, you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can extract nothing from & diffuse 3; remove only the bullet of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and placing text into another program as a cut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains characters A, B or C, the file names and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional). (if the path leads to a file, you can rest the mouse over the line. then a little aid window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sourdough are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, you can see the color that file is different. if both files differ is the default color for this red. (color for conflicts in the settings). colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left in addition to the text is the Comprehensive column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding colour. if white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are relevant only in strings and few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the Comprehensive column of the text is interrupted by places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line turn is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparative windows) also has an info-line with the inscription output:, the filename and [Geert] if you already have the result. normally, it contains the automatic compilation already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! through all conflicts are disbanded, the saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the next dissolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, every difference at the same time has to be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (therefore, the group is then highlighted in the windows where the group is usually highlighted.) This group is then highlighted by the color background color for the current area and on the left is a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, thanks to the automatic merge or by manual processing, no more line will remain in the group; this text is only a placeholder for the case you can change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you may copy and add differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge tiles; however, appear in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or commentary are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates will navigate mainly to the image afford and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, side, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. you can also click navigating even to the navigating system.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can use the other buttons to do pane. using the Insert button, you can switch between adjusting and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns is synchronizing the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section assembly and the editable output window was declared).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all dissoluble conflicts must still be regarded as conflict. therefore, between solving and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this is enabled, you can select the copying files automatically into the clipboard. however, be careful if you could see the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenrols are stored in accordance with the included operating system\, and Win32-based systems use car return + ceilenvorce\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line files of the source files, therefore you should use & diffuse 3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last files used are automatically stored and reproduced in the next start. (menu items &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script of fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog displays writings with variable width available, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, differences in curve sequences are displayed. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered. on these systems, the button settings will automatically display an unconditional color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tab key is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you enter or return Return, the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. manually copying the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & diffuse 3; first, all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source files. only in this step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters will not ignored in this step. also, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) storing a car folder '\' at the end of a line, but then you could store files with different sizes in page-to-page comparison, however, when this option is activated, however, this option will be disabled. during the result, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default setting is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', ') are ignored in the result, the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default setting is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is activated in the default. it is effectively with complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically skip mode, this setting is determined how long the results of the selection will be displayed, before the next turn of the next conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white characters by choosing the chosen file as source. (default is useful if white characters are used in many files less important. if you need only from time to time, use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in chapter to scanning for folders and announcing a merge. see details below documentation for the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version contains the suffix .original, if already a backup file with the suffix .original, this is deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not require the current program. you need to exit & diffuse 3; finish and restart if the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set to the control center globally.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, for all entries the upper setup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for the encoding is a short notice that the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and have an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this means how special characters is treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">For example, if you have a file, you can define which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define the processing line, they may not work with your codec. (e.g. your files might handle 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output files.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off to inhibit the highlighting of changes in white characters in text or overlook. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or reviews if the options have to ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a color-coded overlay column are displayed. but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & B; C, A & B & D; C, C is still indicated in addition to the normal still a second transformer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply cut off the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Specifies the comparison chart by side or superior to each other. this can also be useful to ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files. a simple click starts to merge and uses the file names of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, you will first pass through this external command. in & diff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own predator, which is exactly your needs. you can extract this function e.g. to extract interrupt parts or for correct use.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is specified first to this external command. if also a standard pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only when input is equal. you can write your own predator, which corresponds to your needs. every input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow more flexibility when entering the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program the good. the good news is, however, that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line crossings to input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergent expression of the printed text on each string. the\\ 1 is moved on the found text in the first clung. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other compression control systems use some key words to include automatically generated character (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all following the same pattern is $\ '\ _ BAR _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with SED, you might be able to understand it and perhaps you may have this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line abuses. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is one suitable matches, and each hits will be slightly deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may need to perform multiple constraints at once. then you can use the semicolon '; you can use the conditions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead SED you can also use something different such as perl -e -e -e -e -s / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allergies are different from perl some details. where SED\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the lead\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be kept for displaying and to maintain. further operations change only the data that the line-like-algorythmus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences, you can not see certain differences, and in the worst case you will destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you have to edit the programmers in a folder of files. from this reason, you can compare and merge together with & diff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making a proposal for any object; you can customize the proposal in front of the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate simulate and show the simulated changes without them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you only need to open file on the command line or the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no target file is specified, used & diff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to press the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform a little message about the recent progress. if you abrupt the folder of the folder, only the files will be listed, which have been compared to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is finished, shows & diff3; a listing window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and each folder that has been found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded. you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - button. the directory menu contains two functions All signatories are folding and all subdirectories can be folded if you can open all the folders or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When double click on a file, the file comparison starts and it appears a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in different folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object. in such a case the compreshr action can not be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture you can see in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the colour is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if you are full content. then you have the same color. at folder is the age unpleasant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors reflect the colors of a leaf that's first green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red will be red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy from A (or if A is not found, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g., if a file and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the result cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g., if a file and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the result cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronising is active if only two folders and no explicit target file are synchronised and if the option may synchronize directories. then select & diffuse 3; the necessary action, so follow both folders. if you want an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible file names for the output file only B; directly after the merge copies & diffuse 3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge (unsafe) then check & kdiff3; the date of files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. solving such bugs can't be removed, the merge file cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During bringing a file after the other hand, the status column shows distance, if the merge operation was successful, and according to other messages, if the merge has been completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is right in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If using the dialog for Full-comparative Analysis, KDiff3 is shown further columns. these contain the number of unlevies, soluble, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soluble conflicts will be shown only if three folders compared to or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either execute the just selected entry (file or Odner) or any entries at once. if you have selected all the intercepot actions (even in all sub-gatherings), you can start collision.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified any target file, then in the three-file merge mode C it is used as target, when using two-folder merge, B and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder correction. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keynote tag). to merge only the current item: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting file types still invalid, a message appears on the incorrect elements, and you can choose a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you complete all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options to simulate and break the options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you want to see what would happen without the real changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diff3; then resolve certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge to a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select again directory entry / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it, an appropriate dialog appears. then, & diffuse 3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diff3; appear on a mistake, you will find a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you can help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you have to skip the problem the cause of the problem or to solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, see & diff3; those entries (in the current session) and does not execute all entries again. even if here the merge files are not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you complete the merge action, these entries will be re-guided.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & diffuse 3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit the specified patterns will be displayed in the element tree. separate placeholder. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default file size must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders also correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders also correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. plenty of autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder is made with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems you have a hiding place. in other file systems it is a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is shut down, symbolic link values are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to the links below. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searches. (note that if the option contains a link to itself) and go to diff3; discloses this option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistic government. (the number of soluble, unicasteries, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files which do not contain any text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great folders through a slow network, it is possibly faster to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed should not be higher. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to the Change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered to be identical if they have lost equal. this option can be useful if when changing the changeset date. please do not use this option. this option is activated.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activitize the synchronize mode if two folders compared and no destination folders. in this mode, the suggestions are identical. in this mode, the results are identical in both folders. this option is switched off in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences to merge the copying of the newer file as a action. (this is considered uncertain because the other file is not changed too. you should check this option in any case.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or file is replaced by a different file or deleted, the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original if an old backup file is already exists, this will also affect the normal interaction of individual files, not only the complete folders. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders merge view would be visible to the merge files; you can switch the divider divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the option into the window menu and switch main window between directory and text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file by double-click. however, there is a single file directly together without the folder. if you want to save the folder, the status will be done directly, and the file will not run again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you read the directory once again: directory menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote host.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first line arrows compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second line arrows compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undo or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space character &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is assumed as an link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or changeability date. therefore, the permissions or changeability date from the original (please note the option of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as the differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts always the built-in differences viewer. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the viewer viewer and then select In KDiff3 part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & diffuse 3; two full input files. if it is used as a cPart, decreases & diffuse 3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & diff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can select a patch file and choose from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this doesn't work unless the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & diffuse 3; as Part 2, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Comprehensive). furthermore, the name Kdiff3 has already pointed out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone these track or follow him.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure prefix to KDE. in default, KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you can find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters occur differently, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if you'll be treated next to Each Other, this will show this. this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor register for every difference in the files where it starts and ends. that's necessary to save a conflict by clicking in the source text and select the Knopt A / B / C. this important information is simply saved when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been so far too large. you can use a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit more large quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text, no src left; released and the text is not extinguished. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diffuse 3; already use many colors for creating differences. even more emphasis is confusing and lacking the purpose. use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubles came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & diffuse 3; you'll need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You can find information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & use diff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & diff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir provides the folder in your system installed in the KDE. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & diff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems when piling. should nevertheless occur difficulties, report on the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Sealing (Ctrl-x or Shift Delete) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift to insert) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences in files: files that are identical in all folders can not appear in folder, and therefore not in target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in current version version, you need to update the folder to the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries indicated that the differences may not be copied to the target folders. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is probably amended in a later program version.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they are removed when clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. normal differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a mini-preview of all virtual work areas. it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the spaces to change their size or move them. this works both within a work area as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpens, can display all virtual space areas as well as in the ongoing applications. the applications can be selected and even moving across the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpens; the movement is also possible in a work area as well as other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button has clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpens, click, the context menu has only used the two entries of pager. I clicked on the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries, maximize, Upon Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. it appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. it appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, will appear in & kpager; the names of virtual work areas are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets you see the & kpager; numbers of virtual space surfaces. if it is crossed with name, the name will be with ordinate numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of every desktop will be shown as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs will be shown as small windows in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty work areas will be displayed to allow the selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple, simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with the standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpens; the main window can be determined: classic, & kpager, as well known as pager applications in some other windows. horizontally shows all virtual work areas in a vertical row, which is very good for the display on the side at the side.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature range in the Control bar. it has the advantage of changing the window as symbols or with its contents and postpone. furthermore, it runs outside the Control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; followed by selecting the switch... allow the dialog for Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, that cannot be changed in dialogue settings. however, you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vig. if you have no writing permission for the file, you need to register as user root or register to your system administrator. in this file, you need to specify the key windowtransparent mode and refer to this one value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package is debase, you will need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen magnifying. you can read with & kmag; a part of the screen can read a magnifying glass. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with a visual deterioration. this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of & kmag;</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very efficient application which is constantly expanding with new functions. it is optimised for use on performance weak machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you see & kmag, a window appears above. the main window of & klikes; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window will be called the magnification window.. The image that is displayed in the magnification window is a enlarged range of screen and is designated as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, it can be increased & klikes; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile left. alternatively, you can see & kmay; in addition, a selected screen pitch in the magnification screen (select window) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer on the screen side (eg; on the left screen deck).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor in the enlarged window is displayed, select the cursor position. please note that it is not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the select mode you can adjust the selection window to your needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can move the contents of the magnification panel and move it with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are additionally the & Shift; press and push the & MMB; you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the select window will remain and just the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& klikes; possesses a lot of features. you can copy the enlarged picture directly to the printer, copy the clipboard (to add it later to other applications), the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starting or stops the ad update. the stops of the update causes that the required CPU time goes against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, duing, medium, high). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode a selection window will be displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer is a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer from the RSI syndrome (the repetitive strain rate of ignition syndrome) and each mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool: emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer is a little while on the same place. it's meant to help people that mating every mouse click pain. Moreover, it may cause them to emulate it with the mouse. this, however, requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool: can cope with pain, which is using the mouse, and helps to use the pain of pain without pain. unfortunately, if you are caused by the naked Move to the mouse, you should try to search a doctor if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To alise it even once again: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain, which are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain which applies through the protection of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic user means, the result can be dropped out differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is smart moving activates, makes & kmousetool; a break when it is pressed by pressing the mouse button. in this way, you can execute the toes when pressed the mouse button. the smart moving requires a little practice, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, this residence time must be taken before & kmousetool; a mouse click exit.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is the contrary shifting unit, the setting panel shift time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the mouse button is waiting for off before the mouse button is waiting, if the mouse is still no moving because of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on foot. if this function activates a slow motion to the right and back, followed by a break, click on the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time you can change it later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can rip & kde; do not move the response time. open there, sound & multimedia, select there sound system and here the rider. there is a slider sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is only available at & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please refer to the relevant documentation that will start automatically as you start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">All settings are set to the values which have been set when opening the dialog. you have already pressed the button to user, the settings are reset to the level after pressing the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best when you use & kmousetool, first use by default. especially the smart move should be switched off at first. if you are used to click the automatic mouse, you can later go the smart moving.</seg>
<seg id="2510">When you use the audible click, it's necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; if you are using sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware, in which places a mouse click with no effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on the browser window, which doesn't make link to uncertain reactions. you can park the mouse to such places until you want to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is pressed, you should clean your mouse, that's usually rather simple. the trick is that you don't only cleanse the mouse ball but also the roles you come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. like this happens, is from mouse to mouse differently. it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">When you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles you can see. these are mounted on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you just start an imperation process. if you use the smart moving, it means that & kmousetool should stop the operation no longer through the letting of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; below a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here. this is the status of & kmousetool; returned and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries to execute & kmousetool; continue to execute the cursor at another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of mind if you do not want to make the mouse over a neutral position unintentional reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer and eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the frontlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I do not make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shift is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time to move it into the clipboard or want to move it into the clipboard or want to move into any other promotion. however, there will probably be some problems to prepare. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Just do not use the smart move, if you just start to start & kmousetool, to use. select text instead as follows: execute the mouse button pressed while you move the mouse over the other end of the text and again reset the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">In this way, use the audible mouse button. this will always be played when & kmousetool. so you know exactly when when smart moving the shift period begins. later, you can use the smart move also without the audible mouse click here. however, it needs some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you can use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case in most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and set them correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool, pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI Syndrome and the staffection of the mouth pastes pains.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktops; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is processed before it is sent to the program of the program. they are useful for the improvement of the language to substitute wrong words or abbreviations, select a matching speech or narrator or to handle certain shortcomings of language synthesis and their votes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working methods of filtering, it is important to know how the program "HR dispatcher" is working with a text and distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen-Reaars have the highest priority. it will be preceded by all other applications and will keep these orders. if the issue of Screen reader is read, the restrained orders will continue resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; Processor is getting hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output from messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message suppress normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the news. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome you just enter the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are easy text assignable. each order you are used by boxes boards. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text applications. lyrics are intended for the issue of longer texts that have no particular glingness.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in maintenance, with the exception of the issue of Screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a precursor, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First of all, you need to know that filter is never applied to the output of Screen rears. they are applied to normal warnings, news and text applications as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter make the text and keep it next to the next filter. at present there are three types of filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are designed as modules. in the future it can still be types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replace parts of a text by text and replace parts of a text by other text. it can be taken either as words or as a regular expressions, which has the replacement of chat-emotions as: -) by text or for the transformation of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; included in a format in another format. included are some XSLT files to the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can order orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program, which sent the text to & ktts, sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice on the box card, you can read text by KDE messages about it. Siehs. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has set the rules on which it is applied for a language issue. if the filter make sure its rules is not correct, he gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; Notification of & ctal; sent by all activated filters, which have been set on the page below. machining through the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the set-up filters. if a filter does not intersects, it is not enabled, and will not be used. filter will be reproduced from the series downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters, and it will be shown below the following set dialog boxes.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set a list of words or regular expressions, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if the text is replaced by the associated replacement text. large and small statement will not be considered as comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can select one name in this name, it must only be distinguished by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column. the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can download or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store the current list or delete. download a list of file stored on the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language written here, the filter is only used if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also hold multiple languages when pressing the mouse click the & Ctrl; button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is written here, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by computa. example: counter-mail, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will be available with the qdbus program; the & DBus; numbers have to wake you up. if, for example & qdbus; the application ID-3432 has to be displayed, you can only enter your head.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The animation filter is then applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the boxes sealing filter apply if apply. all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">The words used in the form\\ s Word\\ see in comparison of words used in the form\\ 's Word\\. the words must therefore be restricted by separating characters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical user can be used like a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but also the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic networks will be published, in the second, all by & knetworkconf; file configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information on IP networks. only basic information on the integration of the PC is mediated in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 5 is never found wide spread. it is expected that it focuses on the future. this description focuses on widespread use of IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of an interface interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrators to be configured or if available, the IP address cannot be chosen as desired.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When applying your own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially chosen area to avoid IP address data using the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines via setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks to up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask was set to 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are subscribed to the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route is needed for the IP connection.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The adress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are described by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically modified in DSL connections, so it was not surprising, if in case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE Linux, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a sickness program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it provides the ability to create several archives on a band. the first goal was to create a question for the fast, selective award. the second goal was the answer to a question that caused my wife: how much longer does it take if you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & dat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; moil the band back and read the pretensioning information of the band. detects & kdat; the leader in the band cannot be asked if the band is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & kdat; the spouse, it searches after the matching index on your disk. can this not be found, you will be asked if the tape index will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything goes smooth, changing the symbol for the tape drive to display that the band has been bound. in the Status Bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched through the fold of the single entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before leaving the belt, first payment has to be solved, there are three methods to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen through a modification of the symbol for the band that the binding for the band has been resolved and shows an appropriate message in the Status Bar. the band can now be rejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat, it can be used, it must be formatted by & dat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape types must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not require the formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drives must be formatted, it must be done before using the band of & kdat; usually, the tape drives are usually formatted as a formatting of the tape drives, DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the band is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it is only supporting this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a profile profile in the tree. only those specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with one herkets. only those marked files and / or sub-folders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Fechoes menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog for backup. in this dialog you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialogue appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the directory entry for the drive. it is checked only the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files in one of the files for the band with one herkets. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in any of the archive and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was launched, the dialog appears for checking. in this dialog, you can check your selection once and change the folders for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking, the dialog appears dialog. this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can slide the restore, the files you need to be restored, can be marked with two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives created for entry for the tape drive. it's only produced the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archive with a bunches. only those selected files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archive and select menu restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the unlock procedure was started, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialog, you can check your selection once and change the folders for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for restoring, the dialog appears to restore. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexable file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing indexing files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backing profile with the straight selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup is to be made. the list of the secured files will be updated automatically according to the relevant work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder that are placed on other file systems, can be used separately on backup files. each entry will be viewed by tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup file, a snapshot file will have been backed up since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used for determination of changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of knobs files & gt; lt; and lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu item KYOat... in the menu settings. the following settings can be set:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path for the belt drive for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band bound the command to the drive. when some drives is necessary, this is necessary before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The option is switched on, tries and dat; the start of a tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, if the binding is switched off & cdat; automatically the band is discarded. use this option not to floppy disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; the hardware-level block size for the tape drive. no all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this attitude is active or not, you have to use & kdat; in any case the block size is required for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat is formatted, a band formatted, writing a file to the start of the tape. this file should only consist of a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format ID. the format of this character string is the name: seconds, being the name of the full name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can be administrated directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not around incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup association. this symbol is only active if a band is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksysteme log; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system allows the various protocol files. in addition, & check boxes log; experienced users using quick access to information on problems which appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksysteme log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the task is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system decides on the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & check system log; experienced users using the quick access to information on problems which appear on their server. & ksysteme log; therefore, some extended functions can be filtered and analysed with the help of the Protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 possesses & ksysteme log; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and will be explained in other chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, it displays & ksysteme log; features available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file are easily filtering and sort; the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries to open the system log, the first major message file of the system - the system log has started. it is probably not displayed with system administrator right. the protocol files can be found under Linux normally in the / var / log file, for the normal user does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filtering the filter bar. in the default setting, select the list box next to the filter. in the default setting, select a protocol line only displayed, if in one of the columns select the strings of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select an other entry at this spot. the strings of the filter search term is then simply select the column process, and then carry out the filter bar into the name of a process, so show you & ksysteme log; all Protocol lines, which were sent from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines. record lines of level error are displayed with a conspicuous color than Protocol lines of level note. the colored display of Protocol lines can be switched to.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the protocol, or in the cron protocol), you can choose the process identification (PID) in the column process. this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command as for example to start the samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines within the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksysteme log; allows the ad to open multiple protocol files into separate underwindows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you have selected a window window, select menu of the Display menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksysteme log; has a dedicated website on http: / / ksellers log.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further current information about the use of & ksysteme log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksysteme log; find also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksysteme log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init is quickly developed as standard for control of program boot at high-time system in the & Linux; world. thus, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and also more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init system.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go on historical aspects (amongst others, because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to do a machine at System V Init, without a new installation and new format. that is why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc are directly in / etc. this folder name rc..Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you wish to start the system or upgrade to another round level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once launched. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if it is not much use for this. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something, what to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for various places after the init program and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default level is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default factory level 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair anything, then you can repair anything, then reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you ls -l enter in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, every record here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d list.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts are written that there will be an argument like start and stop. you can start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script will stop with the argument, when it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore I could have a user level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv;. it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is easy to say to say trivial: simply drag an entry in the field of availability services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts themselves between runners or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere. thus, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or his position). this happens only if they extract an entry from the availability process services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed when you move them into a new area. to choose them, select Copy from the menu pane or choose from the context menu and enter into the target range -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting box of a single entry cannot be calculated additionally. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. be careful not.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various work ranges (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc.) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of top or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move a entry into another round level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; x) and add it into the desired level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting box or name of a single entry, press the input button to open the tab dialog. use the dialog button to accept the changes, or press Esc to refuse the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default is the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise it will be available. otherwise, changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard-leveling, and now the machine starts continuously. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Specify at the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default level on a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have set some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details on the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services in these distributions, it simplifies the configuration for the proprietary structures of this distribution, but unfortunately does not require a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension to the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please verify whether all configuration files are required (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) is easy without message if your configuration files are not available or untrue.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send information about the runlevel to make this manual added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you'll need to save it. either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry store in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards of cards, user and user group. for editing, select the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialogue user and group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended limits (Quota) for users, a box card will be produced, if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master .passwd are installed as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map file password will appear if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master .passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This box card is only activated, if for at least one embedded file system is activated and initialized (visible at the quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be changed for each user parameters, the limited liability limitation in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for any file system. the current file system will be selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Carteimap groups informs about the group of selected types of the selected user. the standard group where the user belongs, you will find in the primitive group. furthermore, the user can select in other groups by select this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog box features a list of all users. to add a group to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, add adding from the menu users or group or click the appropriate tool button to select the tool bar. the edit or deletion of the selected users or the selected group is analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the LILO Conboot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change, change, and more.</seg>
