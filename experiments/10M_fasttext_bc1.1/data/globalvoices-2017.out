although I visited the United States at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read about American music , American authors , and his sport .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found@@ ly deep effect on me that I was mostly conducted by a American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ ful repor@@ ter who covered a mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spi@@ racy by Julia Roberts as a Jura student . the Supreme Court judges whose interest were inclined .
I was caught .
free after Method One , &quot; I was it if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country to live in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inv@@ iting , that you are always that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equ@@ ine people .
I even wrote a very bad love letter concerning its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with his Eng@@ ines .
he never holds behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he think , like a former colleague , and proclaimed his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned to him for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can parliamentary elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support this big@@ u@@ age person , I asked myself ?
I was able to kill Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ tors in harmony with the people who had learned during my period during my period .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world , a deep believ@@ ing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also Tr@@ um@@ ps World view is not associated with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also reflected in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced by Sandy B@@ ahr that I strug@@ gling for life long the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who received me like her son .
yet it adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who helped me with a lot of patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose arms has helped me much in my career .
those people and those em@@ itted by them are deep@@ ening my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidates , they gave me a stop and the equivalent to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its cont@@ emp@@ t of non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either represented by its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke me .
perhaps it is un@@ fair the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters than R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people must submit , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to us in that situation .
that is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters want to have tuned for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to win control over a country that they dis@@ ap@@ pointing ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in that America ?
maybe maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who commented on the cru@@ el@@ ly decision to raise a man who looks look down with regard to those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of white against all other Eth@@ nic , &quot; voc@@ abul@@ ary from white in motion to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones named , has the fact that America has so great .
millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have , America is definitely welcome .
for this land chosen as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ite , whose history , as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise to and says : to Hell with per@@ sever@@ ity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
in all these I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifest@@ ation for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word exchange with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , have my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the people responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have one place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were loud .
&quot; would anyone who is not like you have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God be than@@ ked to Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was put right .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and I will break my heart to me .

out of the mis@@ ery of the stars : these Latin American children are not able to destroy their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of Oaxaca , with the children of the par@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played at both places is not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby domin@@ ate Colom@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the community : a family of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments a possibility of over@@ coming poverty .
a music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oaxaca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the land @-@ violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project , and the youth had so called a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as - Oaxaca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion .
they always come and play with shining eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay - on instruments that are made of recovered waste materials :
music with recovered instruments made of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under management of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to make parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments are classified s@@ nat@@ ches , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music from the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remin@@ is@@ cent of the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sing at the same place , where parents had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them live not together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown that he had never seen before : a violin was produced from a tr@@ ash .
today there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and calls to The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation of &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spect@@ acle from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
this Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work could successfully fight against illegal f@@ isheries
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that combat the wild illegal fishing industry .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that informs about international and practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
at that time , in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in li@@ an waters of illegal fishing , before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were brought to this way over the dem@@ on and a little inclined , to welcome an am@@ ic@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar of this type at its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized quickly against the ship . they refused to feed one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Premier is surrounded by countries which easily refused everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; rec@@ alls the Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the sailing time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the area of the region : it did not succeed to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative which crosses criminal practices and resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ) in 2012 .
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar to six countries , which then sold the Premier from its waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are uni@@ qu@@ ed and work together . they exchange information and stand in each other when it goes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by the definition : what is imprisoned , is hidden , but because it is extremely difficult to get up . hence the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
a deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species can be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm balance , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal f@@ isheries were once proclaimed through bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the snow @-@ emp@@ tor@@ o , with the information between individual countries , tra@@ ce@@ able with tra@@ ce@@ ability at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
in there , the individual countries can replace lists of listed licenses , news for susp@@ ect activity or details that are noticed or learned during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i persecuted the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive when moving to the open sea using satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark Shi@@ ps that are used in forbidden areas - such as suspected driving conditions , such that a ship invites its caught fish on the go to other ships .
ideally , such tests can indicate whether the participating ships have a fishing licence if they were on the road and possibly even if they have a penalty .
countries that are protected against illegal fishing companies can refuse to the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to make the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a considerable losses for the owners , meaning that illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leader director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to spend an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year lose int@@ ru@@ sion because of the illegal f@@ ishers who are incur@@ red in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una f@@ fish stocks , which attrac@@ ts commercial fishing companies in all over the world , including those illegal f@@ ishers .
the practices include things include like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake roy@@ als , speci@@ fying of imag@@ inations , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weak@@ nesses of a complete organized control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , a ship was illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did not start my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ alized hat@@ ching tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 exploration of susp@@ ects .
it has revealed criminal networks to spread the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it tra@@ cked and found refuge .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International High Authority on Cri@@ me , F@@ ISH @-@ i can provide information on illegal fishing over large distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our research lead us rather far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i should have suspected ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships which would like to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very elabor@@ ated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO that deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems as you can &apos;t get any more of satellite .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system which combines various information levels . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find out crimin@@ ating ships with larger precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team of African nations can actually take effect on this und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly a global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Sea protection organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be rendered to the world &apos;s position of every tra@@ ce@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of it , he who is doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to join forces and to bund@@ les their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have to run a similar project when using a global system for the persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel det@@ ective , but also cri@@ es out .
ships that used to be conf@@ used without licence and hardly to calculate with consequences , do they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since then fishing boats have been purchased more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had put together Gre@@ ko 1 , insp@@ ectors found there on board towing networks , whose mission is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
even other countries notice this success . &quot; the effect is so strongly that us now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
there are six countries together in 2015 , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . even they fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model such as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to bring even more of such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a licence and were not allowed to be banned .
the ship was also ra@@ ced in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen in Somalia . &quot; with the take of action against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time the evidence is that such a special , collab@@ orative work towards the protection of oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
your article will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela is aimed at : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to re@@ claim &quot; the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela can only seem to be the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum of the President of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government had rejected the opposition of the opposition to a counter@@ part in the opposition , the Ven@@ et@@ ol@@ ans responded to the negotiations over the political and economic crisis in the country , in which they gathered themselves together in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the re@@ order of Venezuela ) can be viewed from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lands of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the German Bundestag on Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ated continuously , which makes it possible for lack of food and medic@@ ations in everyday life .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the order of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro a chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest articles in the context of government decree as follows :
as part of social , political and economic crisis , which is estimated to be the highest in the inflation and economic crisis ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is considered to be the only way to conquer the country , its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the election of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad &apos;s ra@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short mud ( about : a round table of the Democratic Party ) , who joined the opposition by the President of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . in addition , a twelve hours strike at the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government seat , should continue to continue on November 3 , the blocking of the refer@@ end@@ ums will continue to continue .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed fears of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to susp@@ end police forces , including these women in the An@@ den@@ staat ts@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
in the meanwhile grown @-@ grown man Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , the crimes were examined during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano not sought his life .
starting at the burden , same name as his father worn down to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation , I believed that it was okay .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years old you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know at that time , that my father was a thief , fol@@ klore and rob@@ bers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ an official . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence division 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed which was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities in the course of years , which he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court in his own father .
his story shows what great power has given a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me at the military base , I often went into the sports hall . there I had a boy , who made mar@@ tial sport for me .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and ur@@ ged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you &apos;ve got along with one of the ERP .
pass only that they must not make you one day and I will save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Rev@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of revolution@@ aries workers in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be in order . for so my father loved me .
on the base point I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University conclu@@ des , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ where the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he brought me into a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small piece of wrap and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were left and subjected to a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I par@@ aly@@ sed in , and saw a Lie@@ ge , tor@@ tured on men .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she was attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was fast@@ ed there .
they f@@ aded a man with hands on the bed , over@@ shot him with water , and pursued it for 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the st@@ ank there was t@@ aw@@ ful ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in distress .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much g@@ rief to another ?
&apos;@@ I didn &apos;t know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were m@@ illed with hands and were armed .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people went down with the face down - all were gre@@ ased at hands and feet .
near the entrance k@@ au@@ min@@ ed people still quiet@@ ly upon the matt@@ resses .
when my father noted that I saw to the det@@ ain@@ ees , he said , &quot; What do you look like this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you meet me , why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told you home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms , which were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to information from survi@@ vor@@ s of civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero is also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ribera Process , which is also called Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path , which you come in , is also the way to come down here .
when looking at the map , you see that they were about this path and tor@@ tured then for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of emp@@ t@@ ying a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of mankind and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of war &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things , at home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they knew it was .
but when I was in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I became clear that war is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military combat which one has fought against an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... others , then there is no war , but V@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked myself , as my father , who was head of security forces in that V@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do it .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and thou , who stand up cars on the streets ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded me , crying me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we need no one another !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in trial , I showed a photo of then , on which I bore a jacket and sc@@ oop of wool . both had my father of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothing at home .
then , the defence asked me to have been a mit@@ er for this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me on a burden for what they wanted .
I was so anyway to declare .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the final ab@@ h@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar A@@ kt &apos; .
now , where I am older , I think I Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recogn@@ ise that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been executed during the dictatorship . but why the bodies disappear ?
why to perform children ?
one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
one would have been able to put them into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill those people . but what p@@ ses are to disappear ?
had these people not even families who could maintain their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the final ab@@ h@@ y act , which can be attached to man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced again to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were shred@@ ded and no idea - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 Cri@@ me - including my Father .
the idea to display my father was taken during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience him because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I am killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt min@@ ut@@ tered , and asked me what the whole over@@ drive Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they are supp@@ os@@ edly def@@ ended , actually was good .
then I cried out :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed adul@@ ter@@ ful crimes and for@@ ged me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just did that .
in 2010 , I put the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
no one can submit to me that I am working out . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 416 offen@@ ders : including severe , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 98 cases , murder in 98 of severe cases , torture with subsequent death sentences in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ribera process ended crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 The op@@ pressed were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Court found life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were hands @-@ aud@@ iting .
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the process .
# La@@ j@@ la@@ xis : murder , torture and rape by minist@@ erial sentence . # Es@@ War@@ ster@@ ity
all the def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police authorities , and civil personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a de@@ ath@@ factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the Court is a historic landmark for all human rights organisations that have been working for many years of justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer , founded in 1995 , founded by H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who was murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government passed the country to La Per@@ la , making a memorial to be established there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes elderly people in K@@ YO@@ TO to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the shield with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can extend his guide .
the photo was spread in the social media .
el@@ aboration of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened Centre in which you can extend his guide , during the last month , witnesses of a very particularly disp@@ le@@ ased translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word ( codi@@ le ch@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe but also with b@@ ö@@ sem &amp; # 8@@ 212 , but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was reading from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself .
el@@ aboration of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , he was also who made the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n daily published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such a English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an insul@@ ating for older people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the def@@ ective English translation was first removed at first . the designation &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mat@@ isch is not the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture are re@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation of translation . furthermore , it stated that the error was already contained in the text that they had been checked out from trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was released .
a blog@@ ger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry we felt that older people were insul@@ ted through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounces as an in@@ appropriate description of elderly car drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents that are involved in accidents in the country , but quite a lot to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 , which equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens claimed 1.8@@ 03 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the percentage of seniors has increased in the same period .
the nam@@ efully mentioned repor@@ ter presented in the article published in the article comments on the light that show what pre@@ aches of some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo above the translation error was given the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does the translation be wrong , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure mines for this bizar@@ re error in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation is mani@@ fold .
you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of target language - somewhat , which is in the case of mother tongue . generally , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the main language - native language .
thus , a French native language should translate from English to French - not by French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese firms do not employ a staff with English as native language that could have translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , quot@@ as or the relatively low number of English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees , however , have to be employed , however , the Japanese staff , whose English language is considered the best to be considered as the best - no matter how good or bad .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the advert@@ ised and en@@ ig@@ matic propositions which are made by machine translation shows that this technology can replace yet long no human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gely English formulation in Japan , among them also the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry yet acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of large enterprises or from the government who have funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto will hop@@ efully use a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ation in the Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezuel@@ an Internet users , that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet connection from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will be no longer accessible .
other online stations also contributed in the protests of protests in Caracas , who were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that contra@@ dic@@ ate the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the responsibilities of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the findings of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is glu@@ ed and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ oli@@ thic issues are blocked again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces .
traditional media have been rel@@ ying on coverage of protests since 2014 . then , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation then threatened them with fin@@ es and closure , when the Commission would continue to report this as &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sine fil@@ in@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible via a blocking of domain name System ( DNS ) but also two more online transmitter . this also applies to the website , on which the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
earlier research institute of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , have shown that the local internet providers may use DNA . thus , it is a technique that concerns the DNS server in@@ quiries of certain domains .
if a website has been blocked by the DNS server , the server answers correctly or denied the request when calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS c@@ block : @ el@@ epi@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third meeting point , the transmission on Thursday 6th April was adjusted when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera &apos;s El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who took over the protests in Caracas , was detained .
Flo@@ res was beaten while sitting in custody for police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV resum@@ ed .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections : the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians make access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become a slave to get a training .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimonies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ ds , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , exp@@ elling schools , &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which she was not living together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her studies at the University , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house full of pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who became something has become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to work for the family . in Paraguay , they called for more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a great family with little money is giving birth to her min@@ ors son or her younger daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned above , is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and sacrifice of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised within the framework of the contract .
in Paraguay , this known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
in this case they said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dis@@ appointment , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one of the family that their daughter in the faith to improve their position in society so that they can make their position in society and &quot; something out of it &quot; can make a different family .
on the other hand , the family is that the girl take up and his exploitation with the faith just@@ i@@ fies that they would give someone a chance that would never be any training , and perhaps he would be hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will find out many years later .
sometimes they will never know about it .
so far , in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ lor in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but was a vision .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of severe stro@@ kes . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita at the budget of the former Military Academy of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official officer at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck the death on Mar@@ ín until they suffered dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they found that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela formed deep in the par@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest people and claimed that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; will be in Paraguay . &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos have been widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered &quot; , Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ aining .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the N@@ eigh@@ bours &apos;s neighbours and nearly 60 civil society demanded a rapid investigation of the drop .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo is sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girls who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case before court comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay were a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s case .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited for workers , they live also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik office , where her father worked , sign up , and lost his father lost his work .
her brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the road or market swe@@ ets to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
at the house of their employ@@ ers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
they had to share the time so that you still had time to learn to learn .
she got up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employer .
Friday , for example , they cleansed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end , she returned home and had time to learn .
the more they ever had finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time also was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a says she had to never hunger , but did not get unlimited food . I was able to get more books from the library &apos;s library than food from the refrigerator . &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ izers , the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , held during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings in the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him and editorial articles from the opposition newspapers like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to persu@@ ade the reports from the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator no belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them for intelligent , but did not fall with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had someone who list@@ ened to him while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not often to visit my family , because they think that I would learn that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ den@@ a , who would be the native group of Guar@@ ani , would speak at home again their native language Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had allowed them to lose her again , explains it .
but it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ crimin@@ ated in school . &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken , Mo@@ b@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ anas are subject to school when they go to school .
because the other children &apos;s parents have , they recognize that someone , who has no parents , is a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was unable to invite home to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time of friends , I felt particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that I was part of a group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company endor@@ se the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group where you can share st@@ ings for cleaning and children girls in Paraguay .
the administ@@ rators in the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please refer to you .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and lots of comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had an old girl and gave their phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary &quot; a girl from the state of the inner that I want to work . &quot;
then the authors of the display was once more :
Dear friends , I found one . I look like it works with it .
thank you , I am writing again if something is .
the shop was complete .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long ? ) , a collection of witness statements , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ador who received the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores at which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors had to be considered as a Hal@@ b slaves ) and in fact , it is not to just@@ ify that many girls and boys become illegal in a system of slavery , in which they become easy sacrifice for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the look of power are the key to the understanding of the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
Bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register in the government
picture by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
released under public domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently approved a bill of bill to &quot; the regulations concerning the use and commercial social networks . &quot;
if he is adopted by Parliament , users and users have to register social media in Egypt for government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a spot would then be set up , which therefore instru@@ cts the citizens and citizens to use social media .
within six months with the assum@@ ption of the Act you would have to register users on the site with their right names and staff numbers to use social networks .
if it is missed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others via voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how to en@@ act the law , as the draft notification has not been adopted , as the Egyptian authorities is not able to impos@@ e users to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not registered in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the Legislative Council , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks us . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary to submit informations about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site experts are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the fore@@ front .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; ) , talked to Global Vo@@ ices :
I have strong attention to the technical capacities and the understanding of any neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion it is possible to imagine that just as they are for@@ ci@@ ble to the physical public and private spaces that could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , this means that they must be a powerful surveillance system to feed citizens , which means a licence request or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to bring it to a judicial process .
this is technically not really realistic - but in Egypt all things are possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft proposal must initially be discussed in the legisl@@ ature of parliament and the constitutional committee before it enters a debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is not being successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with one pro @-@ military think in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different an@@ ings on the image surface is , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ ist .
last year , the president of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill of Legislative against Cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality , found guilty of life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan , in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protected H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq have sought refuge to protect the spiritual Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the fra@@ ction of their hab@@ itat , as they always find less prey , end@@ angered .
why is this particular type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video showing , &quot; is the Per@@ spective Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of ecos@@ ystem depend on it that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is low and goes against zero . when the team is therefore fixed , that she &apos;s a recording of a big cat at the camera &apos;s all , r@@ aza is out of pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ ica , R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which consists not only from war and conflict .
she has been involved in wild animals since six years and participated in wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq .
since 2013 she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and assumes that protective zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ out@@ o daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o achieved the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those who were affected by the &quot; Triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami of the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ c@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated , since the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish all the coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had a nuclear accident , and therefore some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper &apos;s detailed report contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves .
the residential situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( and that of it ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the largest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of all houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened its final lamp with 70 percent .
even six years later , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ avi@@ or , evacu@@ ation of you to settle in final spare parts .
after the Thir@@ ty Cat@@ astrophe , almost 80,000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ avi@@ our accommodation .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated in Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated persons lived after the disaster in Beh@@ avi@@ our accommodation , were moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , this figure is 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper , 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , have reopened its doors by December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing licenses in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now come into service , only 30 percent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have been caught in the area of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that just a consequence of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lie in the nuclear threat . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered far more , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again to 90 per cent on the same stand , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , there are more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
to establish a total image , the newspaper introduced numerous aspects of the native population and under the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their anger has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among native people experience .
the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local resident population have taken action to be prepared to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 per cent of respon@@ dents say that still lack of disaster prevention had been done .
as it stands for those being evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper has strengthened its attention to the location of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had also been the witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic prov@@ oking , the Japan had to experience ever .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement parts .
after 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ es areas most of the evacu@@ ated areas are older than 50 years old . you have to compete in proper conditions , because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come from other countries that speak a different language , the differences were first to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , it is often recogni@@ zes that more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important since they demand our advantages , expand our perspectives and recall that the world is ultimately very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in coverage than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember one moment in which they have felt very reas@@ on@@ ably linked to someone above language and international borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ voy speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish , Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i says , like a migration of their aff@@ ection for the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time , where they look back to the music of all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a wide spread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia took him in a demonstration against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest against au@@ ster@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull of brain trau@@ ma and several fragments .
physi@@ cians operated on his Saturday and have now translated it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures also shows the face of the police officer , which was attacked with a bu@@ zz@@ ling reef . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident in the case of active service .
the pictures show the police officer , such as he be@@ ats in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his com@@ rade on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would blow from a demonstr@@ ators and on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months , and the whole repression would be justified with that .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ay@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several renov@@ ations went to him .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the below shown clip , you see the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , which lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while living in the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás .
Go@@ i@@ ás experi@@ encing a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish of his father was murdered , because he has attacked the Occup@@ y &apos;s Military Police with a Gas@@ le@@ ck , and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a head@@ stock .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived in police officers for protest@@ ers last Friday .
polic@@ emen were shooting at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for speakers , rubber handles and dr@@ um@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , in@@ treated the police via speaker fail@@ ing on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha , S. Paulo , one of the oldest papers in the country .
again , the Brazilian media prot@@ ector once again de@@ coded by focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window pul@@ ley .
the Fol@@ ha of S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a frag@@ ile glass windows in order to illustr@@ ate their original cover pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o gave a cover story with a fixed bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of people than the protests by thousands of people who are in defence of a special thing .
this is necessary to recogn@@ ise if it is strict against any type of damage .
here too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are question@@ ed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; dismant@@ led on con@@ front@@ ation path with the police . &quot;
view from the Ab@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ ations For@@ gotten villages in Cuba
introducing the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba has closed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the community of the Gregorian de Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sug@@ ars , regardless of what there is no significant sugar @-@ harvest@@ ed on site .
it is two years ago when the activities produced in the sug@@ ar@@ cane factories .
after getting there , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost and after its plants , until only the s@@ caff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
around 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others signed and comm@@ utes to the factories which are still m@@ illed per day .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier veter@@ an who stands in the morning every day at 4 : 00 a.m. the crisis in the sug@@ ar@@ cane industry doesn &apos;t seem to sleep his sleep .
he heard that there are working in the east of the region of sugar cane factories which were once again in operation after long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene is remin@@ is@@ cent of having heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tube industry is already the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country before some decades , but the bad har@@ v@@ ests are no new anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the village saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and barely competitive , they were un@@ portable for the country .
initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories which annual production targets amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only left factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the antioxidant crisis in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased before about one decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar varies between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Nutrition Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the rough sugar would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; the day &apos;s day is going to enter into history , &quot; the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
it happened in the sug@@ ar@@ cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated in most , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first of the first year , the first letters started to come .
it was officially written about documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address , and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ f Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could make any withdrawal .
from there , the responsibility and letters were increasingly being more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the factory @-@ set factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , the insured .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will , at the dis@@ closure of the factory , where it helped to help .
with every part that he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ stations was removed .
in many cases there were no alternatives for jobs and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , then president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that factories had been in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane manufacturer
since 2004 , sugar cane will only extract high by VAT .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the Volks@@ wagen@@ de Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I learned that many things are changing , but not always to better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory decided or better , when they began to de@@ compos@@ e them , they also heard on the asphalt roads , it also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they were divided into spare parts .
without the future , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve once for the supply of the congregation .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene moved to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty of the old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no trace person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that one told him .
they have been living for ten years .
N@@ ene is working with 65 years old , not because it is lacking in strength , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations youth use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express yourself and get the own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First Nation .

teenagers of the First Nations communities in Canada do deal with topics that are important for them . they do they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , since 2014 , workshops mobile recording studios direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate groups of son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop puts the young participation in discussions on topics such as cultural identity , language , strug@@ gles , love , self acceptance , &quot; or what to give them always in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ bl@@ az@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia says , for example , the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway from tears , &quot; on which almost two dozens mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ hi Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , as important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers do not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song we recorded the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ Hop group who received them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an stands the st@@ rop@@ he in the heading , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like that no one would be interested in me .
but I try to go on the earth for my days
that is the day when you will receive our Schre@@ i ,
because we lost our way our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so , they grow and prec@@ eded by our youth
so , you can do that for why she determined the Creator

plastic dishes will not only be shown in the restaurant in Japan
some of a typical restaurants in Japan ( ... ) outside of a typical restaurants in Japan .

one can see almost any kind of plastic dishes in Japan .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed in the vicinity of the entry of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( showing that of the &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) is exhibited by each food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or proceed to the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a multitude of these small enterprises that produce those plastic dishes created by the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese those plastic dishes are so usual that they don &apos;t have to know them any more . a new trend , however , turned out today in a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin @-@ purple .
now in special sales : new with plastic gr@@ ated mobile phone bands that are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u purchase department .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ ten , such as in this case , cooling cabinet mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ c@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ments is increasingly being faced .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) is turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also have made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a Apple , holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , using a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Commissioner .
some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , any popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there any@@ body who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can &apos;t shoot my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only thing .
this interest in plastic dishes may also accept a less appet@@ ite form to surprise for example of colleagues or family members .

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ est and killed regularly appeared in statistics . however , this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this fight con@@ sp@@ ends .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a square , ur@@ ged the stories of conflict in the background completely .
the day after a violent incident , barely someone looking at the g@@ rief or communities that have learned to live with pain .
behind each strip , behind every bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves , stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds are perhaps to cure .
that is why the Mexican News Portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , &quot; ) which is supposed to give these victims a voice and stories from people who were in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes this project :
organis@@ ational crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are many pro@@ found .
for example , if shops will close because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and will need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear@@ ing life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who sear@@ ches on every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father &apos;s four sisters , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing to let &apos;s go back to the task that we have put off and go to graves , according to the people who we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should return again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you will go to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay it out because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show faces the faces that are afraid . we must show the international community of conflicts to show frag@@ ility and the state of state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports in high risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader made by Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Africa .
your contribution reminds us of what violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism now since some years .
I come over every day at newspaper til@@ ting and see the cover pages with pictures that actually are from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists can come from specialists .
it takes me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the one , the dead or sad . it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to that body .
I can not be the same or consider it normal .
it further writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year @-@ old c@@ ousin think that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is large . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , this is what they inher@@ ited the ones who have lost someone and those who have fear them also something like that .
I see our weakness when stories will be naked figures in a statistic only .
the Tat@@ en@@ nia of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances are justified by 43 students in a neighboring village that they have been living . &quot;
I think they are trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies while they are not ag@@ itate and still silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months Er@@ press@@ ung in the Capital district . &quot; it describes how an armed crime was spo@@ iled for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family torn apart .
you think all that you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain over it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely essential .
the further we are removed , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want that the others are arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will be taken or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , if wine would have a deep roots to dissolve feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten what you weep . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he puts questions on how , who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells that he himself had to bring himself to himself as one egg gra@@ ins , potatoes br@@ oth and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for all year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able to a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and the learning to live with that .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody Ly@@ che of his father , who had been shot by armed men from one of the driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was born :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence organised by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world , due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosec@@ ution counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8,5 Mor@@ den per day .
this are only some hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rating the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of a new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; is called Animal Journ@@ alism project , which consists of complex information behind the failed fight against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , which has pe@@ eled the country in the past four decades to present in a intelli@@ gible manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing &apos;s Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages to which it is represented , include pictures where power is represented .
the fact check is important in one moment , in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or a f@@ ake .
but how is the years since something emerged in the first time ? content in social media , whether true or true , incline is to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its initial release , it has been used to stri@@ ve in use , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact .
this mis@@ coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; within the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
there will be questions about our desire for messages to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car crosses the place S@@ ange back in the east of the DR Kongo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war in Africa , the second largest country was neg@@ le@@ cted for years and devast@@ ated devast@@ ation . the streets in the region became sufficient for dangerous paths of stroke , which were difficult to travel .
it fell victim to the victim of tan@@ dem .
local government representatives described a fire ball , the dozens of dozens covered , including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championships .
the houses are incub@@ ated and carbon@@ ized bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to know .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the advance form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body that can be b@@ lown up on the ground , while individuals can watch it .
but here is the story you end .
over the years , the same photo was put out several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , although real but not that in the context of the trage@@ dies are attributed to particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ gen@@ ic localities in the village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before they flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned in streets and prayers .
reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained to count to count , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were tender , shot or burnt .
only from the basis of satellite images , the following period could be illustrated .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ certain , but the army base in Bagh@@ dad was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Kongo on again when it appears as proof of the fact and the possible degree of attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , these mis@@ chief use of the image from the DR Kongo is only one in a series of mis@@ si@@ p@@ tions ; Africa Check has arrangements to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was brought to a cover for mass@@ acres .
another step further bring personal comments using the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange came also in connection with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a der@@ ision , published by the United Nations , ones who could flee , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , Post@@ s like the following , who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken by an aci@@ di @-@ Arab News side , which claimed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an had said that mon@@ ks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Kongo to capture this information .
the original entry , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news agencies , the AF@@ P as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ ein his statement , but did not move the image from the DRC in connection .
the worldwide spectrum of false information
tracks of this false com@@ missions are enough to go back into the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be seen how far more information can exceed limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture @-@ search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to that of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mask on private sides , social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , other attempts to escape the f@@ ake .
we have used examples of the impro@@ per use and associated with the respective countries on the basis of what page it has been published . as a result , we want to show the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples from the listed countries ( which are linked together in some cases ) can be used for ab@@ usive use .
here some cases that can still be split up now ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News frames .
example of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange levels may refer to pages or server , about the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably for@@ g@@ ging examples .
in memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blog@@ ger from Quebec City do not only refer to the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions on the inten@@ tions of the persons and the scattered trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria it burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i , Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ublic@@ a , the district is identified as the christ@@ ian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ub@@ b@@ lica quotes his source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( which is not known if the original report has the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ amounts according to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this , which used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam . &quot; they have seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which contra@@ di@@ ct this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the def@@ ective use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US American , antique commentary in Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues to keep peace in Myanmar in Myanmar .

this page used the picture as a cover to put Muslims n@@ ig@@ eri@@ an@@ ic Christians .
this alleg@@ ation was denied by a Greek fact check @-@ site in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims over the news Agency Nas@@ in and used to illustr@@ ate the picture of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the DR Kongo was a test@@ ament to the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion for@@ ums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usive use of the images from the DR Kongo on one hand side , the sympath@@ y opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a Blo@@ g@@ gers , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya was persecuted , since the photos were im@@ properly used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a correc@@ t@@ ance of what they were able as &quot; inten@@ tionally fing@@ ering news and photographs that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to make mis@@ understanding of the Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ t@@ ance that appeared exclusively on English also includes references to f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ors that will operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and elsewhere ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x congregation , demonstrates that the picture of the DR Kongo does NOT show Muslims who Christians kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page alleged that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein has been cleared in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the time of this publication is still included in the image .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic close @-@ related news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image is not taken by the red@@ ness , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ Shi@@ ite attack . &quot;
as the picture later related to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to rev@@ ise that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the DR Kongo on the same day , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion in Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and on Tuesday to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took place in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image has been interpreted as a cover to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were connected with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( German ) , 2014 .
after a message that had allegedly been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acres , was put into circulation , and put it here on Vietnamese and explained it to Fal@@ se .
from the Embassy in which the picture of the DR Kongo was , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also shows , but are no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan , and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amp / date st@@ amping exist on the web cra@@ wler and ver@@ ts they feature a picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may ultimately under@@ go a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) to go through these Post@@ s . the first frame focuses on Religion .
the photo was used in regards to major discussions about silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming has been used to discuss how an African life is evaluated by comparison to a European or French life .
they understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can &apos;t give these images anymore .
with social media , there are eigh@@ ty people who have un@@ inten@@ tional that water round about a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this mood of mal@@ icious and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that the actual atro@@ cities did not true and decor@@ ates the real grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the prevalence of for@@ ci@@ ble pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even required by the victims .
at the same time , the concern is that the for@@ ci@@ ble pictures have readers and spectators and to give them the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as those trial , that seem to effect as for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
during a lot to discuss represent@@ ations in the news media , fact , fact that it is indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they are thoroughly based on the situation in which a picture can be applied completely from the context or completely ab@@ usive species .
however , any investigation may be considered to be considered internationally as international .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( i.e. un@@ acceptable ) ende@@ av@@ ors to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in each language : they are certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ acceptable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish braking ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ ned at any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
this unique words have been collected in an online list for all time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u language :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h for your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years .

in Bir@@ ds &apos;s words from his blog about :
they grin@@ d other cultures , un@@ veil other thought and wake up our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; words and show them differently , valuable and impressive these small languages .

like Sri Lanka with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ ine cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island nation Sri Lanka has now seen the worst flood disaster and cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by the sun sun , which normally runs at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ co ag@@ alu O@@ ya came into 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
following an opinion from Sri Lanka &apos;s opinion from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and hundreds of people are killed because of the floods and battles .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe locations .
the rainfall left on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water area in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene agencies of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water@@ ways of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ es and Sri Lanka are regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .

the Women &apos;s March 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
using appro@@ x@@ .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part on the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bors and love @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust her my four year old daughter , she trusted her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call par@@ ols for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ inc@@ ur we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head cloth high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ an@@ gled slo@@ gan@@ ols against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you ? &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? , &quot; I wonder .
I have already led this entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who know me since years - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built in their performance .
they mus@@ cl@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims who don &apos;t fit there to be muscles there .
being dis@@ mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t get that alone .
that is even the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are coming in a sense when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad was up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion was deleted by Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion represents a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the induc@@ tive images of Muslims , which already colon@@ ise Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man that should fear and the exotic woman whom you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian American scientist Edward S@@ aid took home the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but this images came up again today .
our politicians , the news industry , and Hollywood they continued to keep it .
I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative our news@@ fe@@ eds domin@@ ate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ es the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries during the United States during the US in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fail to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to take on her head cloth in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabia in public buildings to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group pract@@ ises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ vely weak@@ ens Muslim women who perform movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers , that were brought to slave ships with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has realized our collective pre @-@ creation force of art and def@@ ective , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are often used for anti@@ static attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations .
because of these stories , we tell us and because of the nature , in which we tell it , is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we are also creating Nar@@ rative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and we are failed to raise the seven million Muslims who make up the highest degree &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ins@@ ulated Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author was born in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first piece design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by the Muslim , American poles of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were innocent of Muslims and Americans .
but now I am ir@@ cl@@ ed mus@@ li@@ a and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t ask a por@@ k eat , I tell - instead of my Muslim Recipes or my hand@@ ful pocket transmitter that all Muslims wear - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m j@@ oking , we wear not all pocket calcul@@ ates with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and religious activists , who ende@@ av@@ our to fight far lies about Islam .
these lies are produced in the current band of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ eig@@ al machinery of fine , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories , we tell us and because of the nature , in which we tell it , there is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia with more than just a stranger that prov@@ oked the head cloth .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole U.S. , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms g@@ lows our affili@@ ation .
it ri@@ p@@ ens our identity which is so far below , so versatile and versatile that it can fit in a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born when Mus@@ lim@@ a was born when I was a Muslim force , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when soci@@ ologist religious life describe themselves , they attack the following phr@@ ases : believ@@ ing , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not visible but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neigh@@ bors , my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when it might look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that can separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ po@@ end@@ al rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept it in my arms and to protect the Arab verses to protect against the protection of the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every of them I repeat three times .
I pray you , that it is being protected from evil , evil that can see and see the evil man that can &apos;t see .
my Muslim faith is probably not visible but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometimes pos@@ ing in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the painting of my grand@@ mother &apos;s matern@@ al dam with her sisters , as they win a contest of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi prior to decades .
it &apos;s the picture of her that I slept in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of the old Su@@ fi Savi@@ or ; and an Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with an hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be virtually exter@@ n@@ ally .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers that she said to me , if I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be there , as they taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only lord .
for a people who was founded over centuries - through a &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; colony , which has founded a company with the name of the British Eastern in@@ ium @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep significance to name God , my only Lord .
the author was founded in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but also to see that my dar@@ ed grandfather wine is weeping .
in the middle , during his books on modern Islam and beyond the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept sore v@@ ehem@@ ently for his family in India ruled the family that he was not allowed to close its arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were taken apart from my grandfather , the Muslim world like at the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the past two centuries of Europeans everyone could have colon@@ ised by up to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , cro@@ codi@@ fied subject of British Empire , called the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; when he led the first mosque in England .
even before the aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back to our unforgettable nest ; our un@@ plug@@ ged story .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful army of the world , with troops , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , were spread throughout Iraq to pursue mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is bur@@ ried among the ruins of the war .
an American mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mur@@ der@@ ate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is native to the USA , the susp@@ ects bears a Muslim name , history four times more is reported than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called the Az@@ aan , called Bil@@ al , freed from a liberated black slaves .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ v@@ av@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name a American hero .
it is the warmth , which I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams , and when we say black life .
one American female , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a nut@@ ty and a journalist , the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of ours with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate them on other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion represents more possibilities than a magical cube , but is represented in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , me to ensure my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that a powerful and privileged individuals built on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is affected by President Bush and President Obama , with President Bush .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immig@@ rant , who occupies a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists of a country that closes its borders against people from just over the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes mostly Arab@@ s and Muslims .
there are the wars which we conduct and throw bombs in Muslim countries .
because of the stories , we tell us and because of those who we do not tell us , are we today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University are a scientifically documented picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation , which we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to represent the Muslim and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous formation , which we store in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement , headed by American Muslims within the media industry that seeks to capture our multiply , ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ al video series Secret Li@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multiply Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the pak@@ ist@@ ics , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ ating that want to show complexity and complexity of Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global point , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences to go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason to con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ist that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by making the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years before , there had not been given them ; now they rule over large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am wor@@ ried about the re@@ alities and the history , I &apos;m not aware of myself when I was so old as my daughter is , but who made me today about an unknown Muslim Bel@@ lim@@ a .
things I have left here as a bread @-@ track in my speech .
things perhaps for@@ ging the memories , for in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions which our humanity makes out , may indicate a story where someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations will take place at the 8th Annual Meeting of the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms , with which we are usually looking for our school@@ ing , or who we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves , why ?
why I tell you this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are guided and people through the title of &quot; others &quot; in public screening , four decades even Scientific assistant was Stan@@ ford .
we have to introduce ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of this , deliber@@ ately and in@@ aware of the &quot; other , &quot; as it is my gir@@ l@@ friend and I like to give us a new future , where we did not have president , the chocolate cake , while he already en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and to another &quot; people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rated art wants to preserve urban voice diversity

can there be a way , here and now , despite a language barrier with som@@ eb@@ ody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the &quot; Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the stories of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported a brief initiative by Steven Bird , the incredible blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but in the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and to dig@@ nity .
actually , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept@@ ing di@@ vers@@ ität - safe spaces that are not forgotten in those inhabitants are to be attributed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to appreciate that link . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format a stor@@ yt@@ eller will initially set their history first in their own language and translate or declare them in English .
even if the participants are no professional master &apos;s count , their commitment and their representation is that the au@@ dien@@ ces can be en@@ shr@@ ined on it .
they call for laugh@@ ing and emotions , than the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , history collection of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cont@@ est@@ ates also the opportunity to clari@@ fy the country &apos;s typical customs of exploration .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of the bun@@ ny and the avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explains the meaning of his f@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience , that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he divi@@ des his feeling of the vision :
they have heard it !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and organis@@ ers are hop@@ ing to expand this . all those who have inspired by the project can organize a T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS .
Puerto Rico requ@@ est@@ ing from the U.S. re @-@ en@@ forcement of the State School
with the aim of a new inspection of Puerto Rico , which took part in 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march of march in the pu@@ ert@@ orial Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da , &quot; ( Citi@@ zens for the ne@@ ural testing of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the debt of debts also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your requirement :
the nation of Puerto R@@ os calls for that the politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for the debts of their corruption .
we require a financial assessment and a line committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our work conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be dis@@ counted with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the State of State for an integrated territory of the United States - suffered under a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization of party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state views .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures taken to be taken out without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizens are taken in danger to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian National developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing a year since more than a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , he continued his supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture that is held in Berlin , devoted itself to a event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of France &apos;s resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , director of book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; completed books within three to five days , l@@ ases from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ voice ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective re@@ research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is licensed under license , contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a tribute to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to show how movements for fre@@ es know and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
activ@@ ist , artist , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in movements for fre@@ es knowledge , have worked on page to page about the ne@@ bul@@ ae which find our news@@ fe@@ eds and create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the loved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was yesterday &apos;s name of the A@@ dra prison , where he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have since then requested no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title colleague Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce his friends and his family , who want to access his release , and who want to know him back in his ordinary lives and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in free culture , has many of us to start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , works and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given in this process of time extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer of open source and digital activ@@ ist has been published by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ jail , a non @-@ military installation , transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who had promoted themselves as an in@@ sider of the Assad government and made them an alleged death against her husband .
his dwelling place and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer in the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , played a crucial role in the Internet , providing access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently super@@ se@@ ded the director of the New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was no one of Bass@@ ano &apos;s cultural prototypes as the work which he started with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civilians and mer@@ ging gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architectural models with hi@@ es@@ spl@@ ant traditions and Persian influences .
the Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS had everything to put everything that architecture does not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ans but the world .
this shift in the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be given to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable .
the project has not yet been able to shut up this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of liberty and teaching me to emb@@ race her .
I have overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English to me , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has his knowledge of each shared who asked him . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought other in@@ mates how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically without that they actually stopped one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a Pro@@ mis@@ sal , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was living in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together with the book a year .
they g@@ ing@@ ed the lyrics , when they visited him , and translated them out of the Arab in English .
the book is licensed .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it is happening in every visit ,
that I will sing in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the d@@ angers has no matter ,
any of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and gu@@ ards
I forget the prison of the prison
and me in every detail of your voice and words
which I carry on my passion for me ,
if your eyes tell Le@@ be@@ es
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return soon to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and to smile , and to smile .
I testify to myself that I will be back soon ...

since the beginning of the protests against the Regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ets , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( sy@@ ris@@ king network for human rights ) have disappeared for more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under separation of the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians died in prison according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many others are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been on the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat today our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .

Mos@@ ambi@@ ana responded with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , at which the corruption was committed .

Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good guide and immediately called his re @-@ setting into the company what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evalu@@ ates the application , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , again , as the company passed away no discipline to its imprisonment .
but many people don &apos;t want the action good .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which sets itself for public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company , to address the director again :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a return in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what knowledge is to know , that the company should also have a discipl@@ ining process against the ir@@ resist@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company was silent , however , no adequate legal steps for the application of relevant functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also starting and considered the case as &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would have been a competent type , he would be consultants when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which he had to eat .
he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , it is illi@@ c@@ ited to re@@ integrate into the company that he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is glad@@ ly paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ que and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil says , the director no mur@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he did not believe him , I can &apos;t believe anyone who had so massi@@ vely mature in such a way .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already been serving a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead himself served by the State .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was using the state , when it has been used to get an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of this man that was up@@ loaded and finally sentenced to long term imprisonment .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this guy was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to recall the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el to recall that a thief has heard in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el the Moz@@ ambi@@ que is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , sl@@ itting and - right by - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of its most famous oral represent@@ ations , when it was energet@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of being able to sell his own individual interest , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said likewise , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but it does not turn from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is a criminal criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today it sets him the company , at which he re@@ tre@@ ason , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ass@@ ets Him . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means c@@ chick@@ peas or aging lens .

according to information by Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Networks took their postal from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discuss@@ ing the source of the word , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian source or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; In@@ sight . &quot;
Facebook is cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; ( in bur@@ ial Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hass@@ usion in Burma in the social network .
over the past few years , the rise of radical National movements of the word has given an extreme poverty reduction .
in particular , it is a word that mostly of ultra @-@ national@@ ists are used as hate crimes against Muslims who represent a minority in Myanmar .
but in the efforts to fight them in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sen@@ su@@ al contents on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word at itself calls not automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they also discussed the use of the word or in doubt for the purpose of his use , cen@@ sored .
Moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic differences , which have the same accounting pattern like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ aging b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cra@@ ck A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however he asked his friends in spiritu@@ ally , whether they could wake up his back pain as he made a voc@@ abul@@ ary .
the sentence K@@ u la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( K@@ u ) + the Quest@@ ion@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ s is the opinion that they will decrease in Hass@@ ce radical national@@ ists , but also stressed that Facebook could be analytical , before it sol@@ der all the Post@@ s to spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the automation is not understood what you are to do on them .
what it should do instead , check the post carefully and check it by reading the next words .
for example , Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( aged b@@ old ) .
the good is that these three national@@ ist national@@ ists w@@ anders them to spread a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its national@@ ism .
while the action may send a powerful signal to all them , hate , even the efficiency of this strategy may not stick long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat showed that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of drums are often associated with a cat and mouse game where users can simply start social networks , a new word or an alternative writing of the zen@@ ry word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , like Facebook started to delete his friends when he wanted to make his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
Iron@@ ically my post of Facebook was removed from Facebook and given me the li@@ ken , post and share of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards are not un@@ explained . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards away , which have no negative inten@@ tions or just try to show their opinions against them speaking radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with them :
post without Hass@@ le from Facebook .
in the Post , the author divided his opinion about how extreme national@@ ism and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism are po@@ or@@ ly damaged in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more than would do more Facebook before the beginning of the initiative , for example :
Facebook wants a well @-@ looking int@@ ent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
a lot of words to zen@@ eg@@ s will be made even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems that if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Patri@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; have been banned .
even when they found out that they had done mistake , they didn &apos;t tried to put them correctly .
if it has only been a bit more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would have a major sales that would be great .
fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided for a lot of spi@@ racy among users .
instead of serious , users are now funny as Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posters are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s that had no hate speech , but still have been removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch a heat curr@@ y and watch a Indian movie .
only to try if Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and its influence .
in other things , the tongue in social networks should also heat the violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where the Muslims between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced to flee to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his convic@@ tion , they critic@@ ised themselves on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than simply wants to zen@@ ry the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better in context than concentr@@ ating on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end of the child
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to impos@@ e a law which puts its practice , so that the married age is now 18 .
prior to this change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es , some members kept Hin@@ ist@@ ical and Muslim religious communities in the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country assembled , that the state should not freeze , since it was not to determin@@ ate the maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ ob@@ taining the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has been a contractual partner to the United Nations Child Convention on Human Rights , which is defined for people under 18 years of age .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statist@@ ical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , who ende@@ av@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws to pedi@@ atri@@ e , followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went perfectly .
one Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for instance , had no concerns to say the criticism of the children &apos;s before , they should be condemned to worry about their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition looked for tension in this virtually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime wor@@ ried doubt whether the opposition would be in the bill at all .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children to@@ e was decided - despite 4 trans@@ formers ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country must vote and declare the law .
one of the trans@@ formers of the country gave a Status update which has again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft plan can now be made to the law .
the majority of the social media users have been impressed because the laws have been changed to children &apos;s before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has a lot of time and un@@ necessary Ger@@ ede , which has devoured the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every price .
while Abel was my opinion it was definitely enough to finish his practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ escape all @-@ Thomas was delighted that the day finally arrived :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excellent News !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ding Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil group that talked quite openly about how important the passage of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amendment to the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es Act was today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were opposed to law have approved for the law .
the child before is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ bearing child@@ judge .
many thanks to all activists who have laid it out .
congratulations to your cart .
a Th@@ ank to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
prior to months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj declared his intention to join the judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of Law , said it was absolutely legitim@@ ately when Mah@@ ar@@ aj was going to act against the law , the most social media users w@@ ished , one would take the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l struck :
Dear Sat , if we can say , instead of the debate in general , in a way that we invite , to say the state into our bedroom , simply target to say the state into our bedroom , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ backed males who may be ab@@ used against them in the advantage , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but if it is a judicial proceedings against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are legally legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they teach them .

on Sunday the office of the prosec@@ utor in the local News Service Y@@ ar@@ news announced that they were min@@ ced .
through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English language page was reported on 18 January 2012 , against the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Cop@@ y@@ rights legislation in the USA , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over one month now , Turkey closed the popular and popular enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day for Tag it is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information .
both students and fans of TV series watches against the blocking .
although many technicians of Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( an current article published by the New York Times ) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world , the most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been shut up in 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society has been adopted at Harvard University , you will find regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most important country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages , mir@@ ro@@ red the contents of Wikipedia and frequently ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform dispos@@ ed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( which hosts machine computers ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a Blo@@ g@@ post report IP@@ FS on his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used it all to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed others .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was independently conducted by the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only concerns screen@@ shots and a live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i von Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy , has both tr@@ am@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kno@@ ck , a Mir@@ ror from Wikipedia , as well as the Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use with similar mir@@ ror@@ sides , when used in the respective country Wikipedia , is brought forth .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member and collabor@@ ator with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open peaks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you can get to another URL which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey .
because it is run by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese Wild@@ animal photographer uses his camera to atten@@ tive attention to the need for nature conservation

S@@ in Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around itself , never satisfied . they were missing with bad@@ ly positi@@ onable moti@@ ves and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him to carry a camera and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ar was trying to bring Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife on the international stage .
and his home @-@ home right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , giving him the perfect opportunity to shoot a photos that direct the attention of Nep@@ als fa@@ una .
he described this on Facebook , how this superb location in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just arrived at home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father to be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed it and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to get pictures to Kni@@ p@@ sen ! !
S@@ LC is aiming to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to understand the understanding of understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look .
and he should know it , because he stood already with his face to face ,
a tiger can &apos;t be dis@@ rup@@ ted from the opinion of sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
even because of darkness on the way to the house , when suddenly the king of the b@@ he@@ k appeared , he is immediately going , we look forward , and star@@ red me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ins placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take pictures in Bar@@ dia National Park shots of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the Tourist Office .
see below some of these photos .

a few years after the wedding , Indian women fought for the first time to submit their hus@@ bands .

this post has been written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published by Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family .
instead , use a p@@ onom@@ en or tell &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ art@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the standard to preserve this practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ ost@@ a by a head@@ court and spur@@ red by her family and the village community , after being addressed a rel@@ ying relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives also not names to name , is also common among men . however , they are far from less assign@@ ments to fear if they don &apos;t know this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health care as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main spec@@ kl@@ ed topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the host@@ esses of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
when one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ help Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is set up for degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ c has been working with the help of her vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s homes up to the ban of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected people , and conduc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports about how this clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini shown in their discussion , tra@@ ded women who didn &apos;t call their hus@@ bands during the name .
she decided to decide on this subject , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
the names of their hus@@ bands would not be im@@ it@@ uted according to their hus@@ bands , it is also a custom in which they have been found in comm@@ it@@ ments and never put into question .
Roh@@ ini comments :
this tradition testify that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t holding this , is considered a list , considered a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made our discussions on this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to test her husband , so far at the name of the name , tried to try out at home just as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion lap of her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband were still long after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me and said that I should name it from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion in their luggage with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor never before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , the women tried to bringing the discussion with practice in gear .
Roh@@ ini bat each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ end , sad , loving and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us as they want , means that they must not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ ra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never had to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise just before themselves sick ; a second decided to leave the whole fru@@ stration against him and leave his family by destro@@ ying him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even at the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ st about that , with an ancient br@@ oth , the women decided that they would actually try to call her hus@@ bands during the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini got a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head : his wife could not stop his name to say .
another cl@@ ub@@ er decided to do it when dinner before the entire family .
when her mother in mother murdered them , she was afraid , and said that it was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
raw ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the car@@ cin@@ oma size of the cin@@ oma size at the fore@@ head , which shows the comm@@ ent@@ status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry out the g@@ no@@ red dot if he had it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to bear him .
the other women have not completely dis@@ counted , but mine , they are now in a better position , even to choose it on some days .
for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip in every discussion club .
normally we packed lun@@ ches and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that the women might make what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never made thoughts before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have worked on some things , for example , as our identity are tied to our hus@@ bands , never f@@ rank so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say certain things say no@@ isy , no matter how small she happened .
in a discussion round we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group had been married to Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay but some wanted to bear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a far shirt above a tro@@ users ; they did not tar@@ red .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own h@@ anger , the mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , D@@ ug@@ g@@ inger her own pairs of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round that the women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to make it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion has been changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly get into rollers :
so far we have done just small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then heard again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it still , but only when they are alone and there are not any other family members .
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women at the discussion group know that they would like to reach them in their lives - like the arrow to access more freedom of movement or the own coat h@@ ers - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving of each other self @-@ confidence , them will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw is explained :
each of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club is each of us the confidence that it will change something .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman is in the club home , and other people are reported about what we &apos;re talking and what we do .
we are all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ@@ ism , probably for super@@ vis@@ ing purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations into life to practice the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the District of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border of Malawi .
one of the sacrifices were found and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently stressed that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there may be the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a fine man &apos;s gold be@@ aded or riches , the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia on the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on a member of two men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the goal of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to ensure that the UN launched a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government of campaigns developed to combat this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ ten@@ ant parts .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he war@@ ned those who have to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel according to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are goal of rit@@ ual attacks in Moz@@ ambi@@ que , war@@ ned the Mos@@ ambi@@ que Police to the latest reading of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the District of Mil@@ ange , where they took place .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , Student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ let urban in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already left the case :
PR@@ M believes that the anas are wound in the death of a strong men &apos;s death .
the persecution and killing of glorious individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ov@@ l@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ ew@@ rit@@ u@@ als , has given cultural moti@@ fs and is given by the traditional Sh@@ aman in worship ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to the victims in the head , the rich@@ ness of wealth .
in the last days three men were murdered with hair@@ less problems in this part of the country .
in Facebook , Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha , issued by the chron@@ icle of the bloody arms of Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , said that the problem is part of greater social difficulty , Moz@@ ambi@@ que is facing the Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
I like to wish E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ICH is a country where the people would have to go to the street , having sex against good notes , and who would not viol@@ ate their life to get their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ s or un@@ question@@ ed or &quot; black magic &quot; are ch@@ ased out which aim to get rid of their real wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community attention , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State of State ) after he calls on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker nar@@ row@@ ly telling it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , China continues to be able to release from the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , who allow him to search for a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others have been completely ex@@ iled .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker has refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u in foreign countries .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer any questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway , when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government has over@@ loaded that this was ultimately not to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to record the salmon trips to China , since exports had mostly been blocked since 2010 .
after the message had spread that Li@@ u had seriously wounded , the Nobel Peace Committee gave his hope to un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to meet his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife to get rid of the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading Diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for release Li@@ us , as she over@@ took her in an explanation on 30 June :
we are waiting at the same time that China elev@@ ates all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members .
they must meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and able to communicate free with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad reminds us that the Americans asked him that he had the possibility of getting abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar by his satisfaction . &quot;
an speaking speaker of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on June 27th that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities refused to release not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the decision of US Embassy in China had a waste response from China to himself , with the appearance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to have become of unique and responsi@@ bly remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as the international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Herr@@ mann and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a resolution in Congress to allow the Chinese government to access it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally disabled .

Li@@ us attor@@ ney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact us .

all necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he needs , regardless where , his wife and his family can contact him .
even though the news portal France Info already reported that the French government would be called Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , there was no further information that France will eventually record him .

Singapore : city or Land ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be stup@@ id as Singapore is recognized by the international level as an independent state .
however , according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be regarded as a town in Singapore .
this statement has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister informed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , in order to compare Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ score that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has changed in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , with most people go an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and offerings , this valuable land is to create , you can say that we finally be no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the shine of a escape before the responsibilities , a compulsory infr@@ ing@@ ement .
Singapore , if thou art not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel ers : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; ordinary countries &apos; , in view of whose , he was in@@ sof@@ tened .
however , in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore has to be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which become permanent by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old gl@@ ers from the authorized rulers take up the democ@@ rats introduced to be better , because it fits better to their power .
in the final week the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his US guests regarding our press , our joy@@ ful , our political system really not answers .
relevant questions could be rati@@ cally rati@@ onal with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our wer@@ ed K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the trouble to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing on his commentary on his comment , referring to the reviews you should begin to read the entire address of the conference so that you could understand the context of the declaration of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore gets so un@@ parall@@ eled , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lik@@ ened to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of those cities saw the party a party of decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not show it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment via Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , which makes it as leader one of the growing generation , such as pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what said the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which expected me to agree with them , or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I am not even sure whether he really believes , and is aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review s@@ ush@@ es the weak spots of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ uments :
has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; did an error , or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher person ?
if Singapore is no country , we are considered an independent and sover@@ eign state ?
if not , what country is the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious significance .
why do the people work their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
finally , the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the year , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set appears to be more popular than that of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak for the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ erable aspect regarding your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as a part of a continuing array , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et will be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is preferred to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation that takes place in the discussion , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner by providing personal issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication then follow the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are a lot of Canadian , if they are kept for Americans , but not bo@@ ther@@ ed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for som@@ eb@@ ody who doesn &apos;t know it is little bit different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian player buys a Canadian flag clearly visible on her back@@ pack , when they travel .
all love Canadian .
by contrast , Americans are ... .
it was even when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Kan@@ adi@@ ans have always borne small ap@@ hor@@ als in their baggage to distinguish themselves from her American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
the same sex marri@@ ages are legally established in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we are obviously very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supp@@ os@@ edly regarded as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends I ad@@ mi@@ red a lot .
nothing would make me nothing if one would switch to Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there is also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; cute &quot; is to be referred to as &quot; cute , &quot; says to be a di@@ ligent to be as the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian doubles ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; does not have a personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , is in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and very interesting to make no attention .
this can be something good when you stay un@@ noticed in the background , from the things you pass around one .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire is free and alone to be a principal member of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what ri@@ verb@@ ose than &quot; nice &quot; can be lab@@ elled , is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian people don &apos;t talk about the fence away with the neigh@@ bors .
us l@@ acks the warm warm , open kindness , which I have connected with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian is more than just &quot; cute . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost too sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand ( Jun@@ ta )
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band released a music video that took power in 2014 and restore the j@@ unta in 2014 and restore civilian rule despite their promises .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour is a young man who tells you what rules are his friend .
although not explicitly polit@@ ically , the music video refers directly to the continued military su@@ prem@@ acy of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , this was shared on Facebook with 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The dict@@ ator has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists open the public to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to Thai politics , in particular , how to keep it with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at this video recordings that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand continued in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; might possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which the upper @-@ command@@ ing of the army &apos;s absolute decision grants an important national topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer crime against , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often explo@@ ited by the authorities to rem@@ n@@ ate activ@@ ist and other revie@@ wers of the State .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the Army , monitors the online content and persons who were accused of having assassin@@ ated the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Trip ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later there was a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta has pursued , is their decision to buy U @-@ boats , although security instructor they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax defects is required .
in the video , it will even be shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before they bring it into an intern@@ ment camp another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and for Internet users , they should sm@@ ite the monarchy for long purposes .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band who was using Sal@@ ut out &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; had already been used by coup opponent during the protests in 2014 .

the post@@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ is@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ c@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years now , since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ c@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon pool of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , fir@@ ing , Geor@@ g@@ iers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called spiritual cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ters .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ c@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after it had barely increased over one decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; that &apos;s a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , symbo@@ lically stands for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are fallen and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls to him hard to end this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , served all of the community .
now there are only paved road with b@@ lown spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
people who once lived in this location and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile left the district .
in the town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like it .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that can accommodate one or two families , recogni@@ zes at the balconies where clothes is being dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed house .
when you discover me with the camera in the hand , they draw back immediately .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just forbidden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed somewhat in her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leaves her destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people are working in the area for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise company called T@@ c@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of lands@@ cap@@ tive products for your own demand ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables .
it is difficult to come over the laps .
the District Court provides free of candles and bread for the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to the jung@@ le ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left her to live with her . &quot; my heart will always stay in cash for ever . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial help by her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ chil@@ ds instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a house nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ alya told that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and public holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this - everybody is busy with its own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls her to her . &quot; they said , We could build zu@@ cchini .
I have prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remin@@ is@@ cent of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives found in Central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia , and Georgia ( the country &apos;s country @-@ Asia left ) , they had not had the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration building in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a little while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives a $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s Kinder@@ garten was once kept , they kept pigs , cows , H@@ aly@@ ne and chick@@ ens .
it tells us that it was initially a very fear@@ ful situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time , they lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark road or the few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has rather to do with pill@@ age .
after the war , there were hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember to remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our conversation ten@@ ded to the end , a little boy is over to us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , then rolls down the hill .
one group children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them cast a stone on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which provide for non@@ sense in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses the migrants on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is leading a small hotel in tap@@ est@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of mig@@ raine , which cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ dial diamond frame and golden ear@@ ring in t@@ ed@@ dy b@@ ären .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal of Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for approximately 2,50 Dollar / night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , br@@ ushed walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migran@@ t come here .
sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez , tells the people in full small bus@@ hes and from the top part of the coast to call them : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but in this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she desires to refuse .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when she is sick , they buys their medicines that they can not pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m one of the long journey exhau@@ sti@@ ve strings .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable top name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , which has a joystick # ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered them with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels to Boston for his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are in the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then moving towards the north .
the family had heard of other sign@@ posts of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti .
it tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans are talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his position , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building staff for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; says he sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests will send her often text@@ books when they are gone to gre@@ et them or to report on their journey over the course of their journey .
they explain that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well known here but it is not the only funk@@ y hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l @-@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valencia and his family have entered into their small house .
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ er@@ ets have been sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on ceilings in the ground but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells me . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before men who wanted to make money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a Un@@ known , a single attraction , has offered her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and trying to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the corners they consult their teleph@@ ones quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but it also nost@@ alg@@ ically , because of those who go away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she bl@@ ended in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ dr@@ yers which has made a customer , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers , young and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while they briefly presented me .
&quot; Ya se Crit@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices to X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , that ...
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic min@@ orities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the cell@@ phone user in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification where it indicates the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification it is said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the authorities can use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture were arrested because they had been installed shortly after they had exchanged the app . News with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terror@@ ists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books , and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ast website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing @-@ Pages to make users to make sure how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network .
this App with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in a variety of course .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ing could trigger the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China is mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the East and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , ethnic minority interests like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet alter@@ ations .
the media @-@ out@@ let @-@ out@@ let &quot; images from the China &quot; ( showing that of this happening ) , the zen@@ si@@ erte news in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen visited the occup@@ ants if they had installed monitoring app .
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of the captivity through the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the Republic of China &quot; ( the same thing ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software is able to raise the password needs of a Windows operating system to receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones are located in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang might possibly create a reaction to the statements of the city council , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities , and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions for the Cyber@@ security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American Convention on Human Rights , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities released the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell@@ phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards in the local police .
the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; ; however , this promotion viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other things , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after Death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ on@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in a series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian jail .
far away from our blue , virtual world you &apos;ll see you and setting that you are completely alone in one place where everything is important .
everything was dissolved after and after dis@@ solves and a truth exposed to clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has to be found in a list of feelings and pressures , which allow no Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality bring you back , and you linger behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the actors - are the characters of the beings from flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es after death .
all the Zweifel lo@@ osen up in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of affliction , you will know that you have been imprisoned here between the walls , who have built your parents here , and before them your grand@@ parents , a stone by stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough to have &quot; my lesson &quot; as the chief of the security service de@@ formulated - with that promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he introduced his power over us , having even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn during a peaceful protests like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient to destroy the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all urban area cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , ra@@ iny , at the wrong time , even when I set no high demands to a city that is to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had cal@@ ming down slightly after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke the silence , by playing several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof cried .
I heard my voice ir@@ cl@@ ed through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt good enough to assemble .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends included me ; we took us a magnificent picture that my expectations fully and fully filled .
in such a moment it will be aware of you that you liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the Ger@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; making you ready , we meet at the military security office . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can bring down - nothing can withdraw your voice from you all the way until the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear , as you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only to cry out enough to cry when we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ ump@@ ed eyes opened on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really g@@ rief to look at me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
maybe it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity . perhaps at the Revolution .
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such disast@@ rous consequences for me , and I regre@@ t no word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father equal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this pro@@ flu@@ ent movement is to me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an alleged torture which I had been suspended for months .
I go through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I pre@@ ge all details to me before I serve the room .
otherwise , otherwise it was allocated to me a larger cell .
I have to share them with only one single prisoners and may put me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I took back to an old @-@ established communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell count was a &quot; Aw@@ ak@@ ening &quot; .
after long to@@ ast , he finally answered me .
apparently there was none of the surrounding cells a respected man middle age who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no striking fac@@ tions can be seen , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe som@@ eb@@ ody , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers linked its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me , they would stay free when I tar@@ ry .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to distribute all these hor@@ semen , which at the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at least 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at that time , the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I always was convinced that black is the color of the ver@@ b@@ bin until I saw the yellow light , that presented us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; playing on 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; you are here to listen to . &quot;
this was the secret to protect the sover@@ eign state of the state and to prevent the sover@@ eig@@ ns and the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they did their conf@@ essional comp@@ ress@@ ors and inher@@ ited the close view of their world view .
that is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call tax @-@ exist@@ ent to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I cared for the hearing space and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions that start to him , &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much wi@@ ch@@ ti@@ ger@@ es with your life when you join the day@@ time and protest at demonstrations , which soon will find an end . &quot;
I don &apos;t answered .
I was acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer me , not to answer .
I can &apos;t even say anything to say when insul@@ ators and mud will become a friendly interview for me in ordinary communication .
when and what happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to acc@@ ust@@ ed me if I had to be punished , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
to sentence in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me so much flesh as possible by the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ ths .
your Hen@@ ker puts it at your cry .
give it pleasure to him , you can not measure you with him , and you cannot stop your cri@@ es .
my cry were not enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage collector , or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had four cables in one another , in order to present the great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour , three of them are changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice , why I ceased to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling and took no delight in it , so it was the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through the whole body , enough to supply my whole area .
my semi @-@ bare body , which lay out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the di@@ vor@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two horri@@ ble hours he decided that he had met his duty for the night .
that must have been so around midnight .
I decided to lay down my sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed away that came to me like minutes ago .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door open itself and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering with the voice of one exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must become fear@@ ful wor@@ ried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and go you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoking a cig@@ ar in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; once he shu@@ ff@@ led to his screen , sometimes on his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on , there is a cig@@ ar between his fingers or his companions to be discovered with nic@@ ot@@ ine mol@@ dy lips .
he lives in the top level of his family house which had been one of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist that the conservative majority has turned over against gender , sexual activity and free expression of opinion through art and rap@@ ist .
with his music that deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the whole Arab world . all these issues are not only allowed in his home town of Am@@ man relev@@ ance , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria until the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking , and he can feel with their own statement regarding the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it is not open , he over@@ threw against the US foreign policy , a special ascent .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Po@@ ems of the second generation , &quot; he himself describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then add it : &quot; I think it was , because I am a man , while in the water sol@@ uble Nes@@ café in two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that period it is intended for Muslims who fast@@ en from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain bro@@ ok@@ s to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ atively called Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
they generally speak a warm coffee and the wa@@ ist@@ ing of K@@ ent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan was like a prison under the free sky , above all when taking a look into the neighbouring countries .
thus , it avo@@ ids that it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to avoid not in prison .
recently , the interior of the Jord@@ anian country has canc@@ eled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians that support the Islamic Ac@@ ross front - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ dic@@ ated to the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ person of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b told in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers .
many asser@@ ts that the band &apos;s commitment to matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that provides the old proven legitim@@ acy &apos;s regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rated the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of Human Rights , &quot; which continued to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be s@@ enriched rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a distinct evident reality reflected in Jordan , which appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ signed a traditional gender perspective by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women that have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ y sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman , whose arms and legs desc@@ ends up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them that they should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ atorium &apos; - the un@@ official exterior .
human Rights Watch report@@ edly reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , it is added that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support women , the victims of murder or domestic violence to support appropriate type .
according to a law , in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ famili@@ al violence , &quot; to un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for its release is often a long @-@ bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen .
even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is very popular with great popularity and it is known to rever@@ t well ahead of topics covered in his country as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b cont@@ ests that his work is polit@@ ically , however , he recogni@@ zes his music that is full of exp@@ on@@ ite attacks on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , husband .
my policy has been decided to me , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question according to the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs written in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and every other &apos;s it too . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - is faith or non @-@ belief , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ e@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that no one speaks in Jordan over the rights of vibr@@ ations and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were even cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview on the popular German On@@ line@@ an@@ ic On@@ line@@ age programme , in order to realize that his comments were torn out of the context , and in his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance opposed to homosexu@@ als did not talk to Islam .
it men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks , if Abu Nu@@ vo , who should work later on behalf of the potassium , in the eighth century could be open to homosexu@@ ality , why does Jord@@ anian aren &apos;t able to do this ?
the real problem such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled due to do .
in the H@@ asch@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is no new thing that the government attacks against the free expression of opinion and that progressive voices can be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an News Service adopted several former government agencies and members of the teaching area , with the grounds , they had expressed themselves on comments in social media , which led to the deep in the country .
in view of whose , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ anian .
for him is progress a permanent call . M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a is now a concert for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is made of slow , deliber@@ ate and in@@ significant changes . it is certain that these changes take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , dre@@ am@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ aming not only of them to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience her . &quot;
perhaps the region will assume the help of music , art and literature of a real and basic off@@ ence - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ itions and artificial art conducted democ@@ ra@@ cies . at least , he hopes it .
even so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will res@@ or@@ ded and thus also resist resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which is part of the Student Fel@@ low as Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war pro@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . a further theory states that the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been delivered and from a period of time , in the army &apos;s native to the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , which em@@ it to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could gra@@ b us a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can just imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( Sum@@ t@@ l .
I have a look at Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for long time : two fixed cars are currently visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will take the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the Country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high brake car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they help to keep Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the Fr@@ iz@@ urs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital city of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street har@@ sh and illegal drugs are all daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for men &apos;s services .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ style of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing who can im@@ itate the hair@@ style hair@@ style .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ style , which go to the ultimate borders of fantasy and creativity has even been inspired by an annual event that has been taking part in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts sign each other to show , who can create the ex@@ centr@@ alized L@@ ooks , how to see in the following video ( other videos about current competitions there is on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here a opportunity to find out young people of it , replacing their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , which makes it possible to find work in the hair@@ dresser , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the next opportunity , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported about some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the congregation and the district which we are very proud , because of love to the children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ vo .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ messenger to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists , &quot; published an international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel em@@ itting , aff@@ ection for something ?
exactly this question came to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , giving young people to write gu@@ er@@ ill@@ iter@@ ate letters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ abe@@ es F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International became the sign@@ atories to the peace agreement as important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before Columbus , however , there is a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and around the clock had contributed their weapons . they have to integrate them into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases , has to record them in their ranks , and support them with the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ans have to join themselves and help the integration process .
and they did exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former gu@@ err@@ illa , to call them back in society .
the objective of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists - who will then be handed to personally personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Letters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there had Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the possibility to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the people who love thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need to need a lot more need@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plan , he told us to share his love with people this year , who needed most ur@@ gent matters .
so , the plan to write a letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of war with a common history of peace . &quot;
previously , more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art in the camp to translate the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC appeared as they had previously done to counter@@ accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters in protecting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that is between , &quot; telling the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ ors of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a type of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa person who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because in addition to him there was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ er , a dead@@ ly weapon in the village of the village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never ever written in my life , that is why I answered it . &quot; since I suddenly had my tears about the che@@ eks .
I moved him quite quickly , and set me beside the Pom@@ ena .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I felt sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this dam@@ sel , and wanted to write this letter .
the man told me more than his life . he never had something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger . &quot; I never thought that someone might be forgiven me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a company outside , waiting for us with open arms .
till now I have learned what I had to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is over , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and several leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group .
the students were all grew up as a war and ended the F@@ ARC already in secret places .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into her views on the peace process . &quot; for many years , we have experienced how to develop our social in@@ justice on the whole of the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the company in that country .
for a target of these magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people listen to so far had never found their hearing and no elec@@ toral law , and to recognize that people who have been often seen as Monster and even hate , even people with nice feelings that were turned out by their hab@@ its and their environment was very painful for me .
the truth , in which the land lives , does hurt me .
but I comfort me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bite , and give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i the following letter :
the column was prophesied that after de@@ struc@@ tive peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take care of weapons and protest to their rights . this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we use F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology are an@@ gled - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our post and bring sacrifices , because we know from own experience , that nothing is easy . den@@ among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties shall be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way we will give it a lot of obstacles , but we will overcome them together .
a woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life of Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa , and its first published in the website OC Media .
hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large range of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ar@@ pressing .
with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of the persecution of Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends how a o@@ cl@@ onal value is on the number of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only made by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman of Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and has spoken about what happened in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published , which were the towing , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ atic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light to the Methods of Che@@ chen authorities that arrested que@@ fied que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt in reality since her childhood , that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced of sex after sex , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
she was afraid of her life to the last En@@ des in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a wife that put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone , by whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round about my W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few grocery bags from the back seat of my cars , I heard a male voice , &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you do the family even more honour ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the last du@@ des in the hospital again .
apparently some women had happened to sh@@ out and started to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I heard that I had two key@@ ries in my right lung poultry .
OC Media : in which medical wings were you laid - in men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete since my male name is up ; but the doctor stand and laid me on women .
for this reason I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his offices , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , an Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as good man .
I am than@@ k@@ ful to him that he has gone resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they called me , and wrote me - relatives , and some perfect diso@@ be@@ dience .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they issued ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some said to me that I had to prove it without passing through the streets ; others said that I had not changed in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only fl@@ aw@@ ful , and Photoshop .
I have body size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for her .
some older people said to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They brought a monster to the world , that has not just your family , but the whole republic has damaged .
we can not touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to van@@ ish from here . &quot;
my mother became too much , and she turned a sn@@ ap around the neck .
than@@ k@@ fully , the neighbours and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved in an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a plate of 95 .
after it happened for the third time it was clear that there was a la@@ zy .
my human rights show reviews the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country but then something un@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to phone my m@@ om as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without having to register without interrup@@ tions .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked at the hotel .
the number was registered at a fore@@ igner .
I set the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe it , you warm@@ est in safety , only because you left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel du plug . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about sex . however , this is a tab@@ le@@ topic .
some of the Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements are always in me .
so very much I wish I could not overcome this se@@ el@@ ian barrier .
I always say that , as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we chat with camera I will actually give me about how the person is watching some of her past - so on my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are d@@ ord@@ oned ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington for last week .
I needed to find current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who underwent a one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an he was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the Ram@@ ad@@ an Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he closed a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
this means that I would like to invite their relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof of that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; of blood from blood .
OC Media : are they still recorded in these secret results ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it wasn &apos;t really many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when , before all those who have no family , or have left their relatives in order to set up the Kad@@ y@@ rows of trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they will be imprisoned there so that they can present they later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be brought to show her body in television and claim that they had attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ mer@@ ed to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is it only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I taught someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was carried away even when these people were taken .
however , until now they were not introduced into band@@ its , but there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why else could I not allowed this people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and demonstrations of people who are part of a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I had never encoun@@ tered problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never problems .
on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to the &quot; Civil Pro@@ cedure , &quot; but ultimately dropped into the stone times .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were bent ; I had coloured eyelashes , carried tube je@@ ans and short to@@ fu .
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially in weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never revi@@ ved .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; mo@@ ck not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children , if they are fun with sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes closed from you because they believed they are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never stopped me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row took on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he didn &apos;t talk about us per se , but also about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - they could feel how people began to change in the city .
who was bor@@ row@@ ed before , laugh@@ ed at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I won &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
apart from that , I still worked as activists .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ able with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ ting , gathering , I join them to hospital and help them to get eating cards .
I leave no cents for that .
I discovered this people itself , when I was hiding refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ thi@@ est .
so the nature , that has purely nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , which would like to do with foam before the mouth that there is no g@@ ay at them .
the da@@ em@@ ans who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner , who have the Russians also have ; but on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ised Muslims who go into the mosque , and fast@@ en them in the Ram@@ ad@@ an fast@@ en - live with men .
know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ental in men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a Tru@@ g@@ ator .
these are two different things - two different types of feelings to be exact , different hab@@ it settings .
for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I am here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ ned in front of an increase of self @-@ moral within the armed Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z Region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ moral .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with approval .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under attack resi@@ dues , depression , and rel@@ ates himself for his own help to come up for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights groups that work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had already kindled itself .
some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide in August that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority in August , and activ@@ ist before the site that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights found that several other - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged this month .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family v@@ ans who felt on persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ able to do their families and maintain their safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment , and discrimination
the region , which is based on a large majority of Iran living in the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis that makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population .
before a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran .
there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the A@@ wa@@ z region and some of the richest and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to remain slow , and the local population receives only little from that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illness , hunger and kidn@@ apping .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s systematically systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ ons that are water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are in the way .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dry destruction , and local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , finished in primary school , 55 % a secondary school completed and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Ken@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activists in London , talked to Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ moral among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment is more serious . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic people and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since Fun@@ ctional and Institu@@ tions do not use Arab working forces , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is leaving the access to work possibilities in all sectors .
that is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of National Resistance of young Arab@@ s and forced them to make their living halt outside of their hom@@ eland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their name and sur@@ name , to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even as the Arab name will not be toler@@ ated at the workplace , sof@@ ten as the speaking of Arabic language or Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances which must end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activ@@ ates the human rights , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait if the world rising up and it &apos;s knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treated with perpet@@ ual depression and is avoid@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the statement that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions were published .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , some women - especially white women , who draw itself as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
you even have a well thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money despite the same formation than men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent demands when it comes to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidem@@ ic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms are still aff@@ ecting that women were so@@ jour@@ ned or later in various areas of life at a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still per@@ verse through the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is deliber@@ ately and known .
I &apos;m convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to contact skin , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or in black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have been used , on what kind of bo@@ di@@ ly , se@@ el@@ ian and verb@@ al ab@@ used , many white femin@@ ists , and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
but they all agree that women - all women should come together to sing &quot; their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to reach equality ( some ) of the women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , a separate form of motiv@@ ated violence that we are exposed to a choice of black women .
or about that black women and women other Eth@@ nic and country of origin less des@@ erve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background more often the school are refer@@ enced as a white girl , due to obvious integrity issues .
or that women in black spin@@ ach and women with a migration background to higher risk are exposed to domestic violence , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand I want to have all the women , all men and all men of any kind in the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join me as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman is ref@@ uses to take into account that both of the sex as well as the skin colour of one person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and won no more about my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere @-@ oriented sphere , who always rejected me and countless other black women forever .
in 1851 , in her speech : &quot; am I no woman ? &quot; and I also w@@ alled me to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman in a historical regard is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alized being .
I like to join me in group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural approach to prop@@ el their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to draw white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . because some of them still try the meaning of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to recover it a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give wives from different origins a home and to ren@@ ces from white Femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I take it before me to resol@@ ve me full and all of femin@@ ism , which was established for my dark skin and my status as a woman &apos;s life , rather than me for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
it is more important than ever before we have to define black women to our own performances and give us into the sphere , which are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana Dan@@ an@@ ism : as we ourselves can defend us , in which they can defend us , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , se@@ ag@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rejected , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called Separ@@ at@@ ism and Ex@@ clu@@ sion , after they read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m I existed .
I am recognized as a woman as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment , in which my life neither passed , nor igno@@ red , is still denied .

in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by c@@ tur@@ f . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ l ) that is reported about women in Paraguay against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people affected .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its exclusive partner who had become an old partner .
since the end of their relationship has been some time , and the police said , their statement would not be turned to the files , but more could not do .
when a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was indicated for mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , also the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was used .
a few days later , the second woman moved its ad .
the famine of violence against women is difficult .
if women seem to be advert@@ ised at all , they generally get no support on the state .
in many cases , women also are fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse they . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence to be found at all in the prosec@@ utions authorities .
content 1 Inclu@@ des and Statist@@ ical 2 Un@@ visible abuse and legal system , which is nothing under@@ graduate of the Islamic laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it is hard to define how many women are really har@@ assed , My@@ án Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ y on the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that however , not even an@@ sat@@ ary to demonstrate the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; says it .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney General of 9@@ 600 ads passed by domestic violence . 70 % of them went around violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
more than 5000 ads were given for domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically motiv@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics show , however , not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an female Secretary of Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these offen@@ ders are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who are not refundable in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
on every woman who are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay , no criminal off@@ ences can not be reas@@ on@@ ably documented , as many women are murdered every year by its current or former partners .
by August 2016 there were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country alone .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered in their current or former partners .
according to their estimates dies in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violence against men .

invisible abuse and legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning it didn &apos;t want to do so , but now she should repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years since the psych@@ ic violence on the other side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time clearly recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would be a victim of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it , I thought that only women happens to be sub@@ contra@@ cted by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his charges and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , among them also Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch whether he ever lifted up his hand against them and refused to be a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen this so long from Carlos and had not left him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that sacrifice of abuse at least a certain cred@@ itor would have had .
in Paraguay , Victoria Santos , who was not out of Paraguay , fought in Paraguay with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partners joined them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do that , as many others do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
your prosp@@ erous partner managed to convince them to convince her .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as View to the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she did not received any support .
it carried out a process against their former partners , who developed into an un@@ ic@@ able judicial war between Paraguay and its home country , in which it mainly went about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied .
the ad of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Als@@ ace ( # inter@@ c@@ ession ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ bricks ) are part of a campaign that supports Am@@ nesty International .
the bill of the bill proposes to explain Fem@@ ale @-@ d to a autonomous pen@@ alties , as already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points , in order to destroy the MPs to the law , that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions would be banned , which currently in Paraguay are generally prohibited and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original Bill had provided the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) tax , which currently has to bear the victims of violence , if they simply want to create an ad placement and to lay a safe place to establish the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law should not be effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources available :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships .
here you have to think that violence is no longer regarded as a little standard .
whoever tru@@ th@@ inks in the presence of these facts is th@@ ist@@ ed and helps to get the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rator .
we must allow for such a long time permit until mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among others a passage was cancelled , which the partners en@@ acted in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor , to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; political force , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of the law , however , is considered a great retreat .
this article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by c@@ tur@@ f . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ l ) that reported about women &apos;s conscience in Paraguay .

independent Media in Oman has further exposed a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; this website has been closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; is read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , because of its coverage over corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is banned a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed before the court , but later returned .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he had depos@@ ed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state theatre .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Minister of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially the domestic confi@@ denti@@ ality , public liber@@ ties , independent journalists , blog@@ ger and other activists , advoc@@ ate and in@@ car@@ ded .
authorities of peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights systematically systematic and hin@@ ds citizens , also activists , to express their views over the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention , three of their editors last year , is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was prohibited by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , having appeared in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , with the title &quot; Hoch@@ ran@@ ean parties to bind the hands of Justice &quot; . this was corruption by the judicial authorities and the mixture of high @-@ level civil servants .
in the report , government officials were accused of having judges the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in a inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ ir Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a member of the Edit@@ orial Committee , was charged at the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the Deputy Editor of the editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j to act as che@@ er@@ ful editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , prohibited from 9th August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held in Mas@@ k@@ at the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both amongst others due to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the state &quot; .
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience and found guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found entitled &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a danger for the public order . &quot;
a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed on 22 August 2016 , and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , but sentenced to six months in prison to Al @-@ Ha@@ j , and sentenced to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in jail for a six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison sentence of Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he is banned his imprisonment sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal adopted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n re@@ tre@@ ad , the newspaper looks like attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information also signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the Minister of Appeal dismissed another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to re@@ sign the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in Oman at recent time .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ communication
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not even mentioned . this is a growing area that is addressed to one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of performing medical research , there are two reasons for a lack of the global health sector , covering many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical industry .
second , research that is conducted by African scientists itself is helping to develop its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth in the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for expl@@ oring inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidem@@ ic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied at HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of media over this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier says as private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment my focus is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) using laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what are your opinion according to the important recent scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
that must change , otherwise we will always stay the receiver , instead of yourself M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often not used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
G@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
projects are well funded differently .
it &apos;s hard to find people who come back or come here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work , which you did not have before ?
RW : the fundamental infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs lots of money , a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught in order to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should focus on it , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all ages .
there is need of special scientific training starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , resear@@ ching of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are greatly benef@@ iting .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the resulting access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the U.S. to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers are global food production .
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solvents for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding with Frank Mort@@ on since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been emb@@ ell@@ ished .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only possible due to its own exp@@ ir@@ ons and the question as many sor@@ ts of sor@@ ts can be set .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that even more sal@@ ads were patented , so that he could not be able to breeding them .
the patents are not only valid for individual types but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cont@@ ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as cer@@ eal or boxes origin@@ als . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts take care of food security around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs Sal@@ ad , but he needs more , since his work is becoming increasingly difficult because of his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is when I have a rock in a river , where I must p@@ add@@ ling it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents go in sal@@ ads too far .
and if they stand before court , no one can breed a new sal@@ ads , because all features are patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and trying to figure out those characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have cultivated red Romans sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; building , &quot; which is cultivated and eaten . it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds as sounds as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) is inspir@@ ing by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and gen@@ ic are not being protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently used for plant bre@@ eders .
in the context of the initiative , just Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could also commit that others can freely use the seeds being able to freely use seeds .
this , however , does not mean that they can do not do business with their seed and can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders for only others to breeding their seed , and it is not immediately for@@ ged - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of dozens and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
economic prospects for prospects
Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i @-@ board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breeding new plants , especially important for food security as well as for environmental protection .
seed plays to him a role in major merge such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to take the latter not or just as little as they cultivated plants with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not to buy our goal of ecological agriculture , the most recent examples of mer@@ cies in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples is to buy , locally , locally and sustain@@ ably reproduci@@ ble vegetables , such as the species is offered on farms , also ought to know how that vegetables are bred , threatened .
dietary sover@@ eig@@ ity without seed sover@@ eign is not possible . &quot;
members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make others their seed remains free of charge . that is , in contrast , seed and plant features are to be patented .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i @-@ Suppor@@ ters ensure that the future of food supply is at risk since the available gene pool due to the always abundant intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always restricted to in@@ flow .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all Kart@@ ing features are protected as intellectual property , making it either not used for plant bre@@ eders at either no or less .
for other plants , such estimates are still not , but experts like Lu@@ by avoided plants like wheat in the larger style were patented as a salad or carrots .
a question of Vis@@ ions
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted features - from such that their taste or its color improves up to such that th@@ ri@@ ves them in certain environments , and thre@@ ats driving diseases such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents upon plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material used to bre@@ eders through increasingly more patents . genetic variety is currently more need@@ less than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse than ever before climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to ensure that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ e activities . with a total of four gen@@ cies and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , the company set itself for the conservation of genetic diversity .
she resi@@ sted , however , the view that intellectual property collec@@ ts other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ions fo@@ ster innovation &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken to be a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
such protection thus in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years to wait until a patent process , and surely make no innovation .
and if you have to wait for such a long time to bre@@ eders plants that are adapted to the amended environmental conditions , the fight had already lost .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources should always have been a general practition@@ er and there should be still remains : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ting incenti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make their work easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is due to the concept of making plant features : &quot; we are not really creating the characteristics itself .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we ultimately didn &apos;t know how the plants do it .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder , plant in the U.S. state of Oregon and Oss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who needs a variety , under@@ taking its own values in them .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of her@@ b@@ icide , bre@@ eders into his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is just anti . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , the most small seed companies can survive , either if they are either re@@ ject or re@@ ject it for too expensive and therefore it is not worthwhile too , or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder by the Av@@ oid of plant @-@ patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like that I am dealing with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need a new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors may sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent man is being protected from competition for 20 years , so how to make it very nice . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
though the U.S. seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; cat@@ tery , the concept spreads very quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes themselves as a professional organization in the area of resources . to preserve the seed of traditional farm crops , the center together with farmers and helps them to breeding new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; Open Source &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Oss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding they differ from country to country , ab@@ sent not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventi@@ onally @-@ cultivated plants should not be patented . thus it speaks for the present practice of the European Patent Office , the patents in conventi@@ onally cultivated plants .
however , a declaration is not yet a law ; now it is to carry out the governments of the Member States to carry out this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference entitled &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from over East Africa , to learn more about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed plant movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ ent@@ ability of seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently constru@@ cting a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed plant systems for the scheduled next year of official starting signal .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group of ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ence - a ban from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - publishes a report that farmers have to come to promote and improve seed politics , so that a stable supply can be ensured through food supplies .
in this report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a connection between the Lu@@ by by Oss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly seen , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that more behind her food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock the contents on the Internet .
it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government shut down the website of the Russian Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities for this step was sharp and promised to continue working and efforts on human rights in the region .
in spite of this attack , the Network for Human Rights Information Is ignor@@ ant despite this attack and the Constitution by the authorities that the law should continue to defend their goal and not so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical options are exhau@@ sted to overcome them and not to ad@@ mit . we hope to continue our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered as the first cen@@ sored website of human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities have blocked over two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaze@@ era network for con@@ genital &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights ab@@ uses Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not to reach websites and media .
well , the blog , which he met in order to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government , even aim of an attack .
blog@@ ger , the provider at which Zi@@ adas blog is located , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while taking over the student protests and recorded a video about the police , physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly about politics and the human rights issues in Egypt .
in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking through the government and refle@@ cting what this means to him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi , but even though the blocking of blo@@ gs could not seem significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been successful to give me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , a temp@@ ter murder , loading in the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I wrote not for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it for the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have closed it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mud will go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) closed Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this cap@@ tiv@@ ated technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ an al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers in the conversion of Internet at@@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12 June we noticed how to offer the blocking of websites that began V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
a such practice indicates that the government &apos;s intention to block content and fil@@ tering the Egyptian users could have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will be wor@@ m@@ ated that the decision @-@ makers behind closed doors , thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis for which they can proceed against this actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

day for day papers in Brazil with par@@ sing head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard drawing .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was assassin@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es smo@@ kers with military weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8,@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and air air to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the 2017 presidential election reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization , called Global Justice , called the United Nations .
reports such as these are always daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the detailed information on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on August 16th is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new category called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the town are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world such as murder , rough@@ y , sexual intercourse , etc . all that happens by civil@@ ised standards and what only happens in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , that we did not close our eyes as journalists in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video which was divided on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of Chief Apostle , declared that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist &apos;s newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security , Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the article , the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , may also be used to leave the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot , and then ask any questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war , based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and their partner is .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journ@@ alism in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against violence as &quot; war &quot; . this is difficult to just@@ ify a just@@ ification of failed safety policy by the media and could make it difficult , responsibility for the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , re@@ conn@@ aissance and a historical and self @-@ pleasing failure of public service .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro state is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the North and northeast of the country . these are the most current available data .
no one of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look forward to the mur@@ als per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for these safety @-@ related measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Nacional fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit , founded by the state of Rio in 2003 , aims to capture a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and placed a unit permanently there .
at the beginning , this was actually resulted in a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for a few years the U@@ PP was to protect against the poor communities of the poor communities that was to protect the neo @-@ armed police unit .
on his Facebook page quoted in 2010 by the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio would not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name of &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of Rio in Rio is also serious consequences for men .
for this is calling for the state , means and paths which are typical for war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is a silent point in the landscape and an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; ir@@ rig@@ ated balls . &quot;
war , or her , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police seized the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ u@@ zin@@ ho qu@@ om@@ m to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident occurred : an or@@ kers died because of pe@@ an@@ uts , who had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the following Civil War , many Syrian cities suffer from violent siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a common initiative of the Peace Institute PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the surrounding , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib at present about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
particularly strong is the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons took place on 21 August 2013 , the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre had been practic@@ ed from the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by the reb@@ els controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to the inhabitants taken away from the authorities , or for@@ wards by tun@@ nels and control points .
through the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional food supplies are become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as counter@@ participation a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nearby and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria planted food and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however , it makes them an attractive destination for many people of besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , subscription Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years since three years , this project has been fighting and pressed his relief , making it more and more &quot; acquain@@ t@@ ance . &quot;
in order to collect cash for the initiative , use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nearby the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge to decor@@ ate fung@@ i , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution , they have achieved more than 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to earn donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is based on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel : locally produced fuel produced from plastic used to feed generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us &quot; before they checked their quality , and they are not suitable for consumption .
they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was accomplished , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed them throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring to humans the mushroom breeding of various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self catering by producing food resi@@ dues ( like paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to obtain new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
create new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible .
we want that our experience will be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese ask for Justice to the victims of 2017
several hundred people attended the 21st of October in many regional capit@@ als in Portugal and requested righteousness for the victims of fires that gr@@ abs in the week before the north of Portugal .
two and forty @-@ two persons died , and approximately 70 were injured following the forest fires , from 15 to 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires out@@ breaks which spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande happened a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry System , which monitored the forest areas by satellite TV , in 2017 alone , approximately 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal - an area surrounded by the district of Lisbon .
thus you can make a better image from the serious situation : there is only in 4 districts not a fire .

the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive maintenance measures by the state .
the people asked why the civilian protection was not able to enter the extent of the tragedy so far as possible
João Sover@@ al declared by the covenant of farmers from Portugal to the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did so no@@ where : there are dozens of open roads , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June , since the roads were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in est@@ i@@ als are question@@ ed with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forest @-@ form , which had brought the government after serious bre@@ aches in 2003 and 2005 , was established by the Commun@@ es which saw the new rules as a barrier to investment .
&quot; the government led an Lock@@ heed of the Act that allowed the construction activity of the case - that was an open back@@ door case that everything was built , &quot; João Sor@@ val was further stated in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the Quer@@ cus , focused on it that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made from easily combust@@ ible wood , sat down like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ie , according to fires of this kind .
to these problems , it is added that the site of the civilian protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , sought more information , or tried to contact relatives .
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : you took their own civilian data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and inform@@ ing the population in real time over the location and spread of fires .
the project was set up by the developer João P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive for this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the server had followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who were not standing : there were more than half a million registered site .

the journey from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the Taliban officially began in Afghanistan .
two years before , a terrible war between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group broke out , who had overcome the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan , Afghanistan , became a land of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati is a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even though his mother did not know it then , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the dawn of the dawn , the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would fet@@ ch him , and bring him to the tugs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat leader was just murdered by the Taliban and a lot of Haz@@ ara were suddenly denied .
the Taliban presented for their hat@@ red against the Min@@ ara did not come closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af took refuge in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ ab@@ ru@@ be . work was heavily and made him sick .
then he took what was left out of his low wage , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and wor@@ shi@@ ped sacks with mort@@ ar that were heavier than he himself to make his living .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran were characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in a deser@@ ted building on the construction site where we worked well .
there were no facilities there and no heating . we covered nylon in front of the open window , so that we were not exhau@@ sted at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
on the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities turned his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed twice on the day of Essen .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high growth rates a kind of second chance for expired asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are cat@@ astroph@@ ic in the country .
the UN Human Rights Organization for Europe writes , the system &quot; has been suffering from transparency under a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception areas . &quot; this is impro@@ vised operations in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre , if officially applied for asylum in the asylum request , may apply for months after the registration of asylum request .
until then people who have no money for an accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
that way also A@@ shar@@ af came .
but his un@@ inten@@ tional Li@@ w@@ ille helped A@@ shar@@ af to free from these conditions soon .
after he had made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af talked about his entire story in the founding of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while still a second hostel opened and a snap@@ shot .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; handic@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cra@@ cy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , several of them created a company , including break@@ age , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even served in Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea about his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ ani entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Cab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome there are also Afghanistan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ical industry and retail , and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave left for teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I am not happy if I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all the others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also has plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where the people may sell packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; thus , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt but at the end stand stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
