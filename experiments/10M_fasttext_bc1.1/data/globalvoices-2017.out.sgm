<seg id="1">Although I visited the United States at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read about American music, American authors, and his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profoundly deep effect on me that I was mostly conducted by a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearful reporter who covered a murderous conspiracy by Julia Roberts as a Jura student. the Supreme Court judges whose interest were inclined.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method One, "I was it if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country to live in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you are always that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equine people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very bad love letter concerning its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his Engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, like a former colleague, and proclaimed his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned to him for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican parliamentary elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support this biguage person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to kill Trump and his electors in harmony with the people who had learned during my period during my period.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also Trumps World view is not associated with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also reflected in contrast to generosity, which I experienced by Sandy Bahr that I struggling for life long the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who received me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who helped me with a lot of patience and wormwood and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose arms has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those people and those emitted by them are deepening my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidates, they gave me a stop and the equivalent to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt of non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either represented by its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the Trump-voters than Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people must submit, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to us in that situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act on another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters want to have tuned for Trump, because they would like to win control over a country that they disappointing?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in that America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruelly decision to raise a man who looks look down with regard to those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.).: as much as "rejection of white against all other Ethnic," vocabulary from white in motion to the White and whiplash, as the big Van Jones named, has the fact that America has so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chosen as its president, twice the son of a Kenite, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise to and says: to Hell with perseverity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all these I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word exchange with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The people responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have one place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do you have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God be thanked to Mr. Trump, isn't your America." 36 hours later he was put right.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And I will break my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "recycled Instruments" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraean city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played at both places is not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby dominate Colombian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has now been playing in the community: a family of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments a possibility of overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the land-violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project, and the youth had so called a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias - Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the largest landfill of Asuncion in Paraguay - on instruments that are made of recovered waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments made of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under management of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to make parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments are classified snatches, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, reminiscent of the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsing at the same place, where parents had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them live not together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown that he had never seen before: a violin was produced from a trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and calls to The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">This Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork could successfully fight against illegal fisheries</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combat the wild illegal fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that informs about international and practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">At that time, in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated in lian waters of illegal fishing, before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were brought to this way over the demon and a little inclined, to welcome an amiceculiar of this type at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to feed one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "the Premier is surrounded by countries which easily refused everything" "", "recalls the Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the sailing time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the area of the region: it did not succeed to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative which crosses criminal practices and resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing) in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar to six countries, which then sold the Premier from its waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries who are uniqued and work together. they exchange information and stand in each other when it goes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support. "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by the definition: what is imprisoned, is hidden, but because it is extremely difficult to get up. hence the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">A deliberate contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species can be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems will harm balance, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fisheries were once proclaimed through bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snow-emptoro, with the information between individual countries, traceable with traceability at FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">In there, the individual countries can replace lists of listed licenses, news for suspect activity or details that are noticed or learned during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships even very attentive when moving to the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark Ships that are used in forbidden areas - such as suspected driving conditions, such that a ship invites its caught fish on the go to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can indicate whether the participating ships have a fishing licence if they were on the road and possibly even if they have a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are protected against illegal fishing companies can refuse to the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to make the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there's a considerable losses for the owners, meaning that illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And this is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leader director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to spend an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, the eight members of the network HISH-i every year lose intrusion because of the illegal fishers who are incurred in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna ffish stocks, which attracts commercial fishing companies in all over the world, including those illegal fishers.</seg>
<seg id="122">The practices include things include like the sailing under false flag, fake royals, specifying of imaginations, fish protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a complete organized control system." "" "long ago, a ship was illegal and a country could say" "" "you did not start my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me '." "" "and exactly this legalized hatching tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 exploration of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to spread the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it tracked and found refuge.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the International High Authority on Crime, FISH-i can provide information on illegal fishing over large distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our research lead us rather far into the networks of organizational crimes," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i should have suspected ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships which would like to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very elaborated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO that deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems as you can't get any more of satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system which combines various information levels. FISH-i will help to find out criminating ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's Team of African nations can actually take effect on this undoubtedly a global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Sea protection organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be rendered to the world's position of every traceable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it, he who is doing," "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to join forces and to bundles their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts have to run a similar project when using a global system for the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel detective, but also cries out.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be confused without licence and hardly to calculate with consequences, do they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since then fishing boats have been purchased more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had put together Greko 1, inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose mission is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Even other countries notice this success. "the effect is so strongly that us now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries together in 2015, for the so-called West Africa Task Force. even they fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model such as FISH-i. "" With safety, the aim is to bring even more of such initiatives and structures also in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a licence and were not allowed to be banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also raced in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen in Somalia. "with the take of action against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time the evidence is that such a special, collaborative work towards the protection of oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela can only seem to be the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the reorder of Venezuela) can be viewed from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lands of Barinas, in the Andes-regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central north of the German Bundestag on Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Eparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorated continuously, which makes it possible for lack of food and medications in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the order of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro a chance for a fundamental change; but ultimately, the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>

<seg id="163">As part of social, political and economic crisis, which is estimated to be the highest in the inflation and economic crisis (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% at the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine is considered to be the only way to conquer the country, its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="200">In the meanwhile grown-grown man Quijano now in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, the crimes were examined during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the burden, same name as his father worn down to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation, I believed that it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years old you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know at that time, that my father was a thief, folklore and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarerian official. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence division 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me at the military base, I often went into the sports hall. there I had a boy, who made martial sport for me.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-white photo and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revcionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of revolutionaries workers in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be in order. for so my father loved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the base point I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University concludes, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'where the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he brought me into a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply all possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small piece of wrap and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Barracks where the stolen objects were left and subjected to a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I paralysed in, and saw a Liege, tortured on men.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that she was attached to an end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was fasted there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They faded a man with hands on the bed, overshot him with water, and pursued it for 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stank there was tawful... like a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same odour came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in distress.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much grief to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I didn't know that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he brought me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were milled with hands and were armed.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people went down with the face down - all were greased at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance kaumined people still quietly upon the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noted that I saw to the detainees, he said, "What do you look like this?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "why did you meet me, why have you brought me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I didn't know that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this, because my father told you home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La Cuadra some rooms, which were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to information from survivors of civil, Jorge Romero is also indicted in the La Perla Ribera Process, which is also called RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death).</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video, Emilio Fessia, the leader of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The path, which you come in, is also the way to come down here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When looking at the map, you see that they were about this path and tortured then for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of emptying a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the Euphemism - for the shooting of mankind and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War of war'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things, at home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war of war" - as they knew it was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - I became clear that war is a bayonet or perhaps military combat which one has fought against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothing, paintings, money... others, then there is no war, but Vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked myself, as my father, who was head of security forces in that Vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do it.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I answered: and thou, who stand up cars on the streets?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded me, crying me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and kill you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one another!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in trial, I showed a photo of then, on which I bore a jacket and scoop of wool. both had my father of La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor but he still brought clothing at home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Then, the defence asked me to have been a miter for this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay me on a burden for what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was so anyway to declare.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the dead is the final abheculiar Akt'.</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I think I Reue.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you only have children, you recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognise that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have been executed during the dictatorship. but why the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why to perform children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with his home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always turned the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">One would have been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was simply decided to kill those people. but what pses are to disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not even families who could maintain their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the dead is the final abhy act, which can be attached to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was reintroduced again to eliminate the remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were shredded and no idea - no idea where. "you will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to declare it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 Crime - including my Father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea to display my father was taken during a conversation when he stood under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="350">Elaboration of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos, he was also who made the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun daily published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such a English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insulating for older people and in an international city like Kyoto, simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was first removed at first. the designation "(German:" terrible drivers ") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammatisch is not the correct name" Elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture are reapologized for the translation of translation. furthermore, it stated that the error was already contained in the text that they had been checked out from translators and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was released.</seg>

<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounces as an inappropriate description of elderly car drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents that are involved in accidents in the country, but quite a lot to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005, which equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens claimed 1.803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation is manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of target language - somewhat, which is in the case of mother tongue. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the main language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native language should translate from English to French - not by French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese firms do not employ a staff with English as native language that could have translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, quotas or the relatively low number of English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, however, have to be employed, however, the Japanese staff, whose English language is considered the best to be considered as the best - no matter how good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The advertised and enigmatic propositions which are made by machine translation shows that this technology can replace yet long no human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangely English formulation in Japan, among them also the enigmatic imprints, often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry yet acceptable or at least harmless. but of large enterprises or from the government who have funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users, that they had no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet connection from VPITV and El Capitolio TV will be no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations also contributed in the protests of protests in Caracas, who were organized by oppositional groups that contradicate the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the responsibilities of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the findings of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is glued and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been relying on coverage of protests since 2014. then, the Commission for Telecommunication then threatened them with fines and closure, when the Commission would continue to report this as "call for violence."</seg>

<seg id="405">Earlier research institute of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, have shown that the local internet providers may use DNA. thus, it is a technique that concerns the DNS server inquiries of certain domains.</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while sitting in custody for police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV resumed.</seg>

<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she started working as Criadita to work for the family. in Paraguay, they called for more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a great family with little money is giving birth to her minors son or her younger daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned above, is that the children have to pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and sacrifice of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised within the framework of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">In Paraguay, this known as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga has worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In this case they said with Criaditas, especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the Criaditas, guaranteed in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double disappointment," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is one of the family that their daughter in the faith to improve their position in society so that they can make their position in society and "something out of it" can make a different family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family is that the girl take up and his exploitation with the faith justifies that they would give someone a chance that would never be any training, and perhaps he would be hungry.</seg>

<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela formed deep in the parayan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited for workers, they live also isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>

<seg id="457">Her brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the road or market sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asuncion as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">At the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">They had to share the time so that you still had time to learn to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up at five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday, for example, they cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and the infected floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she returned home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they ever had finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture by Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Released under public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently approved a bill of bill to "the regulations concerning the use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is adopted by Parliament, users and users have to register social media in Egypt for government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a spot would then be set up, which therefore instructs the citizens and citizens to use social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the assumption of the Act you would have to register users on the site with their right names and staff numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it is missed to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others via voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how to enact the law, as the draft notification has not been adopted, as the Egyptian authorities is not able to impose users to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not registered in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarians and promoters of the Legislative Council, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a password to get through the firewall that blocks us. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall at national level around Facebook. due to them it would be necessary to submit informations about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site experts are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological () of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights,"), talked to Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have strong attention to the technical capacities and the understanding of any neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion it is possible to imagine that just as they are forcible to the physical public and private spaces that could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, this means that they must be a powerful surveillance system to feed citizens, which means a licence request or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to bring it to a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not really realistic - but in Egypt all things are possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft proposal must initially be discussed in the legislature of parliament and the constitutional committee before it enters a debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement is not being successful or not, the draft "stands in line with one pro-military think in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no different anings on the image surface is," says Raoist.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, which through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fraction of their habitat, as they always find less prey, endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of Leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video showing, "is the Perspective Leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of ecosystem depend on it that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is low and goes against zero. when the team is therefore fixed, that she's a recording of a big cat at the camera's all, raza is out of pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologica, Raza passionate about another side of their country, which consists not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in wild animals since six years and participated in wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the Kahoku Shouto daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo achieved the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those who were affected by the "Triple disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Prefecture of Miyagi, the Prefecture of Miyagi, had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami of the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring counctures Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated, since the tsunami had vanish all the coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still had a nuclear accident, and therefore some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows that progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper's detailed report contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (and that of it), saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the largest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of all houses, whereas Fukushima happened its final lamp with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years later, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behavior, evacuation of you to settle in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the Thirty Catastrophe, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in Behaviour accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated in Fukushima still lives in emergency shelters, whereas more than 75 percent of the evacuated persons lived after the disaster in Behaviour accommodation, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, this figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, 1074 from 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, have reopened its doors by December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing licenses in Iwate and Miyagi have now come into service, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have been caught in the area of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that just a consequence of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the land of Fukushima, lie in the nuclear threat. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered far more, but Fukushima still remains undefeated in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again to 90 per cent on the same stand, as before the misfortune. Fukushima happened only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, there are more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To establish a total image, the newspaper introduced numerous aspects of the native population and under the evacuated by. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their anger has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey by more about the tsunami awareness among native people experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey provided that 83.1 percent of the local resident population have taken action to be prepared to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of respondents say that still lack of disaster prevention had been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those being evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has strengthened its attention to the location of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture in Fukushima had also been the witness of the worst, catastrophic provoking, the Japan had to experience ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes areas most of the evacuated areas are older than 50 years old. you have to compete in proper conditions, because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come from other countries that speak a different language, the differences were first to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, it is often recognizes that more links than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they demand our advantages, expand our perspectives and recall that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this sequence of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get less attention in coverage than they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember one moment in which they have felt very reasonably linked to someone above language and international borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krivoy speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish, Tori Egheri says, like a migration of their affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias speaks about the time, where they look back to the music of all over the world in London; and Joey ayoub looks back on his experiences, which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer in GoiÃ¢nia took him in a demonstration against the head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull of brain trauma and several fragments.</seg>
<seg id="597">Physicians operated on his Saturday and have now translated it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures also shows the face of the police officer, which was attacked with a buzzling reef. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident in the case of active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, such as he beats in GoiÃ¢nia with his comrade on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would blow from a demonstrators and on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months, and the whole repression would be justified with that.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolayador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, distributed by Luiz da Luz, where you see how Mateus is attacked by police officers and several renovations went to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the below shown clip, you see the attack on Mateus down the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, which lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) in order to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in GoiÃ¢nia, while living in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s.</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiencing a wave of political power: here, the activist Guilherme Irish of his father was murdered, because he has attacked the Occupy's Military Police with a Gasleck, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen who struck him with a headstock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police grips</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived in police officers for protesters last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were shooting at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had built a stage for speakers, rubber handles and drumengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), intreated the police via speaker failing on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha, S. Paulo, one of the oldest papers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Again, the Brazilian media protector once again decoded by focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window pulley.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha of S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a fragile glass windows in order to illustrate their original cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo gave a cover story with a fixed bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of people than the protests by thousands of people who are in defence of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognise if it is strict against any type of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "Vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate importance, and the typical violence of the military police are questioned by headlines with the title "dismantled on confrontation path with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">Introducing the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba has closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of the Gregorian de Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugars, regardless of what there is no significant sugar-harvested on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities produced in the sugarcane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After getting there, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost and after its plants, until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Around 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commutes to the factories which are still milled per day.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldier veteran who stands in the morning every day at 4: 00 a.m. the crisis in the sugarcane industry doesn't seem to sleep his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are working in the east of the region of sugar cane factories which were once again in operation after long inactive time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of having heard that in MaÃ±alI would receive the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tube industry is already the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the efficiency, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country before some decades, but the bad harvests are no new anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the village saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and barely competitive, they were unportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories which annual production targets amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the antioxidant crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased before about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar varies between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Nutrition Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the rough sugar would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the day's day is going to enter into history," the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">It happened in the sugarcane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alI on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated in most, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first of the first year, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written about documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed, the address, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulf Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could make any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there, the responsibility and letters were increasingly being more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the factory-set factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money, the insured.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another complex of Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will, at the disclosure of the factory, where it helped to help.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part that he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workstations was removed.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there were no alternatives for jobs and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, then president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that factories had been in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the Volkswagende Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alI learned that many things are changing, but not always to better if a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory decided or better, when they began to decompose them, they also heard on the asphalt roads, it also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>

<seg id="692">Teenagers of the First Nations communities in Canada do deal with topics that are important for them. they do they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, since 2014, workshops mobile recording studios direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop puts the young participation in discussions on topics such as cultural identity, language, struggles, love, self acceptance, "or what to give them always in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winblazago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia says, for example, the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway from tears," on which almost two dozens mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="718">One can see almost any kind of plastic dishes in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are displayed in the vicinity of the entry of shokuhin sanpuru (showing that of the "plastic models of dishes") is exhibited by each food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or proceed to the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district, there are a multitude of these small enterprises that produce those plastic dishes created by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese those plastic dishes are so usual that they don't have to know them any more. a new trend, however, turned out today in a conspicuous phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin-purple.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic grated mobile phone bands that are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu purchase department.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitten, such as in this case, cooling cabinet magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shochin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essments is increasingly being faced.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) is turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a Apple, holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, using a notch for mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, any popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anybody who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can't shoot my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only thing.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes may also accept a less appetite form to surprise for example of colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the form of melting the ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">Also, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can view more skurrile plastic items you can view it at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # 1, giving up the same thing.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media about the notorious "struggle against drug trafficking," in Mexico, the missiest and killed regularly appeared in statistics. however, this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this fight conspends.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa square, urged the stories of conflict in the background completely.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, barely someone looking at the grief or communities that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each strip, behind every bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves, stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds are perhaps to cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican News Portal Animal PolÃ­tico is called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking,") which is supposed to give these victims a voice and stories from people who were in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes this project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organisational crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are many profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops will close because they are threatened by drug traders and will need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" "" "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fearing life") tells exactly these stories. "" "</seg>

<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost their father's four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "like every Sunday, we are preparing to let's go back to the task that we have put off and go to graves, according to the people who we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should return again, but he never returned. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You will go to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay it out because they demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show faces the faces that are afraid. we must show the international community of conflicts to show fragility and the state of state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader made by Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Africa.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us of what violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and sensory journalism now since some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day at newspaper tilting and see the cover pages with pictures that actually are from a textbook for criminology or from specialists can come from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the one, the dead or sad. it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be the same or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It further writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year-old cousin think that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is large. and it's not normal that people listen to the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, this is what they inherited the ones who have lost someone and those who have fear them also something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories will be naked figures in a statistic only.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatennia of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearances are justified by 43 students in a neighboring village that they have been living. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to agree that they are spared from such tragedies while they are not agitate and still silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months Erpressung in the Capital district." it describes how an armed crime was spoiled for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely essential.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want that the others are arrested, because they don't know when they will be taken or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, if wine would have a deep roots to dissolve feelings, but the answer is no, for I have forgotten what you weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he puts questions on how, who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he himself had to bring himself to himself as one egg grains, potatoes broth and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for all year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable to a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and the learning to live with that.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody Lyche of his father, who had been shot by armed men from one of the driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was born:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence organised by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world, due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecution counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8,5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">This are only some hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrating the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of a new headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" is called Animal Journalism project, which consists of complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has peeled the country in the past four decades to present in a intelligible manner.</seg>

<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before they flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned in streets and prayers.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained to count to count," "" "said a resident on Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were tender, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from the basis of satellite images, the following period could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained uncertain, but the army base in Baghdad was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Kongo on again when it appears as proof of the fact and the possible degree of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took place in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image has been interpreted as a cover to the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages that were connected with it were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) to go through these Posts. the first frame focuses on Religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in regards to major discussions about silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing has been used to discuss how an African life is evaluated by comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">They understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens if readers can't give these images anymore.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are eighty people who have unintentional that water round about a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this mood of malicious and falsehood, that the actual atrocities did not true and decorates the real grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The prevalence of forcible pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that the forcible pictures have readers and spectators and to give them the ability to empathy empathy (such as those trial, that seem to effect as forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">During a lot to discuss representations in the news media, fact, fact that it is indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against "Fake News". they are thoroughly based on the situation in which a picture can be applied completely from the context or completely abusive species.</seg>

<seg id="946">Some of these unacceptable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish braking).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubborned at any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>

<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - BemÃ¼h for your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>

<seg id="955">In Birds's words from his blog about:</seg>

<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practiced our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, on different art. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims who don't fit there to be muscles there.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad was up to the day that he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western idea, the religion was deleted by Rumis, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion represents a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the inductive images of Muslims, which already colonise Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting language is determined by the dark man that should fear and the exotic woman whom you should save.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry, and Hollywood they continued to keep it.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful, faulty Narrative our newsfeeds dominate.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narrativ overshadowes the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries during the United States during the US in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrativ fail to recognise that if French, Muslim women are forced to take on her head cloth in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabia in public buildings to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same medal.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group practises his "control" on the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narratively weakens Muslim women who perform movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afrikaners, that were brought to slave ships with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This Narrativ has realized our collective pre-creation force of art and defective, that often Sikh men and children are often used for antistatic attacks and chications.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, we tell us and because of the nature, in which we tell it, is Islamophobia today not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We are also creating Narrative, who help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to capture the Narrativ of the 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we are failed to raise the seven million Muslims who make up the highest degree "religious group in America in the highest degree."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way, here and now, despite a language barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the "Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the stories of stories in their original language a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a brief initiative by Steven Bird, the incredible blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but in the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and to dignity.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Actually, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">Mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we create cities, accepting diversitÃ¤t - safe spaces that are not forgotten in those inhabitants are to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to" "" "listen to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "to listen to appreciate that link." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format a storyteller will initially set their history first in their own language and translate or declare them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional master's count, their commitment and their representation is that the audiences can be enshrined on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call for laughing and emotions, than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, history collection of Rassidatou contestates also the opportunity to clarify the country's typical customs of exploration.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fabel of the bunny and the avian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the meaning of his fak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to an audience, that your language does not understand?" with a broad grin, he divides his feeling of the vision:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and organisers are hoping to expand this. all those who have inspired by the project can organize a TLS in contact with TLS.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian National developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing a year since more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, he continued his supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference on digital culture that is held in Berlin, devoted itself to a event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of France's resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, director of book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, lases from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Invoice (The Cost of Freedom: a collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is licensed under license, contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to show how movements for frees know and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in movements for frees knowledge, have worked on page to page about the nebulae which find our newsfeeds and create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the loved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was yesterday's name of the Adra prison, where he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then requested no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title colleague Remembrance his friends and his family, who want to access his release, and who want to know him back in his ordinary lives and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, has many of us to start thinking about their own destinies, works and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given in this process of time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist has been published by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra-jail, a non-military installation, transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who had promoted themselves as an insider of the Assad government and made them an alleged death against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His dwelling place and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, played a crucial role in the Internet, providing access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently superseded the director of the New Palmyra, a project which founded the Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was no one of Bassano's cultural prototypes as the work which he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilians and merging greek-Roman architectural models with hiessplant traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS had everything to put everything that architecture does not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysrians but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This shift in the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be given to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The project has not yet been able to shut up this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of liberty and teaching me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I have overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English to me, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge of each shared who asked him. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other inmates how to use computers, at least theoretically without that they actually stopped one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a Promissal, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was living in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together with the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They ginged the lyrics, when they visited him, and translated them out of the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1229">That I will sing in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers has no matter,</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the Regime of Bashar al-Assets, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (syrisking network for human rights) have disappeared for more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under separation of the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many others are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been on the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat today our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: in case of corruption in detention, Mosambique was re-provisional to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambiana responded with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, at which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is where Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010, together with four other defendants due to adverse effects of 54 million Metikal.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza took place between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good guide and immediately called his re-setting into the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluates the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza, again, as the company passed away no discipline to its imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many people don't want the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution which sets itself for public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company, to address the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a return in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what knowledge is to know, that the company should also have a disciplining process against the irresistors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, no adequate legal steps for the application of relevant functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behaviour also starting and considered the case as "rebellious":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would have been a competent type, he would be consultants when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which he had to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid lectures and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, it is illicited to reintegrate into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil says, the director no mural:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he did not believe him, I can't believe anyone who had so massively mature in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals and serve the state, * he had already been serving a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead himself served by the State.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was using the state, when it has been used to get an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of this man that was uploaded and finally sentenced to long term imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to recall the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel to recall that a thief has heard in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Mahel the Mozambique is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, slitting and - right by - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of its most famous oral representations, when it was energetically confirmed that "an ambitious person is capable of being able to sell his own individual interest, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said likewise, "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but it does not turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a criminal criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmesan word "Kalar pae" means cchickpeas or aging lens.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information by Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Networks took their postal from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussing the source of the word, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian source or generally used as adjective "Insight."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censored the word "Kalar" or "(in burial Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hassusion in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the past few years, the rise of radical National movements of the word has given an extreme poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly of ultra-nationalists are used as hate crimes against Muslims who represent a minority in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the efforts to fight them in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual contents on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word at itself calls not automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that they also discussed the use of the word or in doubt for the purpose of his use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmesan words with basic differences, which have the same accounting pattern like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(Spaging bse),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocrack Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he asked his friends in spiritually, whether they could wake up his back pain as he made a vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence Ku la - "Healing" (Ku) + the Questioner (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hs is the opinion that they will decrease in Hassce radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook could be analytical, before it solder all the Posts to spread racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation is not understood what you are to do on them.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, check the post carefully and check it by reading the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(aged bold).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three nationalist nationalists wanders them to spread a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a powerful signal to all them, hate, even the efficiency of this strategy may not stick long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat showed that the censorship of drums are often associated with a cat and mouse game where users can simply start social networks, a new word or an alternative writing of the zenry word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described, like Facebook started to delete his friends when he wanted to make his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post of Facebook was removed from Facebook and given me the liken, post and share of content for 24 hours because the post "Facebook Community standards are not unexplained."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards away, which have no negative intentions or just try to show their opinions against them speaking radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with them:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassle from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the Post, the author divided his opinion about how extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are poorly damaged in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more than would do more Facebook before the beginning of the initiative, for example:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook wants a well-looking intent to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">A lot of words to zenegs will be made even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems that if they have started this without local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "Patrisencurry" have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they had done mistake, they didn't tried to put them correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If it has only been a bit more respect for the 15 million benefit, which would have a major sales that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided for a lot of spiracy among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users are now funny as Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posters are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts that had no hate speech, but still have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmmesan text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch a heat curry and watch a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try if Facebook contains the post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and its influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">In other things, the tongue in social networks should also heat the violence in Myanmar in addition, especially in Rakhine territory, where the Muslims between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to flee to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his conviction, they criticised themselves on his Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply wants to zenry the word 'Kalar', it would have been better in context than concentrating on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's Statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, who endeaved to abolish laws to pediatrie, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">One Hindu-leader, for instance, had no concerns to say the criticism of the children's before, they should be condemned to worry about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition looked for tension in this virtually uncomplicated thing, and sometime worried doubt whether the opposition would be in the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children toe was decided - despite 4 transformers (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent which contained in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must vote and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the transformers of the country gave a Status update which has again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the child before was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously decided in the Senate, the draft plan can now be made to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users have been impressed because the laws have been changed to children's before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has a lot of time and unnecessary Gerede, which has devoured the core of the thing, but do you know what? the child's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was my opinion it was definitely enough to finish his practice, Lara Quescape all-Thomas was delighted that the day finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folding Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil group that talked quite openly about how important the passage of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the amendment to the Ehegesetzes Act was today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives, there are 41 deputies and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were opposed to law have approved for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The child before is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childbearing childjudge.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have laid it out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations to your cart.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Thank to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj declared his intention to join the judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a supporter of Law, said it was absolutely legitimately when Maharaj was going to act against the law, the most social media users wished, one would take the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we can say, instead of the debate in general, in a way that we invite, to say the state into our bedroom, simply target to say the state into our bedroom, that they may be abused by large, hard-backed males who may be abused against them in the advantage, "would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it is a judicial proceedings against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are legally legal or still the norm, although there are laws that they teach them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English language page was reported on 18 January 2012, against the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyrights legislation in the USA, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month now, Turkey closed the popular and popular encyclopedia Wikipedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for Tag it is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans of TV series watches against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicians of Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (an current article published by the New York Times) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world, the most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been shut up in 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently as recently published in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society has been adopted at Harvard University, you will find regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most important country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrorpages (pages, mirrored the contents of Wikipedia and frequently).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform disposed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (which hosts machine computers) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost report IPFS on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we used it all to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read contents on decentralized and distributed others.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if you can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was independently conducted by the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only concerns screenshots and a live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli von Wikimedia Italy, has both tramvikiansiknock, a Mirror from Wikipedia, as well as the Mirror, an open source project that everyone can use with similar mirrorsides, when used in the respective country Wikipedia, is brought forth.</seg>

<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You can get to another URL which is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sar was trying to bring Neptune's wildlife on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home-home right next to Chitwan National Park, giving him the perfect opportunity to shoot a photos that direct the attention of Nepals fauna.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described this on Facebook, how this superb location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just arrived at home, when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father to be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed it and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to get pictures to Knipsen!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">SLC is aiming to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals Nature and would like to understand the understanding of understanding that wild animals are not so furious as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood already with his face to face,</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sins placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take pictures in Bardia National Park shots of Otters. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the Tourist Office.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published as part of a Content-Sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, the names of their husbands or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a ponomen or tell "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chartisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the standard to preserve this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Oosta by a headcourt and spurred by her family and the village community, after being addressed a relying relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not names to name, is also common among men. however, they are far from less assignments to fear if they don't know this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health care as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main speckled topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the hostesses of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelp Badal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is set up for degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pac has been working with the help of her videocamera on the discovery of practices, such as children's homes up to the ban of HIV- and AIDS-infected people, and conducts these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini shown in their discussion, traded women who didn't call their husbands during the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to decide on this subject, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands would not be imituted according to their husbands, it is also a custom in which they have been found in commitments and never put into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini comments:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testify that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't holding this, is considered a list, considered a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made our discussions on this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to test her husband, so far at the name of the name, tried to try out at home just as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion lap of her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband were still long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me and said that I should name it from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion in their luggage with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" nor never before. some believed that there was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, the women tried to bringing the discussion with practice in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, offend, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can name us as they want, means that they must not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini "" "" of the village of Walhe in Maharashra over the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never had to speak the name of their husbands. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just before themselves sick; a second decided to leave the whole frustration against him and leave his family by destroying him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even at the adrenalinrst about that, with an ancient broth, the women decided that they would actually try to call her husbands during the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini got a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head: his wife could not stop his name to say.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another cluber decided to do it when dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in mother murdered them, she was afraid, and said that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Raw ini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the carcinoma size of the cinoma size at the forehead, which shows the commentstatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry out the gnored dot if he had it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely discounted, but mine, they are now in a better position, even to choose it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip in every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunches and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to make sure that the women might make what could hear" "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never made thoughts before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have worked on some things, for example, as our identity are tied to our husbands, never frank so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things say noisy, no matter how small she happened.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group had been married to Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay but some wanted to bear a Salad-Kurta, a far shirt above a trousers; they did not tarred.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own hanger, the morals connected to the Saris and much more, Dugginger her own pairs of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion has been changed, Rohini confirms that things slowly get into rollers:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done just small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then heard again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it still, but only when they are alone and there are not any other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry now at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women at the discussion group know that they would like to reach them in their lives - like the arrow to access more freedom of movement or the own coat hers - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving of each other self-confidence, them will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw is explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is each of us the confidence that it will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman is in the club home, and other people are reported about what we're talking and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from outfrontier groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid as Singapore is recognized by the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be regarded as a town in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This statement has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister informed that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, in order to compare Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underscore that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has changed in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offerings, this valuable land is to create, you can say that we finally be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the shine of a escape before the responsibilities, a compulsory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if thou art not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very Nobel ers: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'ordinary countries', in view of whose, he was insoftened.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore has to be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which become permanent by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old glers from the authorized rulers take up the democrats introduced to be better, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his US guests regarding our press, our joyful, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant questions could be ratically rational with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to clear his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our wered K Shanmugam would take on the trouble to clarify this point, if it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on his commentary on his comment, referring to the reviews you should begin to read the entire address of the conference so that you could understand the context of the declaration of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he declared why the elections in Singapore gets so unparalleled, even if we are looking forward to free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He likened to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of those cities saw the party a party of decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "isn't a country," "" "he obviously did not show it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment via Shanmugam, which makes it as leader one of the growing generation, such as polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what said the Minister of Justice of Singapore,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which expected me to agree with them, or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes, and is aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review sushes the weak spots of Shanmugam Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "did an error, or was it a Freudscher person?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country is the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people work their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Finally, the journal Journey of a Decade for the year, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set appears to be more popular than that of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear about" "" "the defense of the country especially" "", "but that's not true." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak for the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as a part of a continuing array, with rumours about certain parts of the world and a different facet will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is preferred to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I am coming from Canada." "" "I'm coming from Canada." "" "I live in Japan since 1994." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation that takes place in the discussion, it is considered polite to show interest in his talk partner by providing personal issues.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"" "on my clarification then follow the standard answer:" "" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." "" "there are a lot of Canadian, if they are kept for Americans, but not bothered me." ""</seg>
<seg id="1746">For somebody who doesn't know it is little bit different from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadian player buys a Canadian flag clearly visible on her backpack, when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans are....</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was even when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Kanadians have always borne small aphorals in their baggage to distinguish themselves from her American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">The same sex marriages are legally established in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We are obviously very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposedly regarded as the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admired a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Nothing would make me nothing if one would switch to Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there is also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "cute" is to be referred to as "cute," says to be a diligent to be as the benign, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders of "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian doubles).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" does not have a personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, is inconspicuous and very interesting to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you stay unnoticed in the background, from the things you pass around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire is free and alone to be a principal member of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What riverbose than "nice" can be labelled, is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian people don't talk about the fence away with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Us lacks the warm warm, open kindness, which I have connected with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadian is more than just "cute." our prime minister has made Canada almost too sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular, how to keep it with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at this video recordings that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand continued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" might possibly refer to the draconical section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which the upper-commanding of the army's absolute decision grants an important national topics.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migraine, which cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula and is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a cordial diamond frame and golden earring in teddy bÃ¤ren.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born there in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal of Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 Dollar / night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, brushed walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haitian migrant come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez, tells the people in full small bushes and from the top part of the coast to call them: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but in this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She desires to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when she is sick, they buys their medicines that they can not pay, they massage them with a balm one of the long journey exhaustive strings.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable top name for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, which has a joystick #) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes," "" "he answered them with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits to her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston for his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are in the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then moving towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other signposts of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest of Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">It tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel together the route and that the Africans are talking to WhatsApp from Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his position, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building staff for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," says he smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that her guests will send her often textbooks when they are gone to greet them or to report on their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explain that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps well known here but it is not the only funky hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul-asse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family have entered into their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the Busterets have been sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings in the ground but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells me. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before men who wanted to make money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a Unknown, a single attraction, has offered her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and trying to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corners they consult their telephones quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but it also nostalgically, because of those who go away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she blended in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairdryers which has made a customer, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while they briefly presented me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se Criteron," repeats them every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices to Xinjang from Twitter users, that...</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cellphone user in the Tianshan District of the city Urumqi received a mobile notification where it indicates the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the notification it is said that the" "" "app" "" "will have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">Nevertheless, the authorities can use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh Women in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture were arrested because they had been installed shortly after they had exchanged the app. News with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks, and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwast website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system-categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, by online fraud, Troians and Phishing-Pages to make users to make sure how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with the filters for minors is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in a variety of course.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" state actors or even hacking could trigger the home network of a person to manipulate or steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications on digital censorship in China is mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the East and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, ethnic minority interests like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures, as well as routinely Internet alterations.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-outlet-outlet "images from the China" (showing that of this happening), the zensierte news in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint where policemen visited the occupants if they had installed monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of the captivity through the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the Republic of China" (the same thing) published a Jingwang product description from which the software is able to raise the password needs of a Windows operating system to receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and cellphones are located in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang might possibly create a reaction to the statements of the city council, to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities, and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions for the Cybersecurity office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, a US-American Convention on Human Rights, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, authorities released the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, cellphones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards in the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos"; however, this promotion violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole range of other things, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2059">I don't answered.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I was accustomed to answer me, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't even say anything to say when insulators and mud will become a friendly interview for me in ordinary communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and what happened, was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to accusted me if I had to be punished, even though I had done nothing to make this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">To sentence in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to rip me so much flesh as possible by the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionately "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the cloths.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker puts it at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give it pleasure to him, you can not measure you with him, and you cannot stop your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry were not enough, why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had been working as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in one another, in order to present the great invention of a giant cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them are changed, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice, why I ceased to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noticed the cooling and took no delight in it, so it was the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through the whole body, enough to supply my whole area.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-bare body, which lay out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The divorness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two horrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for the night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must have been so around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lay down my sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed away that came to me like minutes ago.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door open itself and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I am answering with the voice of one exhausted young people:" "" "my lord, my father must become fearful worried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet, and go you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The jordan Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoking a cigar in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; once he shuffled to his screen, sometimes on his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on, there is a cigar between his fingers or his companions to be discovered with nicotine moldy lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top level of his family house which had been one of them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as fellows (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist that the conservative majority has turned over against gender, sexual activity and free expression of opinion through art and rapist.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the whole Arab world. all these issues are not only allowed in his home town of Amman relevance, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria until the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking, and he can feel with their own statement regarding the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it is not open, he overthrew against the US foreign policy, a special ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, something to do with his identity as "Palestinian Poems of the second generation," he himself describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life," stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then add it: "I think it was, because I am a man, while in the water soluble NescafÃ© in two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that period it is intended for Muslims who fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain brooks to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senatively called Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">They generally speak a warm coffee and the waisting of Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan was like a prison under the free sky, above all when taking a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Thus, it avoids that it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to avoid not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior of the Jordanian country has canceled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians that support the Islamic Across front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front man Hamed Sinno, contradicated to the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokesperson of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub told in an interview with CNN that the concert "had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many asserts that the band's commitment to matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that provides the old proven legitimacy's regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the jordan people as "progressive supporters of Human Rights," which continued to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be senriched rhetoric, but actually a distinct evident reality reflected in Jordan, which appears in Hdaibs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib resigned a traditional gender perspective by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women that have voreheliy sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown woman, whose arms and legs descends up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them that they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of "Honmoratorium '- the unofficial exterior.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch reportedly reached its zenith in 2016; however, it is added that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support women, the victims of murder or domestic violence to support appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law, in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of infamilial violence, "to uncertain time in prison," and for its release is often a long-bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music is very popular with great popularity and it is known to revert well ahead of topics covered in his country as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib contests that his work is politically, however, he recognizes his music that is full of exponite attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, husband.</seg>
<seg id="2125">My policy has been decided to me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib takes the question according to the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is a focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs written in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other's it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, "that is what you want" - is faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that no one speaks in Jordan over the rights of vibrations and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were even censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview on the popular German Onlineanic Onlineage programme, in order to realize that his comments were torn out of the context, and in his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a revised version," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance opposed to homosexuals did not talk to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">It mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks, if Abu Nuvo, who should work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century could be open to homosexuality, why does Jordanian aren't able to do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled due to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Haschemian kingdom there is no new thing that the government attacks against the free expression of opinion and that progressive voices can be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan News Service adopted several former government agencies and members of the teaching area, with the grounds, they had expressed themselves on comments in social media, which led to the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of whose, the concert Hdaibs is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of Jordanian.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him is progress a permanent call. Mashrou'Leila is now a concert for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it is made of slow, deliberate and insignificant changes. it is certain that these changes take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, dreamaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreaming not only of them to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience her. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will assume the help of music, art and literature of a real and basic offence - and not by bombs, streumitions and artificial art conducted democracies. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Even so far, Hdaib will resorded and thus also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which is part of the Student Fellow as Student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant war props are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. a further theory states that the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been delivered and from a period of time, in the army's native to the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, which emit to force the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have a look at Meguro Gajoen for long time: two fixed cars are currently visible.</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for men's services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyle of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressing who can imitate the hairstyle hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The exceptional demand for hairstyle, which go to the ultimate borders of fantasy and creativity has even been inspired by an annual event that has been taking part in the hairdresser's "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been held since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to Guerillusionists</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalvo.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "Liebesmessenger to Guerillusionists," published an international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important, people who feel emitting, affection for something?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question came to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), giving young people to write guerilliterate letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace agreement with the Guerillabees FARC (German: revolutionary forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International became the signatories to the peace agreement as important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before Columbus, however, there is a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to a war rhetoric, and around the clock had contributed their weapons. they have to integrate them into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, has to record them in their ranks, and support them with the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnans have to join themselves and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And they did exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guerrilla, to call them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The objective of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former Guerillusionists - who will then be handed to personally personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureate, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there had Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "this explained that we love the people who love thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need to need a lot more needful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told us to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent matters.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan to write a letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war with a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Previously, more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Caldono region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation BogotArt in the camp to translate the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC appeared as they had previously done to counteraccept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters in protecting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all participants. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that is between," telling the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governors of the Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a type of hut in which the guerillusionists live), I saw a guerrilla person who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because in addition to him there was a MGL-Pomer, a deadly weapon in the village of the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never ever written in my life, that is why I answered it. "since I suddenly had my tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I moved him quite quickly, and set me beside the Pomena.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I felt sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this damsel, and wanted to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more than his life. he never had something different from life as war. the FARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger. "I never thought that someone might be forgiven me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Till now I have learned what I had to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is over, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and several leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as a war and ended the FARC already in secret places.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into her views on the peace process. "for many years, we have experienced how to develop our social injustice on the whole of the Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the company in that country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of these magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people listen to so far had never found their hearing and no electoral law, and to recognize that people who have been often seen as Monster and even hate, even people with nice feelings that were turned out by their habits and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth, in which the land lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But I comfort me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bite, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of Cali the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was prophesied that after destructive peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take care of weapons and protest to their rights. this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology are angled - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our post and bring sacrifices, because we know from own experience, that nothing is easy. denamong us who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties shall be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way we will give it a lot of obstacles, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which medical wings were you laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete since my male name is up; but the doctor stand and laid me on women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this reason I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his offices, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, an Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he has gone respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote me - relatives, and some perfect disobedience.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to send me to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They issued absurd claims: some said to me that I had to prove it without passing through the streets; others said that I had not changed in the official TV in Grozny, and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only flawful, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tries to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They brought a monster to the world, that has not just your family, but the whole republic has damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to vanish from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much, and she turned a snap around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully, the neighbours and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved in an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a plate of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it was clear that there was a lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights show reviews the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to phone my mom as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without having to register without interruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I set the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe it, you warmest in safety, only because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel du plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about sex. however, this is a tabletopic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some of the Caucasian elements are always in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish I could not overcome this seelian barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I will actually give me about how the person is watching some of her past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who are dordoned?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington for last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">I needed to find current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who underwent a one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan he was arrested and tortured, but also that all the Ramadan Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">This means that I would like to invite their relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof of that the so-called "glory" of blood from blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are they still recorded in these secret results?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it wasn't really many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "when, before all those who have no family, or have left their relatives in order to set up the Kadyrows of trial." ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be imprisoned there so that they can present they later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be brought to show her body in television and claim that they had attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submered to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I taught someone who was imprisoned in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was carried away even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not introduced into bandits, but there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could I not allowed this people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and demonstrations of people who are part of a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I lived there - and I had never encountered problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to the "Civil Procedure," but ultimately dropped into the stone times.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were bent; I had coloured eyelashes, carried tube jeans and short tofu.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially in weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never revived.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda Kharda. that means: "mock not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children, if they are fun with sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes closed from you because they believed they are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never stopped me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow took on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us per se, but also about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - they could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who was borrowed before, laughed at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I won't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still worked as activists.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicable with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teetting, gathering, I join them to hospital and help them to get eating cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I leave no cents for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered this people itself, when I was hiding refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's althiest.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, which would like to do with foam before the mouth that there is no gay at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The daemans who have the Cabardiner, who have the Russians also have; but on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practised Muslims who go into the mosque, and fasten them in the Ramadan fasten - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transidental in men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a Trugator.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feelings to be exact, different habit settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I am here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warned in front of an increase of self-moral within the armed Arabian Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz Region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty-rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of self-moral.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with approval.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, marked by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under attack residues, depression, and relates himself for his own help to come up for his family, so Ahwazi-Human Rights groups that work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had already kindled itself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to delete the flames again, and moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">Local sources according to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide in August that occurred within the Arab Ahwazi minority in August, and activist before the site that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights found that several other - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: there were all family vans who felt on persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and inable to do their families and maintain their safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment, and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is based on a large majority of Iran living in the Arabian Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab Ahwaz was an autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">There are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the Awaz region and some of the richest and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to remain slow, and the local population receives only little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illness, hunger and kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi Arabs systematically systematic jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of demons that are water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are in the way.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation in the region by dry destruction, and local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who have completed a job, finished in primary school, 55% a secondary school completed and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Kenimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activists in London, talked to Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self-moral among the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment is more serious. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic people and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Functional and Institutions do not use Arab working forces, the local Arabian Ahwazi is leaving the access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">That is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of National Resistance of young Arabs and forced them to make their living halt outside of their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their name and surname, to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even as the Arab name will not be tolerated at the workplace, soften as the speaking of Arabic language or Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which must endure the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activates the human rights, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world rising up and it's knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treated with perpetual depression and is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why don't I identifiable to identifiably with the feminism, also with the intersectionality"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement that was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions were published.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, some women - especially white women, who draw itself as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You even have a well thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite the same formation than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent demands when it comes to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still affecting that women were sojourned or later in various areas of life at a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still perverse through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is deliberately and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced of it and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to contact skin, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or in black women from the Diaspora; if I have been used, on what kind of bodily, seelian and verbal abused, many white feminists, and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women should come together to sing "their voices and" Kumbaya, my lord 'to sing "to reach equality (some) of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, a separate form of motivated violence that we are exposed to a choice of black women.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women other Ethnic and country of origin less deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background more often the school are referenced as a white girl, due to obvious integrity issues.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spinach and women with a migration background to higher risk are exposed to domestic violence, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand I want to have all the women, all men and all men of any kind in the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join me as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman is refuses to take into account that both of the sex as well as the skin colour of one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and won no more about my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere-oriented sphere, who always rejected me and countless other black women forever.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, in her speech: "am I no woman?" and I also walled me to justify a ideology in which the black woman in a historical regard is a human and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I like to join me in groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural approach to propel their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to draw white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender. because some of them still try the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to recover it a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give wives from different origins a home and to rences from white Feminism, is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I take it before me to resolve me full and all of feminism, which was established for my dark skin and my status as a woman's life, rather than me for a white feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that Intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">It is more important than ever before we have to define black women to our own performances and give us into the sphere, which are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson Weems, author of the book Africana Dananism: as we ourselves can defend us, in which they can defend us, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, seagic, physical and even the spiritual elements can be rejected, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called Separatism and Exclusion, after they read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment, in which my life neither passed, nor ignored, is still denied.</seg>

<seg id="2467">This post by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports insignificant over international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">In the context of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Once again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq last 7 years - usually with surf board or in canoe - with a special concerns through the region Kurdistan, Iraq. its mission is aimed to realize people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of contamination to its church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river which we lost as I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dust, pollution, and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate watercrisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - that works to protect the rivers, streams and water paths in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarises the idea and importance of his work in a question: "if we would not have any more water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and released for Ensia von Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaking documentary filmmaker and multi-medial journalism in Erbil.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The emphasis of their work is followed, little respecting subcultures and distinguishes itself by using cooperating video photography and new multimedia techniques, with their help of exploited municipalities, tell their stories on their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by cturf. the article belongs to the number # PorserMujer (# weilichefraul) that is reported about women in Paraguay against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, its exclusive partner who had become an old partner.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship has been some time, and the police said, their statement would not be turned to the files, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further wife Balbuena was indicated for mistreatment, also the acute display of Ada BÃ¡ez was used.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved its ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The famine of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women seem to be advertised at all, they generally get no support on the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also are financially dependent on men who abuse they. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be found at all in the prosecutions authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Includes and Statistical 2 Unvisible abuse and legal system, which is nothing undergraduate of the Islamic laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to define how many women are really harassed, MyÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gendery on the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that however, not even ansatary to demonstrate the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Attorney General of 9600 ads passed by domestic violence. 70% of them went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">More than 5000 ads were given for domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically motivated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show, however, not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan female Secretary of Ana Baiardi, only a few of these offenders are actually indicated. "on every woman who are not refundable in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman who are reimbursed because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this, "she declared end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay, no criminal offences can not be reasonably documented, as many women are murdered every year by its current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 there were at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered in their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and legal system that doesn't undertake nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning it didn't want to do so, but now she should repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years since the psychic violence on the other side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time clearly recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I thought that only women happens to be subcontracted by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his charges and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, among them also Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch whether he ever lifted up his hand against them and refused to be a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen this so long from Carlos and had not left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that sacrifice of abuse at least a certain creditor would have had.</seg>
<seg id="2516">In Paraguay, Victoria Santos, who was not out of Paraguay, fought in Paraguay with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partners joined them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do that, as many others do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Your prosperous partner managed to convince them to convince her.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias View to the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives, she did not received any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It carried out a process against their former partners, who developed into an unicable judicial war between Paraguay and its home country, in which it mainly went about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, defective implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good, but not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of mistreatment is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems with the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill of law was discussed under the hashtag # PorAlsace (# intercession).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-bricks) are part of a campaign that supports Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The bill of the bill proposes to explain Female-d to a autonomous penalties, as already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature has changed in some points, in order to destroy the MPs to the law, that the way for the decriminalization of abortions would be banned, which currently in Paraguay are generally prohibited and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original Bill had provided the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) tax, which currently has to bear the victims of violence, if they simply want to create an ad placement and to lay a safe place to establish the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law should not be effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources available:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here you have to think that violence is no longer regarded as a little standard.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever truthinks in the presence of these facts is thisted and helps to get the perpetrators of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must allow for such a long time permit until mistreatment does not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed. among others a passage was cancelled, which the partners enacted in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor, to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," political force, "and" sexual harassment "of the law, however, is considered a great retreat.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by cturf. the article belongs to the number # PorserMujer (# weilichefraul) that reported about women's conscience in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most names were changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Independent Media in Oman has further exposed a year after the ban of a newspaper</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website has been closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information" is read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Azamn, because of its coverage over corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he is banned a year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power since 1970, after he had deposed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state theatre.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces, especially the domestic confidentiality, public liberties, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, advocate and incarded.</seg>
<seg id="2553">Authorities of peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically systematic and hinds citizens, also activists, to express their views over the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and detention, three of their editors last year, is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was prohibited by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, having appeared in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, with the title "Hochranean parties to bind the hands of Justice". this was corruption by the judicial authorities and the mixture of high-level civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having judges the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in a inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zahir Al-Abri, a member of the Editorial Committee, was charged at the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS drew the Deputy Editor of the editor of Yousef Al-Haj to act as cheerful editor to Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed at uncertain time after the information Minister had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way, including online, prohibited from 9th August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial was held in Maskat the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were condemned both amongst others due to disturbance of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "excavation of the state".</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of an audience and found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of fines in the amount of 3000 omic Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found entitled "an information network for spreading material that could pose a danger for the public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">A damage deposit of 5000 omic Rial (13 000 US dollars) was fixed on 22 August 2016, and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016, the Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri, but sentenced to six months in prison to Al-Haj, and sentenced to six months imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 in jail for a six-month prison sentence from the central prison sentence of Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison, where he is banned his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition, the Court of Appeal adopted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court, Azamn retread, the newspaper looks like attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information also signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and the Minister of Appeal dismissed another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to resign the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in Oman at recent time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, the closure of the Website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country to set its operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continued closing of Azamn and the imprisonment of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to an extensive injury of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the Iranian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj moved and unconditional;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists may follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the press freedom in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances that human rights being defective and journalists in Oman has taken their legal human rights, unhindered and without fear of profiling, including judicial kicans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not even mentioned. this is a growing area that is addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of performing medical research, there are two reasons for a lack of the global health sector, covering many medicines and vaccines that cover the special needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is conducted by African scientists itself is helping to develop its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth in the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for exploring infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he studied at HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of media over this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier says as private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment my focus is on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) using laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just starved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what are your opinion according to the important recent scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always stay the receiver, instead of yourself Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not used in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are well funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's hard to find people who come back or come here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the fundamental infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs lots of money, a continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should focus on it, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special scientific training starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, researching of space, health (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are greatly benefiting.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do, and the resulting access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the U.S. to India: how "Open Source" seed producers are global food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solvents for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding with Frank Morton since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been embellished.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only possible due to its own expirons and the question as many sorts of sorts can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that even more salads were patented, so that he could not be able to breeding them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual types but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or contruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereal or boxes originals. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts take care of food security around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still needs Salad, but he needs more, since his work is becoming increasingly difficult because of his work.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is when I have a rock in a river, where I must paddling it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents go in salads too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before court, no one can breed a new salads, because all features are patented. "he makes so good as possible and trying to figure out those characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have cultivated red Romans salat of the variety Outredder in the "greenhouse" building, "which is cultivated and eaten. it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as sounds as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) is inspiring by the movement for free "Open Source" software, alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and genic are not being protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, just Ossi, US breeders could also commit that others can freely use the seeds being able to freely use seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This, however, does not mean that they can do not do business with their seed and can sell it. "open source" breeders for only others to breeding their seed, and it is not immediately forged - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of dozens and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Economic prospects for prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breeding new plants, especially important for food security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays to him a role in major merge such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to take the latter not or just as little as they cultivated plants with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not to buy our goal of ecological agriculture, the most recent examples of mercies in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples is to buy, locally, locally and sustainably reproducible vegetables, such as the species is offered on farms, also ought to know how that vegetables are bred, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereigity without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make others their seed remains free of charge. that is, in contrast, seed and plant features are to be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supporters ensure that the future of food supply is at risk since the available gene pool due to the always abundant intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always restricted to inflow.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all Karting features are protected as intellectual property, making it either not used for plant breeders at either no or less.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are still not, but experts like Luby avoided plants like wheat in the larger style were patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted features - from such that their taste or its color improves up to such that thrives them in certain environments, and threats driving diseases such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents upon plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material used to breeders through increasingly more patents. genetic variety is currently more needless than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse than ever before climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto ensure that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for Monsane activities. with a total of four gencies and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States, the company set itself for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">She resisted, however, the view that intellectual property collects other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varietions foster innovation". "a patent is basically taken to be a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection thus inhibits innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait until a patent process, and surely make no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time to breeders plants that are adapted to the amended environmental conditions, the fight had already lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources should always have been a general practitioner and there should be still remains: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetting incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is due to the concept of making plant features: "we are not really creating the characteristics itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we ultimately didn't know how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder, plant in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who needs a variety, undertaking its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed to cultivate the cultivation of herbicide, breeders into his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just anti. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, the most small seed companies can survive, either if they are either reject or reject it for too expensive and therefore it is not worthwhile too, or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant-patented innovative would: "it looks like that I am dealing with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors may sell my varieties within a few years, "says he." with a patent man is being protected from competition for 20 years, so how to make it very nice. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Though the U.S. seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" cattery, the concept spreads very quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes themselves as a professional organization in the area of resources. to preserve the seed of traditional farm crops, the center together with farmers and helps them to breeding new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreements works on an "Open Source" license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding they differ from country to country, absent not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally-cultivated plants should not be patented. thus it speaks for the present practice of the European Patent Office, the patents in conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a declaration is not yet a law; now it is to carry out the governments of the Member States to carry out this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference entitled "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed companies and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from over East Africa, to learn more about the "Open Source" seed plant movement and the global trend towards the patentability of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" seed systems that the organization is currently constructing a global alliance for "Open Source" seed plant systems for the scheduled next year of official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit-development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group of erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity, to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed-map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essence - a ban from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - publishes a report that farmers have to come to promote and improve seed politics, so that a stable supply can be ensured through food supplies.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In this report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Luby by Ossi hopes that soon more people will be recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly seen, where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are trying to make people clear that more behind her food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still the Egyptian authorities still unlock the contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columniest.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August the Egyptian government shut down the website of the Russian Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities for this step was sharp and promised to continue working and efforts on human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">In spite of this attack, the Network for Human Rights Information Is ignorant despite this attack and the Constitution by the authorities that the law should continue to defend their goal and not so important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical options are exhausted to overcome them and not to admit. we hope to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered as the first censored website of human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities have blocked over two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for congenital "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the wave of the wave trap for victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt's blog and human rights abuses Ahmed Gamal Ziada in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not to reach websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Well, the blog, which he met in order to circumvent the Egyptian government, even aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider at which Ziadas blog is located, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while taking over the student protests and recorded a video about the police, physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly about politics and the human rights issues in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook review, Ziada expressed himself to the blocking through the government and reflecting what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, but even though the blocking of blogs could not seem significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been successful to give me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, a tempter murder, loading in the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I wrote not for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it for the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have closed it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud will go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) closed Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this captivated technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etan alat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers in the conversion of Internet atsur and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June we noticed how to offer the blocking of websites that began VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates that the government's intention to block content and filtering the Egyptian users could have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will be wormated that the decision-makers behind closed doors, thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis for which they can proceed against this actions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization, called Global Justice, called the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are always daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212, at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world such as murder, roughy, sexual intercourse, etc. all that happens by civilised standards and what only happens in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, that we did not close our eyes as journalists in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video which was divided on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of Chief Apostle, declared that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of the failure to be:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war brik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist's newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security, Rio de Janeiro, 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "us is aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, may also be used to leave the atrocities of the police, which only shoot, and then ask any questions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war, based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and their partner is.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalism in CecÃ­lia Oliveira, against violence as "war". this is difficult to justify a justification of failed safety policy by the media and could make it difficult, responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, reconnaissance and a historical and self-pleasing failure of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2781">For these safety-related measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Nacional ficadora), a police unit, founded by the state of Rio in 2003, aims to capture a Favela by using a massive police station and placed a unit permanently there.</seg>

<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page quoted in 2010 by the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux, from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio would not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name of "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of Rio in Rio is also serious consequences for men.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this is calling for the state, means and paths which are typical for war. this is the penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civil war is a silent point in the landscape and an object for "collateral damages" and "irrigated balls."</seg>
