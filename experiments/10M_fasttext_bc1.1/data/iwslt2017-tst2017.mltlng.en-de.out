this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize for the New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before any@@ body had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA list@@ ened illeg@@ ally by Americans .
but it is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence operation , which literally survived the CIA in Iran for a atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not feel the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been determined against rats and promp@@ ted him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , it became a symbol of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and to viol@@ ate journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this law , if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ ch .
so , when the government arrived at rats , he did something what many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ter did before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go to prison .
thus , from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen thus lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something unusual .
suddenly , though they were years old in years that it was indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the claims of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of fail@@ ing and rats to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his in@@ compreh@@ ension , wor@@ ried his phone numbers .
just like its e @-@ mail data , finance and ban@@ ker information , its lending information , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ s .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke to his demands , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary more condem@@ ns any US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that a problem can be , particularly because the government is too many of their work than secret .
since 11 September , almost every article about national security entered the result that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
thus , we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has always has more possibilities to fill out all .
but as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can take it from the moment , in which they contact , rather than in the case , in the testimony .
today , there are communication software that had not existed as rats his book , and it is much saf@@ er than ordinary e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transition system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , as are the Washington Post here .
you can upload documents or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant News Agency has access .
so the government cannot find more information in secret , and many of the information that would like it would not be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments developing all the world will always develop new sp@@ y technologies that end@@ anger ourselves .
it &apos;s to us to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to bring abuse . it is just important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the ab@@ duction of ab@@ normal@@ ities in the supply of soldiers have knowledge and reported of over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for cont@@ empl@@ ated water of fl@@ int . or a Wall @-@ Insider who war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis .
after all these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crime , but to protect against our constitu@@ tional@@ ity .
thank you . thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest database of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that empi@@ res and M@@ Ã¤ch@@ ental &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s &#93; have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; this week we received from news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents shows a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of what customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Muslims Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup it ? &quot;
actually , we will actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already been very direct consequences for the first time .
Iceland prime minister has returned .
there are also reports that a ban of the Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Assad station@@ ed in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is asser@@ ted that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead through a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait the nerv@@ ous to the next publication , and un@@ veil documents .
now all sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems to be removed from you , me , unusual people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that &apos;s all concerned .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases of some few are used to hide and swal@@ low their fortune -- anything that we have been discuss@@ ing and un@@ veil them for ten years .
I think many people will be very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens will work .
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sh@@ ri@@ b .
so one has one company in another company , in another company what makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind this building .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is it .
I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that were present in this dis@@ closure , this sc@@ and@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that you hide your fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle of which tax ha@@ v@@ ens will work , mosqu@@ ito Fon@@ se@@ ca has less US customers .
we would have some data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that one need less information in some US states to get less information to create a company than to get a library identity card .
this type of the in@@ activity in the USA has allowed the employees of school @-@ districts allowed to prevent school children .
it is allowed to have so@@ jour@@ n , especially vulner@@ able off@@ ences .
it is the way of behavior that affects us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a discovered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring dou@@ bling money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked all that up to an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposal , how he could transfer@@ ring his money .
these were all pre@@ school@@ ed . no one of these lawyers participated as a client , and of course no one was given to anyone &apos;s money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who submitted an investig@@ ator &apos;s investig@@ ator .
it does not work for a single top pole , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of rules .
we must change the rules in order to make this type of behavior .
this may sound very well @-@ en@@ nig as if we could do anything about it ; as if nothing might have changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optimization , I definitely see that a lot has started to change .
in the last few years , we have seen more transparency to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has hit the central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA followed suit .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in the two parliamentary chambers , but this makes it not the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure in the U.S. and globally for more transparency .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are w@@ ager if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
we need managers in the business that rise and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and end it to end through laws this type of transparency .
together we can termin@@ ate the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally qu@@ it .
this is the story , as I am almost kidn@@ apped and in boot of a red Maz@@ das would be landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a farm selling .
one guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked upon my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road journey through the whole country . after this he would go to the Friedens@@ cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he talked about me as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just learned about it ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; h , how , please ? &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what I was broken out ?
a wild ass sleeps in my living room .
what when it is crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I got up out of the bed , at a ti@@ dy tip to the door , and closed my sleep door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
it was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps people who were sold to me as strangers were sold in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting for it ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let us take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates from and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it to transform your fear of fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I forgot to earn something like this . our apartment is equipped with a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including breakfast and breakfast included .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three fortun@@ ate guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor with 20 dollars on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we also .
I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et completely different because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest leaving the door into the castle , Brian and I finished .
did we have just discovered that we could find new friends and rent our rent ?
things came in rolls .
my former co @-@ inhabitants , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we would need to figure out whether one could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a site , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closes when visiting .
the Internet can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would ign@@ iter .
but she did not do .
no one who is still with consol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows people to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all learned as children , foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can see the things that one can be good . we designated the following code .
at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create confidence through design that had never been hit .
can design so aff@@ ord ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree of trust we troubled .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked phone on your left seat .
this silent flight from pan@@ ic you will feel right -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when it will open the door for the first time .
for the only thing as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toil@@ ette .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in my hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
you can also feel the most guests if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell now ?
could you declare on Twitter , that he de@@ codes for the Office of the Pre@@ sidents ?
you can now return your phone .
they have experienced , what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what would be , if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor has appeared only once with his name ; if he could tell whence he &apos;s coming , like his dog or his children ?
imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , who say : &quot; he can really be very well relaxed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you need to give your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ covered feedback system strengthens trust decisive .
at the beginning we had some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest comments were submitted before we issued online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how probably it is that people trust in one another , depending on how they are at the age and place of residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly we trust the people most that are most common .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
that is a natural social bias .
exciting , when you add to the call of a person -- in our case of ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three acts , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of simil@@ itude .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots .
Moreover , we learned that trust is depending on how much you are .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you are too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
tell you too much , as for example : &quot; I have trouble with my mother &quot; -- -- it is not accepted on request .
so , there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design , produce this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds upon hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages of strangers .
with which we had not expected , the great amount of people who were more than prepared to deposit these advantages .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
for us the shop runs very well .
of course there are times even if not everything is smooth .
there were guests who have allowed parties to do or devast@@ ated flats .
you will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I joined the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was standing in front of the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . I wo@@ ke up when I think of it .
the dis@@ appointment , which one hears in the voice of the calls , was also always our biggest motivation to improve us further .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there had been a fra@@ ction of 123 million overnight stays only a fra@@ ction of a problem .
for people trusted in one another .
when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us works can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angel who save a life even though they don &apos;t know yet .
you drive one in your own car at the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel themselves , they bring books .
you can stay one even longer , without charge the extra nights .
I only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay starts .
but these relationships behind pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
for the first time I heard about this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of part with money trans@@ missions together ?
there is a economic trade here .
but it just now just like &quot; rental industry &quot; to name , the thing is not justified .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays it is possible to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but is less authentic .
what would however be if travelling a rich buffet from local income ?
what if in every place where you visited , a group there would have to wait for a thoroughly and one at a cat @-@ pent@@ ine quarter have never heard of which one has never heard ;
or if one could learn cooking about a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would be when we would like to share apartments for the reason ?
what would that look like ?
what would be when cities would have to take advantage of common benefits ?
I present to myself cities which enable us and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and am@@ ort@@ ment .
South Korea &apos;s capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of places that belonged to the government ,
now they were offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were medi@@ ated on humans , their children were retired . they were launched with incubation programs .
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest account for a stranger or even more hosts .
the idea , so it seems not so nuts , as it was brought to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
we have even read it before .
it was already similar to us .
so why did our work work ?
apart from luck and timing we realized that we can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep roots elements .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
a great overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da will pass over me .
we of course know that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it was great influence , I wonder what we could use the design soon .
thank you . thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a believers ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or op@@ pressed , under@@ wear a brain ?
or simply a delay when security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so , the media represent people , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know any Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t speak with their ha@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never learned a Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ holding -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m able to sing ,
a se@@ cular @-@ time fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ k ,
and I am a pract@@ ising , spiritual muscle .
but not like Lady G@@ aga : because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to have decided .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you op@@ pressed yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ ige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist of independence , namely the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old feeling to fit me a perfect and amazing beauty ideal .
I have not only believed the belief of my parents .
I signed with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought after , exhibited in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , referring to each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k bring me sometimes even to the wines .
I know me myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone is real , you understand it , and somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started , like all the Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly what they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looking at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ ab@@ un . &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people walking from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock was turned to indig@@ nation quickly .
why should I do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ bers Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the works of others from a citizen to a susp@@ ects .
on that same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat , and I was afraid that it was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , I read and read the war@@ nings of the Islamic Emirate , which said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not ast@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then Friday was on Friday in that week -- the day to gather Muslims for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings of themselves were pru@@ dent and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims , and struck him in free .
there were really industry suggestions on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because people who had attacked the land have attacked our land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I pushed the rage of people to the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain himself .
I have no questions concerning questions , I love questions .
there are the charges that are hard .
today , we can say really people : &quot; there is a problem in this land -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
is it only the question : are we mal@@ icious or non @-@ dangerous ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor was removed as a whole and a good tumor it is just under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , such as all the Americans , not a tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you ! thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , terrestrial and Olympi@@ ad .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America make sure ?
there may be a couple of parking free , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque will lead to people other faith toler@@ ant to consider and larger civil participation .
and as head of the police in the Washington region , D.C. recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
during the radio process , it has found that it starts online . as a first person , the person is cut off by their family , so that the person believes that the terror@@ ists seem to have the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology is ab@@ sent or from faith .
if we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
ultimately , a group like the IS strengthens its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their hearts , when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful .
thank you ! thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one look at her , she does not drive out what they are in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is her brood @-@ ality , which they can read these things in writing .
an extraordinary Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because it was regard to the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , she brought them to silence , and told her anger , her mind for un@@ righteousness in the world , that she would only bring them in trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that would have given sense of their gro@@ ove , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extreme extrem@@ ists who spoke about their solution .
and this Im@@ am turned the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use it for their gro@@ ove , he showed their constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , kept it before to join the IS .
that was an insight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia suffered me and my family .
but how does it work for normal US ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ ous studies -- suggest : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian governmental system , conformity and pre@@ sentences .
a study shows : if man reports messages , in which negative over Muslims were reported , they vote rather military attacks to Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood attack against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of the war and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear fell upon us all .
in assignment of collective debt , it is not only the way to declare themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was involved in dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , and ...
his sister would say to me that he was the south , the most generous one , whom she knew .
she visited him there , and showed her res@@ ume . she was amaz@@ ed and said :
&quot; when is such an experienced young man from my breasts ? &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne near her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered them , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted on the afternoon . he did it in their app@@ artment , after he posted ut@@ ations against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or we stayed at home safely ?
we spoke it and for us it was no light decision , for it was therefore that America would like to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we chose for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and I drew out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me keep .
the hall was completely drunk .
then , the Im@@ am sent an announcement to bed@@ side and called our guests , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but for us .
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
those people were there because they had the courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go at number safe ?
or will you join it , which think that : we are better than those of them .
thank you so much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v hit .
but I ask me what you say that you may say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a memorial with low @-@ speed work , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t think . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study on Muslims throughout the world , people want to form normal things .
they want to be a pro@@ sper@@ ity for the family , they want to work and want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any respect .
if people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists just before to become a one billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is possible to research in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ pack@@ ets entered into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France opened a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with cords .
achiev@@ able by connecting terminals high speed and acceleration on the highest space .
they can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
in order that a system works in aut@@ os@@ om , it must be collective en@@ rol@@ ment , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s dem@@ os we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are given at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient in the back@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most strong wings , it can be a great advantage over the start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a side facing .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ finder is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter , the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research , we often have fundamental abstract questions that are sum@@ med up to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to a question .
helicopter are known about machines with a thousand moving parts known to gather together to viol@@ ate you .
recently , educ@@ ated pilots have been flying remote control units that had only two moving parts : one propeller and a h@@ edge p@@ ushing .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner that is mechanically sim@@ pl@@ eted flight . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no cl@@ auses , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ ders , no further positions or control areas , only one propeller .
although mechanically sim@@ pler is very much , it happens very much in the interior , so that it can be stable and can move in space over space .
nevertheless it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it right correctly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly correctly , when all of you see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in lon@@ el@@ iness , this machine is here , the om@@ od@@ d with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this sur@@ flow ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is a ambi@@ ence in his alignment .
thereby he gets the right of the un@@ confirmed ability ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned and even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is listed in models , the rest will be learned directly at the fly .
let us see that .
once a flight machine should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they feel like a high performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a bit low -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , if restricted .
we will demonstrate that , by making a half flight .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commerci@@ ally available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ ating technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , you can motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway , the particularly secure machine would like to display a flying lamp par@@ ach@@ ment on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct influence of this technology .
for types such as us lies the reward in the development and work act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , wise si@@ ps allowed to form them in so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential , the t@@ ittle in the i .
thank you so much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes have disappeared each other , they turned back to the mass of three n@@ uns in pure energy .
this short moment they lighted brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big b@@ ye .
but they put not their energy in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ by itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us move the events first time .
1.3 billion years ago , a majority of earth was produced on earth .
since then , the Earth has produced a lot of coral : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ ter@@ rier , people , and -- God stand up -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group particularly courage to build -- R@@ ai Weiss by MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about c@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes .
most were they for crazy .
but enough people knew it as a mad gen@@ ius so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , concept and extrem@@ ly hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ res @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observatory .
during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increase what the detection rate is tremend@@ ously improved .
therefore , one calls him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clear some smaller , hard @-@ difficult problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ds through the earth through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my father &apos;s death .
in this reason , the fruits of my life .
all this I had worked for me is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through ob@@ servat@@ ories like L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an ru@@ ction of space and time .
while passing the wave , the shaft and its complete contents will be stretched in a direction and put into the other .
for illustr@@ ative lec@@ tur@@ ers in c@@ iss@@ ors at the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on 14th September , for example , each of us stretched out the waves and stopped . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the L@@ IG@@ O employee was declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , the length should be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear generation . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are great .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are inv@@ alid , and with the support of the public shall be overcome by obstacles . &quot;
in 1973 , Thor@@ ne published this family , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott proves that L@@ IG@@ O was more than one ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ i@@ als , size your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . for example , you can create a picture or a map of things ready by perc@@ eive the light of several points for you around .
with killing is that different .
the audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , virtually impossible to produce an image of things to make you very much :
the face of your child approximately .
instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and lou@@ dness , to close the history behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she breaks out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; g@@ rief Bob &quot; .
the same is for Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them no simple images of objects in all .
but by finding any changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can speak the all literally .
the grav@@ itation may wait for us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes so my colleague Scott has already worked very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , bars simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion , shaped into the shaft shape .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I must never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O heard - heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ render the sound &#93; no one that needs to hear , det@@ ects this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times the sun mass , which can rotate around as fast as the rod of your mixer .
AA : is superior to us what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 S@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 tons , revol@@ ve about one hundred times a second before it col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it , because we heard it .
there is the lasting importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is a completely new way to explore the universe as they never before was possible .
on this road we can listen to the All and the invisible .
many things in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or generally -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why it explo@@ de the same stars in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about all things .
the exciting physical processes are done at the core , which is behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see it because these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the prim@@ itive thing : I would like to search the first minutes of the algae , but we will never see it because the ur@@ b@@ ulation is veil@@ ed through its own ob@@ en@@ ligh@@ tening .
it should be possible to reflect back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we never see yet , and from which we do not have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O did , in fact , in the first sight of what we had not expected .
my fellow at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes such as L@@ IG@@ O , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so@@ ared for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to view a completely different angle of view over the events in all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be so cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and sounds of the cos@@ mos and the ic@@ c@@ ubs of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a completely new generation of Ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and all in all .
for what could be beautiful , than to listen to the ur@@ selves ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you . thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it was nerv@@ ous to me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted me to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what I was to do , I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear to keep words , my social distress -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the Power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my youngest ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; refle@@ ctions , &quot;
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimates , I need milk for my sa@@ wing . &quot;
she once said to them once I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the start
a new life setting in my family . from there I will always swear to them always with them as soon as you have to do with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing straight or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single times .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I &apos;m tired of that .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has a dis@@ concer@@ ting side effect : only recently , I was in fact that the &quot; Yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of things , and awake my life to life .
a dream job .
no , no .
I am a Titan .
a dream job .
I create television . I producer TV .
I &apos;m making TV in great style .
in this TV season , I have to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that were not existing before .
the budget for an episode of a television sen@@ ders can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days by four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million television broadcast , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously , four episodes , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way with murder , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running on Thursday night .
over the world , my series runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created himself , and not only produced , so still going . I have to find time , really cool , creative time to gather my fans to bon@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that around the world .
do you know who still does that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
a dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who are so hard work if you now have a company , a country or a budget , so you &apos;ll understand that I am not only around the computer , and it is true if I say : I understand that there is a dream job not going to dream .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything , everything blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I set up the tro@@ ups on a canvas , when I was painted on a canvas .
it &apos;s as a dream man a high tone , kno@@ bs a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ Ã© .
and all that is at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , funny and mal@@ nour@@ ished , cruel and sen@@ su@@ al , fierce and sen@@ sible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working is good .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever .
many people assume if I declare to them the sum@@ s that I speak a letter that the letter is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with the television production , when I began to work and work together to create and work together , I discovered this thing this sum@@ s , these energy .
the sum@@ s is more than the letter .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot go different than after size .
the feeling that no different can be compared to size , no matter what price .
this is the name of the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means to be a workflow .
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I did not work for the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I only want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make a clear : depending on the greater extent , more episodes , the more things , the more work , the more things get more , the more things observe me , the more things I write to history so much more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more the more needs to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ crow@@ ded , over@@ crow@@ ded , over@@ loaded .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is the only working institute .
Har@@ per tells it : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estimates , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I just loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium as@@ le@@ ep not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a preview of Show Titanium ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so , what do you do , if you do , do the work that you love , suddenly per@@ ver@@ ed ?
I know , some people think : &quot; ha@@ ylo@@ l you , bl@@ oss@@ ess the author Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do , you do , you can do what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s , and knows how to stop the sum if the sum@@ s stopped , who is then ?
what are you like ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South @-@ States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; represents me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to outside , late turn and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to tell no more that two things are deliber@@ ately aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to all and second , she called me not &quot; concep@@ tual . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estimates . &quot;
when is that happen ?
I hate it if I smo@@ ked Titan bin and my sum , and it changes everything before my own eyes .
and this is what they say : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and her sisters , we laugh at a lot and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; book .
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sea , I can do anything but to fit apart .
I &apos;m focused .
I &apos;m silent .
the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists are st@@ icky finger and dam@@ aging kiss@@ es , delicate voices , w@@ ax@@ e pins and the song , in which there is a lot , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly be bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I guess .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
an ment@@ ale door comes to and an energy boost comes in .
and that immediately happens , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but one sum@@ s .
and now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . it is all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the job um@@ ms , the titanium surface , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , you who are , if I am telling you if I &apos;m making me out of broad@@ casts and TV hours , and how working my brain , then I forgot what is the true sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum is the river , which comes from the feeling of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ red the pressure of history , which contribute to heavy tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I have been doing this for a firm , so that I can rid me as a workouts from any gu@@ ilt .
it is the law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , unless I want to hear the sum@@ s .
I wish it was so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play me not an@@ sat@@ an@@ ise as working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather prefer to work as home .
this conception is painful , because what a man is working rather than to be house ?
well , I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am going to be , is none of them .
we tur@@ f in the garden , and back , and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ um@@ ble soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always looked after my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children tell me how one lives , and the sum of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also say it ! do they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep myself for n@@ ai@@ v for a day dre@@ aming .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child you can find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they &apos;re going to make something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes away .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ o or K@@ eks replaces me .
and he speaks my te@@ ens daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each can bring about 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no deposit .
the day is short : dinners , do not use children .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my Charity , my world . it does not have to be the kids . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not all games with her own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play@@ ing &quot; in general .
learn the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out it and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and stayed . friends meet , books , reading the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for everything I did when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass even more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes in a piece , why not full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seems to return , if I do not work .
working not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months open a door , the energy flow@@ ed in , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fulfil@@ s me and my soul . I am going back to new ideas . I use it in full breeding and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and therefore I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is be@@ u@@ ppe I &apos;m a Titan bin . I have never seen a titanium which he plays to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to fewer work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the better , I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel good .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ having , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m the author . I think of things , I will establish you for life .
this belongs to the job , this means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en got no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful . thank you .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to support self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
that is the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgery ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerv@@ ous functions through various surgical actions .
sure they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ cl@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neu@@ rolo@@ gic function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered under severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach to this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with a little help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was the medi@@ a@@ doctor and worked day and night in the not@@ ices .
I often provided patients with cran@@ ul@@ ls @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that brain brain trau@@ mat@@ a de@@ but@@ t the brain and inclined the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , you need to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes , you have to remove a piece of s@@ wollen hin@@ ge mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this t@@ issues .
that is not a simple task .
cells from a tissue grow , is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families .
you have to find the correct diet , temperature , moisture and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
just that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean FranÃ§ois was executed .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . it is surrounded by large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from Bi@@ ological classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of brain .
it is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slow down and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand from whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called bi@@ li@@ qu@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our pat@@ ern@@ ity cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get to us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of brain , as we find them in higher levels of brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing enables .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area and then cul@@ tured cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois
and then it tou@@ ches the colour to trace them in the brain .
in the final step we im@@ planted them at the admission rate of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ splantation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ plant@@ ing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been taken after a few weeks when they had been taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we attached a violation and im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained to attack neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these little points . these are the cells that we painted in vitro , in the culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop this .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injuries ?
so we trained ap@@ es with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take feed back from a tablet .
they did that very well .
as they had achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we injured the motor mot@@ ic field in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously by a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover the plastic brain mechanisms . they are moving to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side , you see the monkey , which recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time we found much more about these cells .
we can freeze it then freeze and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still being im@@ planted in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you so much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who need it . &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question of which the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : that is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ici@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start of clinical trials . if you see further into the future , how many years it takes , until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose the treatment to evaluate and evaluate the treatment if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
you need to apply this to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
one must really show that it is useful before being able to offer this treatment .
BG : and that &apos;s sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and tells us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changeable encoder .
we believe that capitalism is inev@@ itable to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democ@@ rati@@ cally .
in fact , democracy is dis@@ appears with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- the democratic process of our country -- Our elections -- not the au@@ ster@@ ity programmes may have been realized in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better right @-@ just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my emerging friends who would repeat me when democracy would be abolished .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save the democracy , but we might need a true democracy .
because without democracy , our societies are common , our future is dark , and our great , new technologies are sp@@ itted .
to the subject I would like to indicate an interesting contra@@ diction which currently our taver@@ n are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . know and recognize him as the Scho@@ ol@@ berg , which th@@ rows his long shade over the United States , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ ol@@ berg ,
but just a few recognize its to@@ d@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which include the well @-@ known as@@ par@@ agus and concert , however , to invest in where it would be productive and revenues , with which one might produce the debt of Schul@@ den@@ berg and even all those things could produce humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the U.S. , in England and the Eurozone fell 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars , in all the pro@@ sper@@ ity of producing goods , such as industrial machinery , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
it sounds 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars according to a lot of money until you move with the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except for the stock market and the real estate prices .
so , debts and non @-@ productive capital are the tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins , which are not in the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently provides a low overall economic demand that could not be investing in which they could not invest . just like Ã@@ z@@ pus Father , which could be true that his son would kill him when he is growing ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that lead to it that oil @-@ body k@@ ills him .
this is my hair with the capitalism --
his extremely con@@ ical art . all the in@@ productive capital should be used to further develop our lives and finance , human talents , and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is Democracy &apos;s solution ?
but before we proceed . but before we proceed : what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the party form , in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government .
of course , the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy decided of course too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the shift value of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision @-@ making of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they did not only enter the working arms , and not only the right to free expression of expression , but important and crucial , giving them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal m@@ oods in questions of state rank@@ ings .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy does not have long kept --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very light , it is also un@@ folded quickly .
however , our today &apos;s liberal democratic ra@@ cies did not have roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy decided on the value of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy is the world of the concert -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our present democ@@ ra@@ cies , since the time , in which the separation of politics and economy began , an inheritance battle between the two took place , the economy gradually appro@@ ves the politics and dispos@@ ed them .
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is estimated that one can be in the government today and yet not in power because the power of politics in the economy is di@@ ander@@ ed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with the capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about such as a herd of rough@@ ness , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that she was after@@ mat@@ ured at the end .
similar to the economy , which grows as far as far as the economic crisis itself , it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the companies increases , economic demand is rising and the general managers of the companies are becoming fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
according to capitalism , &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ist summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the wealth of humanity .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the expul@@ sion of slaves , the women and the alien .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea about 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go well .
the law from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover through a miracle such as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the workers &apos; labour !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage transactions through automation and robot .
the problem is thereby such as long economy and politics separate areas , the automation the tw@@ ins of the tw@@ ins are higher , the waste resolution , and the social conflicts are deeper ( as it is - very soon as I think -- in countries like China ) .
so , we must combine the economy and the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democ@@ rati@@ cally par@@ don@@ ate the re@@ united area , otherwise we will be able to escape the movie &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation .
so the question is not whether capitalism , the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether the &quot; matrix , &quot; is super@@ se@@ ded or replaced by something that the society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; resem@@ bles the human being in the investigation of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ic &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like it could look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; @-@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar to have D@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you a moment to call some examples .
in the field of enterprises : please make a capital market in which you earn money , while working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and from funds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhau@@ led .
no differentiation between those who are not working there , but employees who work there , but employees who work there , but they do not hear , no longer le@@ aps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no exc@@ essi@@ vely charged tw@@ ins .
in the area of the global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency , we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common funds .
imagine that this fund invests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment statistics are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one could not implement the technical resources at that time .
today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world , which I command you , is more liberal , in which they prefer@@ ed privileged individuals , and mar@@ x@@ ish because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ tray of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ast@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or are we to sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to contact us together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you have described yourself in your biography himself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have said just is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do not do this , technological development will produce a massive decline in overall demand of overall demand , which Larry sum@@ mers &quot; is called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experi@@ encing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our democ@@ ra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfectly effective .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the Red@@ ner dinner you have told you what you think from the point of view of the West to China .
want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democratic democracy we have the form of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy at the policy , whereas the area where most of the economy plays , -- the area of business -- a totally democratic zone is .
in some resp@@ ects , if I may say the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to that of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect Liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is an error , historically unique .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , concerning the democratic development .
what we can watch in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now refuse to do that which was done by the West in the 19th century , terrible after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eu@@ ro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to adopt us of self @-@ compl@@ ying , and the lasting den@@ ial that a massive acquisition line went down through the Eurozone , and continues to impos@@ e massi@@ vely at the development of all European Union .
we had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pre @-@ slaughter -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal that den@@ ial --
it is right to do it . unfortunately the powers in the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is non @-@ life through political will and authorization to life , you may have to spend a while , but if the change occurs , it ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly .
BG : what change do you see before ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eu@@ ro@@ zone has no future when we do not change its structure .
BG : did you have any error in your time as the finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , born after 6 months in office , especially in such a cl@@ amped situation , he did not make any mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made an error .
the biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest in pages of the banknotes to find a common solution .
but this was not the case .
they only wanted to bring out our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the insur@@ ances in the euro area .
they didn &apos;t want to be found that they were through a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the Money , who puts us up this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was a col@@ oss@@ al error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive p@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be quite reasonable pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my cr@@ iti@@ que of the European Union and the Eurozone , opposed to som@@ eb@@ ody who lives in Europe and loves .
my biggest concern is that the Eurozone will not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released fli@@ ck@@ ering forces will be demon@@ ic and the European Union destroy .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose us the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , that it appears to me , it will also be also able to be the future of Europeans such as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are in this point wrong .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for you were with T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ is@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce Amazon .
of course , it is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot be selected .
he needs to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
that are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing bath , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after having a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- it should tell you enough to desc@@ end at the end of the turn .
Roy Price does not help to come on the left side of the curve , because I think it is already a special intelligence to supp@@ ress &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle view , the average TV -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t feel .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is available and of course it is the first time that Amazon is something like this , so Roy price does not risk .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he will hold a contest .
he has many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses with an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online , wherever they can look for free .
and if Amazon is used for free things , you ri@@ p@@ ens properly ?
some millions of viewers visited this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watching these shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team that make it all .
you capture when you start the show when you jumps , which parts are over@@ jumps and again .
you collect millions of data to choose which show them should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and it follows the answer , and this is the answer : &quot; Amazon is supposed to make a Sit@@ Com over four republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
anyone knows the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that you can &apos;t remember that show , because it was not so good .
it is just an average Show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- thus somewhat above average but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company , another manager has place a top show through data analysis . its name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , it is always on the search to find this a super @-@ show , but he uses something differently .
instead of a contest , he and his team looked forward the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then take advantage of these data to figure out these small details about the viewer : what shows they like what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a car and decided to do not an Sit@@ Com over four trans@@ formers , but a drama series over a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this turn . so exactly there where they wanted .
of course , now is the question : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data se@@ per@@ ed firms .
they combine these many data and it will work super for one of them but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because Logic somehow said that , in all , the logic should work .
if you are collecting millions of data for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very high performance computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working so well , this is something sc@@ ary because we live in a time , in which we have more and more statistics to meet serious discussions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come in contact with this software . if you come in touch , you are in prison .
if anyone has been in prison here in the US and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person is good or bad .
average TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated , that is not sure a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems can &apos;t know how to use data .
the data of the test companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google may make mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could say through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way to predi@@ ct -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news session . the success was successful in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data will be versi@@ fied like Amazon and Google sometimes .
despite all these mist@@ akes linked to the decisions of life one -- at the workplace , at the legal action , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
also I know many trouble with data . I work in computer @-@ based Genet@@ ics -- a territory , with the some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of an medication . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ sem@@ inated .
if you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a first cut this problem in its components , so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place the single parts return together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and merge .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can help only break a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we have all : our brain .
when there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete to hold then a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong to the process .
you use data to understand the audience better , what else could not have been able . but the decision , how to make all these parts , draw and draw a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; , which was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first created as they voted by TV @-@ ideas , then as they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; we will tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong when data do to start our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget is this device quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before it was possible , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
there is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions made by a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you will just shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly probably &quot; -- just here at this moment .
I &apos;ll see it later with a technique of technology .
I have met some decisions in my life until now , where I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace this by something much le@@ ased , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic construction .
and perhaps the ball cle@@ ver and cle@@ ver and cle@@ ver . finally there is to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I want to encourage this to be a very encour@@ aging news , that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions made , an expert in what you &apos;re doing and risks .
at the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you l@@ end at the right side of the turn .
thanks beautiful . thank you .
