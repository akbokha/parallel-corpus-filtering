<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize for the New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anybody had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA listened illegally by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, which literally survived the CIA in Iran for a atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not feel the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been determined against rats and prompted him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, it became a symbol of the government, Whistleblower and to violate journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this law, if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the Much.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government arrived at rats, he did something what many courageous reporter did before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, from 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they were years old in years that it was indispensable for their case, the claims of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and rats to make statements, this could also do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his incomprehension, worried his phone numbers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, finance and banker information, its lending information, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Riss.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to his demands, Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary more condemns any US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that a problem can be, particularly because the government is too many of their work than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September, almost every article about national security entered the result that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has always has more possibilities to fill out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take it from the moment, in which they contact, rather than in the case, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not existed as rats his book, and it is much safer than ordinary e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transition system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet by Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, as are the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant News Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot find more information in secret, and many of the information that would like it would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments developing all the world will always develop new spy technologies that endanger ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to us to ensure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have a way to bring abuse. it is just important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The abduction of abnormalities in the supply of soldiers have knowledge and reported of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for contemplated water of flint. or a Wall-Insider who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crime, but to protect against our constitutionality.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest database of the history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that empires and MÃ¤chental] [enormous money sums] have hidden in tax havens.] this week we received from news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's resident law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents shows a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of what customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Muslims Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">Actually, we will actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already been very direct consequences for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland prime minister has returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ban of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stationed in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is asserted that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead through a close friend from children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait the nervous to the next publication, and unveil documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now all sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be removed from you, me, unusual people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that's all concerned.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havases of some few are used to hide and swallow their fortune -- anything that we have been discussing and unveil them for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will be very confusing, and it's hard to understand how this tax havens will work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matryoshrib.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has one company in another company, in another company what makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is it.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that were present in this disclosure, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that you hide your fortune in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle of which tax havens will work, mosquito Fonseca has less US customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have some data from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one need less information in some US states to get less information to create a company than to get a library identity card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of the inactivity in the USA has allowed the employees of school-districts allowed to prevent school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to have sojourn, especially vulnerable offences.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is the way of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a discovered investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring doubling money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked all that up to an advocate of our investigator's proposal, how he could transferring his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preschooled. no one of these lawyers participated as a client, and of course no one was given to anyone's money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who submitted an investigator's investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not work for a single top pole, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules in order to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very well-ennig as if we could do anything about it; as if nothing might have changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimization, I definitely see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years, we have seen more transparency to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has hit the central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA followed suit.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in the two parliamentary chambers, but this makes it not the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure in the U.S. and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are wager if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the business that rise and say: "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and end it to end through laws this type of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can terminate the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally quit.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I am almost kidnapped and in boot of a red Mazdas would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a farm selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked upon my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road journey through the whole country. after this he would go to the Friedenscorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he talked about me as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he did the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just learned about it! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't abducted in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "h, how, please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what I was broken out?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild ass sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What when it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I got up out of the bed, at a tidy tip to the door, and closed my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me as strangers were sold in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting for it?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates from and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it to transform your fear of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I forgot to earn something like this. our apartment is equipped with a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including breakfast and breakfast included.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three fortunate guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor with 20 dollars on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham Omelet completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest leaving the door into the castle, Brian and I finished.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we have just discovered that we could find new friends and rent our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitants, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We would need to figure out whether one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a site, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closes when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">The Internet can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would igniter.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not do.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still with consolation would invest in a business that allows people to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children, foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can see the things that one can be good. we designated the following code.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create confidence through design that had never been hit.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so afford?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree of trust we troubled.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight from panic you will feel right -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when it will open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilette.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked phone of a stranger in my hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You can also feel the most guests if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter, that he decodes for the Office of the Presidents?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return your phone.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced, what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would be, if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor has appeared only once with his name; if he could tell whence he's coming, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 assessments, who say: "he can really be very well relaxed mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you need to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-covered feedback system strengthens trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we had some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest comments were submitted before we issued online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how probably it is that people trust in one another, depending on how they are at the age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most that are most common.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting, when you add to the call of a person -- in our case of assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three acts, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similitude.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we learned that trust is depending on how much you are.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you are too little, like "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tell you too much, as for example: "I have trouble with my mother" -- -- it is not accepted on request.</seg>
<seg id="190">So, there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds upon hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages of strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not expected, the great amount of people who were more than prepared to deposit these advantages.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times even if not everything is smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed parties to do or devastated flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">You will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I joined the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was standing in front of the front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. I woke up when I think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which one hears in the voice of the calls, was also always our biggest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, there had been a fraction of 123 million overnight stays only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wondrous works can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who save a life even though they don't know yet.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car at the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel themselves, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay starts.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">For the first time I heard about this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transmissions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">There is a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just now just like "rental industry" to name, the thing is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays it is possible to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would however be if travelling a rich buffet from local income?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place where you visited, a group there would have to wait for a thoroughly and one at a cat-pentine quarter have never heard of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if one could learn cooking about a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be when we would like to share apartments for the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be when cities would have to take advantage of common benefits?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present to myself cities which enable us and relationships, instead of solitude and amortment.</seg>
<seg id="239">South Korea's capital of Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of places that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now they were offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated on humans, their children were retired. they were launched with incubation programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest account for a stranger or even more hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea, so it seems not so nuts, as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">We have even read it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">It was already similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that we can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep roots elements.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">A great overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda will pass over me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it was great influence, I wonder what we could use the design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, underwear a brain?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay when security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media represent people, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think that most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people don't speak with their haber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never learned a Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-holding -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm able to sing,</seg>
<seg id="271">A secular-time fitness fanatikerk,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practising, spiritual muscle.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga: because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oun me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist of independence, namely the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old feeling to fit me a perfect and amazing beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the belief of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I signed with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, exhibited in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, referring to each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik bring me sometimes even to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know me myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone is real, you understand it, and somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly what they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looking at the screen and saw the word "Eilabun."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people walking from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was turned to indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... "" "..." in the name of Islam... "" "..." Jihadist... "" "" bombers Mecca! "" "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned me the works of others from a citizen to a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On that same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat, and I was afraid that it was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard, I read and read the warnings of the Islamic Emirate, which said:" "" "be careful," "" "Be careful," "" "lead in well lit areas," "" "not astray." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then Friday was on Friday in that week -- the day to gather Muslims for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings," "" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings of themselves were prudent and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims, and struck him in free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really industry suggestions on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"" "because people who had attacked the land have attacked our land." ""</seg>
<seg id="315">I pushed the rage of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have no questions concerning questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the charges that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can say really people: "there is a problem in this land -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Is it only the question: are we malicious or non-dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor was removed as a whole and a good tumor it is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, such as all the Americans, not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you! thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, terrestrial and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America make sure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a couple of parking free, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque will lead to people other faith tolerant to consider and larger civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as head of the police in the Washington region, D.C. recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radio process, it has found that it starts online. as a first person, the person is cut off by their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists seem to have the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is absent or from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to avoid radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Ultimately, a group like the IS strengthens its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their hearts, when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you! thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if one look at her, she does not drive out what they are in" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is her brood-ality, which they can read these things in writing.</seg>
<seg id="346">An extraordinary Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because it was regard to the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, she brought them to silence, and told her anger, her mind for unrighteousness in the world, that she would only bring them in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that would have given sense of their groove, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extreme extremists who spoke about their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">And this Imam turned the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse it for their groove, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, kept it before to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, as the Islamophobia suffered me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work for normal US?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientious studies -- suggest: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian governmental system, conformity and presentences.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if man reports messages, in which negative over Muslims were reported, they vote rather military attacks to Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood attack against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of the war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public, to undermining the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear fell upon us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In assignment of collective debt, it is not only the way to declare themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was involved in dental faculty, talented, promising, and...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the south, the most generous one, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and showed her resume. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such an experienced young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne near her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted on the afternoon. he did it in their appartment, after he posted utations against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, or we stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We spoke it and for us it was no light decision, for it was therefore that America would like to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and I drew out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me keep.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely drunk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Imam sent an announcement to bedside and called our guests, because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come, not to attack us, but for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">Those people were there because they had the courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go at number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join it, which think that: we are better than those of them.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have a Nerv hit.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask me what you say that you may say that you are a TEDTalk, a memorial with low-speed work, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't think. I am perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study on Muslims throughout the world, people want to form normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to be a prosperity for the family, they want to work and want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists just before to become a one billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is possible to research in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packets entered into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France opened a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with cords.</seg>
<seg id="410">Achievable by connecting terminals high speed and acceleration on the highest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens, to deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order that a system works in autosom, it must be collective enrolment, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are given at the highest Ebene. g." "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the backward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most strong wings, it can be a great advantage over the start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a side facing.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgefinder is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter, the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often have fundamental abstract questions that are summed up to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about machines with a thousand moving parts known to gather together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Recently, educated pilots have been flying remote control units that had only two moving parts: one propeller and a hedge pushing.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner that is mechanically simpleted flight. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clauses, hinges and cross-ruders, no further positions or control areas, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although mechanically simpler is very much, it happens very much in the interior, so that it can be stable and can move in space over space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly correctly, when all of you see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is a exercise in loneliness, this machine is here, the omodd with its eight propellers, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this surflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is a ambience in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he gets the right of the unconfirmed ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned and even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers from eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is listed in models, the rest will be learned directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">Once a flight machine should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they feel like a high performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit low -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by making a half flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with locating technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you can motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway, the particularly secure machine would like to display a flying lamp parachment on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us lies the reward in the development and work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, wise sips allowed to form them in so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential, the tittle in the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes have disappeared each other, they turned back to the mass of three nuns in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lighted brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bye.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put not their energy in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-by itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us move the events first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a majority of earth was produced on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced a lot of coral: corals, fish, plants, Sauterrier, people, and -- God stand up -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group particularly courage to build -- Rai Weiss by MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise about clidiating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most were they for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew it as a mad genius so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, concept and extremly hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometres-gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could significantly increase what the detection rate is tremendously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, one calls him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">Beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run to clear some smaller, hard-difficult problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collids through the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's death.</seg>
<seg id="491">In this reason, the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this I had worked for me is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an ruction of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the wave, the shaft and its complete contents will be stretched in a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative lecturers in cissors at the theory of relativity often lead a really albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14th September, for example, each of us stretched out the waves and stopped. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the LIGO employee was declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, the length should be measured on less than a thousandths of a nuclear generation. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are great.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are invalid, and with the support of the public shall be overcome by obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">In 1973, Thorne published this family, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott proves that LIGO was more than one ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facials, size your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can create a picture or a map of things ready by perceive the light of several points for you around.</seg>
<seg id="509">With killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">The audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, virtually impossible to produce an image of things to make you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and loudness, to close the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "she breaks out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"grief Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is for Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by finding any changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can speak the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation may wait for us about the collision of two black holes so my colleague Scott has already worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, bars simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion, shaped into the shaft shape.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I must never forget -- heard LIGO heard - heard LIGO: [Surrender the sound] no one that needs to hear, detects this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times the sun mass, which can rotate around as fast as the rod of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: is superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 Suns, the other with a mass of 36 tons, revolve about one hundred times a second before it collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it, because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the lasting importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the universe as they never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many things in all, we can't see -- practically or generally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why it explode the same stars in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about all things.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are done at the core, which is behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see it because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the primitive thing: I would like to search the first minutes of the algae, but we will never see it because the urbulation is veiled through its own obenlightening.</seg>
<seg id="541">It should be possible to reflect back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we never see yet, and from which we do not have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO did, in fact, in the first sight of what we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My fellow at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes such as LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are soared for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to view a completely different angle of view over the events in all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be so courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and sounds of the cosmos and the iccubs of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of Observatories on Earth and all in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be beautiful, than to listen to the urselves?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long I would" "" "Yes!" "" "before whom I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it was nervous to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted me to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what I was to do, I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep words, my social distress -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The Power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "reflections,"</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimates, I need milk for my sawing."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once said to them once I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the start</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I will always swear to them always with them as soon as you have to do with them. no matter what I'm doing straight or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single times.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I'm tired of that.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a disconcerting side effect: only recently, I was in fact that the "Yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think of things, and awake my life to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No, no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I producer TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making TV in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I have to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that were not existing before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television senders can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days by four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million television broadcast, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously, four episodes, 15 episodes: how To Get Away with murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Over the world, my series runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created himself, and not only produced, so still going. I have to find time, really cool, creative time to gather my fans to bonfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who are so hard work if you now have a company, a country or a budget, so you'll understand that I am not only around the computer, and it is true if I say: I understand that there is a dream job not going to dream.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I set up the troups on a canvas, when I was painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">It's as a dream man a high tone, knobs a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like BeyoncÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that is at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicuous, funny and malnourished, cruel and sensual, fierce and sensible. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume if I declare to them the sums that I speak a letter that the letter is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with the television production, when I began to work and work together to create and work together, I discovered this thing this sums, these energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the letter.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot go different than after size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that no different can be compared to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is the name of the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workflow.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I did not work for the failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: depending on the greater extent, more episodes, the more things, the more work, the more things get more, the more things observe me, the more things I write to history so much more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more the more needs to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overcrowded, overcrowded, overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is the only working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells it: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimates, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I just loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no Reue, nothing delegating, a titanium asleep not exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview of Show Titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do, if you do, do the work that you love, suddenly pervered?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some people think: "haylol you, blossess the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you do, you can do what you're doing to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the sums, and knows how to stop the sum if the sums stopped, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you like?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-States waitress" represents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to outside, late turn and she says:" "" "mom, do you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to tell no more that two things are deliberately aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all and second, she called me not "conceptual."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimates."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it if I smoked Titan bin and my sum, and it changes everything before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And this is what they say: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters, we laugh at a lot and I read very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops" book.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sea, I can do anything but to fit apart.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and damaging kisses, delicate voices, waxe pins and the song, in which there is a lot, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly be breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I guess.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An mentale door comes to and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that immediately happens, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but one sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. it is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the job umms, the titanium surface, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, you who are, if I am telling you if I'm making me out of broadcasts and TV hours, and how working my brain, then I forgot what is the true sums.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the river, which comes from the feeling of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of history, which contribute to heavy tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I have been doing this for a firm, so that I can rid me as a workouts from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is the law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, unless I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it was so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me not ansatanise as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather prefer to work as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This conception is painful, because what a man is working rather than to be house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am going to be, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We turf in the garden, and back, and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crumble soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always looked after my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how one lives, and the sum of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep myself for naiv for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child you can find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they're going to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes away.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienko or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And he speaks my teens daughter for 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring about 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no deposit.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinners, do not use children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my Charity, my world. it does not have to be the kids. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not all games with her own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Playing" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Learn the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and stayed. friends meet, books, reading the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "just for everything I did when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass even more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in a piece, why not full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums seems to return, if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months open a door, the energy flowed in, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fulfils me and my soul. I am going back to new ideas. I use it in full breeding and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and therefore I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is beuppe I'm a Titan bin. I have never seen a titanium which he plays to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to fewer work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the better, I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel good.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the screens, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, behaving, naked and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm the author. I think of things, I will establish you for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, this means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen got no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to support self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgery?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure they have heard of one of the most well known, the "deep-irclstimulation." we implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurologic function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was the mediadoctor and worked day and night in the notices.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with cranulls-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that brain brain traumata debutt the brain and inclined the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you need to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes, you have to remove a piece of swollen hinge mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-FranÃ§ois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">That is not a simple task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a tissue grow, is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the correct diet, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Just that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean FranÃ§ois was executed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. it is surrounded by large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from Biological classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow down and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand from whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called biliquortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our paternity cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of brain, as we find them in higher levels of brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing enables.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-language area and then cultured cells exactly as it did Jean-FranÃ§ois</seg>
<seg id="853">And then it touches the colour to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step we implanted them at the admission rate of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanting these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been taken after a few weeks when they had been taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we attached a violation and implanted the same cells, and now the cells remained to attack neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these little points. these are the cells that we painted in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop this.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injuries?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed back from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they had achieved a stable dexterity level, we injured the motor motic field in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, they recovered spontaneously by a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover the plastic brain mechanisms. they are moving to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, you see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it then freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still being implanted in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know anyone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of which the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very deliciate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start of clinical trials. if you see further into the future, how many years it takes, until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose the treatment to evaluate and evaluate the treatment if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">You need to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must really show that it is useful before being able to offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and tells us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable encoder.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitable to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratically.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is disappears with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I rerepresented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- the democratic process of our country -- Our elections -- not the austerity programmes may have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better right-justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my emerging friends who would repeat me when democracy would be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save the democracy, but we might need a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our societies are common, our future is dark, and our great, new technologies are spitted.</seg>
<seg id="914">To the subject I would like to indicate an interesting contradiction which currently our tavern are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. know and recognize him as the Schoolberg, which throws his long shade over the United States, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schoolberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But just a few recognize its todymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which include the well-known asparagus and concert, however, to invest in where it would be productive and revenues, with which one might produce the debt of Schuldenberg and even all those things could produce humanity, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the U.S., in England and the Eurozone fell 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial machinery, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">It sounds 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars according to a lot of money until you move with the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except for the stock market and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debts and non-productive capital are the twins of twins, which are not in the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently provides a low overall economic demand that could not be investing in which they could not invest. just like Ãzpus Father, which could be true that his son would kill him when he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that lead to it that oil-body kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with the capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely conical art. all the inproductive capital should be used to further develop our lives and finance, human talents, and particularly to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is Democracy's solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed. but before we proceed: what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the party form, in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the athenical democracy decided of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the shift value of the athenian democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision-making of the athenian democracy was and is that they did not only enter the working arms, and not only the right to free expression of expression, but important and crucial, giving them the right to political co-determination with equal moods in questions of state rankings.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy does not have long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is also unfolded quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today's liberal democratic racies did not have roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy decided on the value of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy is the world of the concert -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time, in which the separation of politics and economy began, an inheritance battle between the two took place, the economy gradually approves the politics and disposed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is estimated that one can be in the government today and yet not in power because the power of politics in the economy is diandered and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with the capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about such as a herd of roughness, which so sustainably the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that she was aftermatured at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similar to the economy, which grows as far as far as the economic crisis itself, it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the companies increases, economic demand is rising and the general managers of the companies are becoming frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to capitalism, "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twist summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the expulsion of slaves, the women and the alien.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea about 100 years ago and it didn't go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The law from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover through a miracle such as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the workers' labour!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage transactions through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is thereby such as long economy and politics separate areas, the automation the twins of the twins are higher, the waste resolution, and the social conflicts are deeper (as it is - very soon as I think -- in countries like China).</seg>
<seg id="956">So, we must combine the economy and the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratically pardonate the reunited area, otherwise we will be able to escape the movie "matrix" like a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism, the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether the "matrix," is superseded or replaced by something that the society in "Star Trek" resembles the human being in the investigation of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenic "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like it could look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar to have Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you a moment to call some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of enterprises: please make a capital market in which you earn money, while working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from funds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between those who are not working there, but employees who work there, but employees who work there, but they do not hear, no longer leaps between investment and donors, and ultimately no excessively charged twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of the global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency, we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common funds.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment statistics are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one could not implement the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I command you, is more liberal, in which they prefered privileged individuals, and marxish because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashtray of history, and keynesiian, globally keynesiastian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we to sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to contact us together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You have described yourself in your biography himself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have said just is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do not do this, technological development will produce a massive decline in overall demand of overall demand, which Larry summers "is called" long-term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am perfectly effective.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the Redner dinner you have told you what you think from the point of view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democratic democracy we have the form of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy at the policy, whereas the area where most of the economy plays, -- the area of business -- a totally democratic zone is.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say the so provocative, China is similar to that of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to connect Liberalism to democracy -- this is an error, historically unique.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical, concerning the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can watch in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now refuse to do that which was done by the West in the 19th century, terrible after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to adopt us of self-complying, and the lasting denial that a massive acquisition line went down through the Eurozone, and continues to impose massively at the development of all European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pre-slaughter -- the way, the first suggestion was to reveal that denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do it. unfortunately the powers in the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is non-life through political will and authorization to life, you may have to spend a while, but if the change occurs, it abruptly abruptly abruptly abruptly abruptly.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see before?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any error in your time as the finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, born after 6 months in office, especially in such a clamped situation, he did not make any mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made an error.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in pages of the banknotes to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring out our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the insurances in the euro area.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to be found that they were through a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one from the Troika of the Money, who puts us up this policy," "" "he was a colossal error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive pons of the talks, you seem to be quite reasonable pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My critique of the European Union and the Eurozone, opposed to somebody who lives in Europe and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest concern is that the Eurozone will not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released flickering forces will be demonic and the European Union destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose us the way of a post-modern 1930, that it appears to me, it will also be also able to be the future of Europeans such as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are in this point wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for you were with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelisur and describes herself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, it is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">That are shows like "Breaking bath," "The Wire" -- all the shows that make addictive, where, after having a season, your brain asks: "where is there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- it should tell you enough to descend at the end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not help to come on the left side of the curve, because I think it is already a special intelligence to suppress "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle view, the average TV -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't feel.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available and of course it is the first time that Amazon is something like this, so Roy price does not risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he will hold a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He has many ideas for TV shows and chooses with an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online, wherever they can look for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is used for free things, you ripens properly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Some millions of viewers visited this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team that make it all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you jumps, which parts are overjumps and again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to choose which show them should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and it follows the answer, and this is the answer: "Amazon is supposed to make a SitCom over four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Anyone knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that you can't remember that show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average Show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- thus somewhat above average but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company, another manager has place a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, it is always on the search to find this a super-show, but he uses something differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest, he and his team looked forward the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then take advantage of these data to figure out these small details about the viewer: what shows they like what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a car and decided to do not an SitCom over four transformers, but a drama series over a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this turn. so exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, now is the question: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sepered firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it will work super for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because Logic somehow said that, in all, the logic should work.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you are collecting millions of data for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it through very high performance computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so well, this is something scary because we live in a time, in which we have more and more statistics to meet serious discussions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come in contact with this software. if you come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone has been in prison here in the US and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Average TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated, that is not sure a company like Multi-Health Systems can't know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the test companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google may make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could say through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst way to predict -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news session. the success was successful in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data will be versified like Amazon and Google sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes linked to the decisions of life one -- at the workplace, at the legal action, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many trouble with data. I work in computer-based Genetics -- a territory, with the some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of an medication. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first cut this problem in its components, so you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place the single parts return together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and merge.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can help only break a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete to hold then a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You use data to understand the audience better, what else could not have been able. but the decision, how to make all these parts, draw and draw a show as "House of Cards", which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first created as they voted by TV-ideas, then as they selected "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "we will tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are wrong when data do to start our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget is this device quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was possible, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">There is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions made by a Ja- or no-question you will just shake the ball to get an answer. "highly probably" -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll see it later with a technique of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life until now, where I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace this by something much leased, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic construction.</seg>
<seg id="1135">And perhaps the ball clever and clever and clever. finally there is to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I want to encourage this to be a very encouraging news, that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions made, an expert in what you're doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">At the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you lend at the right side of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful. thank you.</seg>
