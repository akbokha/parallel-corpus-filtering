Munich 1856 - Four maps , which change your views to the city
a w@@ ander , where they will meet you@@ ths today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , which is now under@@ min@@ ed for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ies contra@@ cted the lon@@ ely reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is supporting exciting stories about days .
it is nerv@@ ous when land cards are not currently standing .
this knows everyone who had to go down already because the car Nav@@ i was taking a green meadow instead of a stra@@ ined road .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atl@@ antique , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavarian state government , are all other than currently - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
it is clear how cities and communities in the area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century .
the Digital Bayern Atlas is a tile of tile , which one recognize as such as such .
in the large overview map for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ du She@@ ets .
these were produced according to the Bavarian State Department between 1810 and 1864 and jump the first survey@@ or of Bavaria .
your Prin@@ cipal : Napoleon .
the French army leader has been occupied with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .
Napoleon inv@@ aded a survey of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops inv@@ aded the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville in February 9th , 1801 , they were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph pro@@ pon@@ ed the project further , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and hence the Bavarian Authority &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prototype for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the Bay@@ erische Staatsoper &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / Today is the example of the state capital on the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ mitting , which is relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , so in 1877 , when the Munich district .
today the sub@@ s@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses are concentrated in 1856 as part of today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers &apos; uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing in fields - at first glance : by zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten work pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; document &quot; that was derived from the basic tax .
small par@@ c@@ els provide no farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Sub@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , has actually been a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other hand of Is@@ ar the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of today Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen read only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the guest past@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the pitch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the outside area , one once opened people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &apos; on the Au@@ er fan .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the establishment of the architecture - the psychiat@@ rist who in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the purchase of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistaken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has under@@ ed the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
first place for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places was expanded .
sometime , this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro complex in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER hospital in Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist .
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt there are now te@@ ens in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it to a youth house with vocational training .
the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east residential building from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was established in architectural ref@@ usal to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who had been destroyed during WW@@ II .
the Marien@@ platz was set up in 1856 as &quot; Head Square , &quot; the department &apos;s department name was &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also at the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ b@@ ings of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large stayed until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , a small business houses and a salute of the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ enhof , where these days will work on and on 5 April 2017 of the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights publishing Group Publ@@ ished for Missouri
the National association for the fo@@ ster@@ ing of colored has issued a warning for colored people , due to the dis@@ crimin@@ ating politics and ra@@ cial attacks by the state to Missouri .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Guide to the State of Missouri , which should come into force by 28 August 2017 , demands special attention through the state , since a number of un@@ question@@ able , road @-@ based occurr@@ ences will occur in the last time throughout the country and here is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in the position of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent rec@@ ated law of Missouri , which makes people severe , discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that oppos@@ e the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate of min@@ orities , the group ad@@ mits to the classification , said NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have the rights of civil rights who pass people .
they will be put together because of their skin colour they will be put together or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited as ra@@ cial clubs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in@@ frag@@ ile circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline on the journey , having been arrested by the police in Missouri , without having to be accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers will be more likely to be more common in the state 75 per cent .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring the money to the Cau@@ tion or to know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Missouri recorded in the year 2015 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ crime program of the FB@@ I , which set the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the journey is also a response to a new Missouri Act that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residence or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ator Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel agencies for Texas and Arizona , after the States immig@@ ration laws had decided to re@@ locate people because of in@@ mig@@ rat@@ ations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U to further rein@@ forcement agencies .
passengers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in other countries but in the last time stak@@ eholders have used the measure to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU general assembly Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
at the rec@@ ess of the family of Schwen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ ach CDU @-@ local federation met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann initially granted in@@ sights into operation , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest far@@ med , 40 dairy cows and also many young ones looked after and in five apartments holiday houses .
the Black Forest &apos;s milk is for him the alternative @-@ less ver@@ ge path for the milk of its cows , so til@@ ting .
only regional trains come to the table of the Feri@@ nar@@ row@@ est .
since he is also the S@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the electric fence as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can not generate net income on this steep area .
the green economy has to be processed for much work , much has to be processed with the sense of the engine sense .
&quot; we have been busy here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; the pi@@ v@@ ot .
in 2003 he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead a bioci@@ de .
for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the municipality has recognised the significance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader promotion . &quot;
at cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers have to be supported .
we hope that the view of the areas could still be pulled out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , the people who are working in agriculture and are thought on how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ized the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area is thus 40 hectares that must not be stopped until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were funded , a quarter brought the village of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
in this way , the farmers were 12 610 euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ dem@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmer and land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are also best food for Peter White : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the regional direc@@ ting line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg facilit@@ ates the state grant of women .
the aim is to uph@@ old the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the bodies listed by L@@ PR .
in addition , the un@@ fenced area cannot be bo@@ iled ( hang@@ ar for over 35 per cent ) and must be at risk of view .
there is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would be located just under 16 km of fence .
the open surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump occupies the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate the same as every other - therefore the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he symbo@@ li@@ zes a symbolic occupation with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the Pre@@ sidents of the leg@@ ating Im@@ migration by the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself .
a Hor@@ de of Bo@@ bo@@ aters and Liberty immig@@ rants would have landed him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the significance that it was attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta shield : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively properly , but as he formulated it , it does not really get a story .
it is about the contemporary response to the raising words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your labor , your poor , and your poor masses , that seek after them to bre@@ athe freely , to bre@@ athe the el@@ bows of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time to see the &quot; el@@ usive tr@@ ash &quot; on our screens .
Miller did not work in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of its importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ front@@ ation : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they complete a very political action .
the sculpture should show connections between French and American Republi@@ can Rep@@ ublic@@ s by performing in an un@@ used classical depic@@ tion depic@@ ts female bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em , the female figure no longer abstract - it has a voice .
and she herself bears a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ em with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American extra vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to change from the right wing .
the big Schrei@@ h@@ than Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was argu@@ ed but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which brings the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going .
it should bear the fet@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something large .
the importance of the statue is quite and quite a question of a stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus , to see how they &apos;ve seen by the exhau@@ sted , el@@ ong@@ ation , but hop@@ eful people after long and often lost travelling on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from perspective of men that seek refuge and improve their chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome you must listen .
and this is of course not the perspective , that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to detect .
their tor@@ ch should not shine the way , but the hat@@ red , who is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black is the Scottish Members of the Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two sc@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom .
the performance director of the most athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 .
black believe that &quot; Scotland has developed something special in Scotland , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom has to learn out of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I Speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with him what they have done .
the Scottish athl@@ ete think that it has something to do with him what they have done .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road .
whatever is the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m circuit , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was promoted to become Captain of the team .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is rather modest .
their capit@@ als address was incredible &quot; says Black .
&quot; a row of athletes at no matter whether they were Scottish or train or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h has arrived quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver med@@ alli@@ sts that will compete for the fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m Hur@@ d@@ les , says it &quot; unbelievable &quot; is that 16 sc@@ ots are in the British team .
the total number of athletes at the World Championship was reached seven years in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mu@@ ir Middle distances leads on this path to five British and two European records last year .
you will participate at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was to keep the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the foreign capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her coun@@ try@@ men are not only a team , but in some cases , also in the medals and at the fin@@ alists .
&quot; the special about team chapter to be in it is that it was chosen by other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates have tuned for me and chose me to something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ dien .
what are my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it was good .
I have been pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
it is really important to put on this home language and take advantage of that we are at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will be simply as a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
critics of criticism on Facebook : do not exceed a public ministry when you cannot bear the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for anything , from the inner policy up to its political principles .
he swe@@ at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the year 1783 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech can be taken away , stup@@ id , and dum@@ b , we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an employees have blocks the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American National Liber@@ als Union commen@@ ded him in the beginning of this week .
the Staff of the govern@@ ors proposed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol , and the online commentary was full of an equivalent reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it &apos;s a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ishing .
he has the second su@@ preme approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand with the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and de@@ but@@ t his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons that come to the side of the governor - which is a public Forum which is officially designated and by employees who will be paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessary and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of control@@ l@@ able or h@@ ack@@ ing or h@@ ass@@ ful@@ s people using the p@@ ush@@ ers online .
the post spoke with some of the actual people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no t@@ roll .
they all told that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thinking and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ ly met , but she asked them to hate .
&quot; I comm@@ its pol@@ ite that I had disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; wrote in the commentary volume of the news &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I guess this idea even though a number of people regarding the same subject , then they will be ab@@ used as a so @-@ called collective application , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the other will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to as@@ sign a message by simply blocks a critic and deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time , if you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers with critical che@@ ating agents and to burn or burn dis@@ closures and to silence .
but exactly that happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants that critic@@ ises that he has imp@@ acted Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who have blocked from his Twitter Feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Board of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First A@@ moun@@ ts , according to US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is , at Alexandria , appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Before ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter ch@@ icks beat on his tour .
and even at that time , Washington was anonymous farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all of the letters written to newspapers and Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ized its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade , and shipping with Britain , over@@ took office , according to the historic documents published by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put it to silence .
speech : freedom , opinion , and dis@@ courses are part of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of local comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian is the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who conducted next to the Ar@@ kan@@ field left in the past year , before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , has been linked to the new venue and func@@ tioned as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame for this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a je@@ ure suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really especially , &quot; said the player in South@@ port together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open what she won in the year after I won them from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to that part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to its home .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance at Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more to play when you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you &apos;ll notice this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trio on the field is the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ ker@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ER .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup team captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sc@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ bra@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .

less lung cancer separated by passive smoke
over the past two decades , less people are dying due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
the result of the researchers at the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoke per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Department of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he went to an own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were 400 lung cancer cases available due to passive smoking annually in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; .
household connections have a very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger road are in full swing and &quot; lie with reas@@ on@@ ably in time &quot; so the director of the train station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the situation is more complicated than thought , as in the Under@@ ground a lot of mountains , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which again handic@@ apped the construction work , represents a large problem for part ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already enorm@@ ously &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the line busses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working with works on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; the hot days were pretty good .

of course there may be late too hard work : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are here the soldiers .
&quot; nobody said it , after 17 o &apos; clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a less insight into the daily life of the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken after a controversi@@ al referendum in 1969 , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched the Dutch rule , turned back against the government of Jakarta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or dispute .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so far as a desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ ale 5 @-@ hour drive with car hire .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o f@@ ences , and from corrugated boards that were m@@ illed by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indonesia made their journey back here , because journalists and practically no foreigners recruited .
before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .

&quot; earlier we had only leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ast@@ est in the province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates have in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ze Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at an estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these rich@@ ness , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military keeps a fir@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 had paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 150,000 in a single official .
Pap@@ u@@ an claims under greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated for mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped out by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s gen@@ eric @-@ land in the 1970 @-@ he years were condemned to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region .
&quot; we are reading everything &quot; in a report of the arch@@ di@@ ö@@ dioc@@ ese of Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities committed in the previous year are particularly popular as unknown Hin@@ ts and torture - rape and electro@@ stim@@ ulation are peaceful demonstrations of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since any week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
these screws have bol@@ stered as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % of Christian , but dem@@ ographic development changes , as Muslim populations of the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi come .

&quot; the migrants have started to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has been the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his elec@@ toral campaign in 2014 , ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ ing@@ ement of the Pap@@ ua .
former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has little changed , and today the loc@@ als feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
actually , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ owski &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the rock@@ ed children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a violation of her sound , and later returned with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued the group with their hin@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers injured in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uss@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set fire on fire and the things were es@@ cal@@ ed on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young par@@ rot men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch before the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they contributed hunting Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ lover - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to cut stones in police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have put more than three resistance , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it was dead in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called the crowd and called for a lot to return home .
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was shot suddenly into my left hand , he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden building .
k@@ ay@@ ak still don &apos;t know who fired everyone , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the number of soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was over crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; add it .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , his c@@ ousin who was the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure that it was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who bears as many In@@ don@@ ier just a name , the TI@@ ME in the dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ er@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to secure her station , &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend us when people are threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ gi@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the che@@ ers came first day &apos; filtered &apos; in Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies to the families of the victims and s@@ ware to go to the historical failure of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I would like to solve this case immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
Secretary of Justice Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the dispute of historical human rights violations .
but the emig@@ ration began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries are before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to stop these cl@@ ashes , but there are processes that have to go through , &quot; he said .
then , W@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta , and said , He has no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which demanded the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; claimed that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre @-@ incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims contributed such claims with the fur@@ ther@@ ing un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; I inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the Military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting mur@@ als have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring an conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unken when he explo@@ ited in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
crow@@ ded vill@@ agers in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who responded by using warning notes .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the amount and killing one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we are afraid that there is ven@@ geance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who was living near the hospital and was a witness as the past here was the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to withdraw the officers to the account and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trou@@ blem@@ ish for Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many of the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ir@@ onic Army , claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by providing spor@@ adi@@ es attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some do never go again .
under the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai known as &quot; a trag@@ ical , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just beside range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture remains the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
you will keep the majority of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of emer@@ gen@@ cies are only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic im@@ balance between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport has arrived in greater number .
the few jobs that are in the region are usually taken out to the better formed and prosp@@ erous migran@@ t .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , limitations of reporting international media are cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , even though the rare permission was given for movies .
according to ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to promote restrictions on coverage to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new d@@ angers for foreign journalists are trying to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ze un@@ tran@@ qui@@ ous provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure is limited to the Indonesian government to be limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ pped states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and well @-@ known injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to dis@@ regard the evidence for human rights .
people want to know that more foreign governments should consider this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , on May 4 , broke loc@@ als , and op@@ pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source that participated in the session but anonymous .
Indonesia to see a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua is likely that they will probably be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who participated in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the Chairman of the Executive Board .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant thre@@ ats of a burning military , is located in poor educ@@ ators and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; says he .
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ti@@ bles , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sh@@ uss@@ ings offer a symbolic act of symbolic terms : the dead body was buried on an area opposite the police and the military station .
they don &apos;t know that perhaps this will never come to justice , but at least she did not forget her crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a down@@ cast head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai on the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 337 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings .
it is the second fire that leads through the high tower in just two years , it is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries no reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we are buried during fire alarm and write the people .
we burned down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50 floor to the bottom , &quot; telling a resident who named his name as George , Reuters .
Dubai &apos;s Civil Protection Act said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 : 00 GMT ) and the building cooled down .
the government said that they work on the provision of accommodation for the affected areas .
the incident can be used to ensure safety of materials , which are used in outdoor buildings around the world , revi@@ ve .
an investigation conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for isol@@ ating insulation and clothing at the London Gren@@ om Tower in June could have contributed to the spread of a fire of fire , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis federation ( IT@@ F ) is talking with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city , the one for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not only supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact that is often very long , but also a very estimated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs will remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the countries voted for reform the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore just barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
it will continue to work to improve the application .
not until the vote was not before , after a lot of obj@@ ections , the final occurred on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor detail : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host to host this year in the first round of the year .
to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete any official media events in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forth items into the plane , finds a survey
a survey carried out under flight pass@@ words revealed that more than 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or inde@@ struc@@ tive items contributed to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that were able to guess by aircraft , while it acci@@ dentally carried out knives or other items with clin@@ ches .
less than 1 percent said they were delayed that they had to have er@@ ron@@ g@@ ably with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition , or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey on more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers are rather mis@@ chief against the rules .
of the respon@@ dents agreed that they have been trying to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of Generation X were .
the most common objects which were lab@@ elled on T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have borne items contributed by the security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents were also confirmed that they would have been deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that I inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally would have done wis@@ ely in the airport and how many are deliber@@ ately done .
it &apos;s not a surprise that people who carry the most frequently sm@@ ug@@ n@@ ally - know or invisible - by security , those who were most frequently .
however , the company indicates that T@@ SA directives are slightly complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often in@@ secure that fluids may take them and how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of items linked by T@@ SA are prohibited .
a long time thought the people , the T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ customers order
electric @-@ Taus@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has so far sub@@ du@@ ed that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its current reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers to increase sales and more , Tesla @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has betrayed the announcement of the latest quartet balance for the first time a different , less glorious figure : that the cancellations made for the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often earned more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in the past few months , whose extra@@ dition is scheduled .
there is a dream : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 were already withdrawn .
critics often pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; booking payment &quot; complete .
currently 45@@ 5,000 of such suggested reservations are currently available , in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
however , the cancellation of so far had about twelve percent of all orders to be solved , the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production page .
last year , Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models have been taken together - 500,000 to be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations for one day .
those who now order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered with delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla creates its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never ever tested in the practice of tested production lines with maximum utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the im@@ pet@@ iti@@ vity of reservations will be a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot accept dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ de moves to reduce emissions , due to the execution of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ fought , the Chief of the Environment Protection Agency , his former decision to delayed the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ ked air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ ster presented change , as its agency demonstrated the needs of state environmental authorities , compared to present actions faster than previous sub@@ missions .
he did not mention the complaint that was imposed against his prior spot in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it is a deadline that expired on 1 October for States to keep the standards of 2015 for floor ozone .
P@@ ru@@ ster announced in June that he will provide compliance with a year in order to study more time to study the plan and to avoid the plan in local decisions , or learning economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ ster , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was long time a reliable opponent &apos;s environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ ster has been repeated to block or delayed , to block the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ al regulatory run@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Appeals Court decided that the EPA tra@@ ded its authority in Washington as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies on monitoring and reducing Me@@ thane Le@@ cks to be delayed .
during a Wednesday evening review , P@@ ru@@ de found that his reduction in ozone @-@ standards very simply beat the read@@ iness of the EPA in cooperation with the states through the complex process of performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on earlier sub@@ missions , the EPA often have not kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to have been accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement the date of implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ fought , who co @-@ accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by trial , and we do me@@ at@@ ern@@ st .
we also use the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ fought eventually his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal rights provided , &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress condu@@ its on a more thor@@ ough new version of ozone rules .
a bill in the last month of approval is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who had led the Coalition in this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and those over 115 million Americans that flows directly from Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ ville , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil ozone does not result , if pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting Smo@@ g can cause serious bre@@ aching problems and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .
representatives of the public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ al surprise course exchange .
&quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the person responsible for the protection of the air that we in@@ hale &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cross of the Tr@@ ump government to cont@@ am@@ inate environmental contamination and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche Church , the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm to a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyl@@ lic situation and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their investment .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique jewe@@ l . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Würt@@ tem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical Ur@@ du @-@ language : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the following parish church at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document based on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there is also a splendid courtyard , too which belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ or law and not vice vers@@ a .
so also people lived there .

society wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal foundation for construction and has therefore already turned on the land council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim f@@ ights &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
it may be illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette even had been approved for wind turbines , since the time in quadru@@ sen only exists at the bound@@ ary border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city area .
the different zones must prevent a &quot; prevention &quot; of the landscape .
although a few days earlier had decided by a change of the surface plan of a second wind power concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette - but the Düsseldorf District government had not been approved because of a mol@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of approval is the approval of approval according to the illegal and thus decre@@ asing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the City Council again decided in front of the summer break again the wind con@@ cent@@ ric zone at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; encour@@ agement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the division of approval for the erection of wind turbines is prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respective writing have been received since last week at the district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the reason to verify the matter .
it is not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the ongoing trial at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday wanted to be in@@ sof@@ tened with the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette to build four per 200 meters high winds .
already last year , the company , which took part in the city , quadru@@ pled , with the owner of the app@@ ra@@ isal of about 65 hectares .
with the erection of the four wind turbines , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 households - that equ@@ ates to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Lin@@ ni@@ ch &apos;s wind farm in Aachen , and a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbine plant in Ober@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .

Tr@@ ump replaced by telephone call by telephone call Mexico under pressure on the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone call between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Leadership of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on , to qu@@ it public , publicly that he would not pay for a planned wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President contra@@ cted him , because he publicly tra@@ cted the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ tables were also published and unveiled a cl@@ amped replacement .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Bull that a trade for the United States refugees who emigrated to Australia , &quot; is sm@@ iling and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence of the government , who would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban of res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told the Lord Turn@@ st@@ ature , &quot; that is the most common call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for righteousness again
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury launched a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ inking into the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , joined a group of white men with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train to its cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ shield .
inside the inside the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
in torn , the silence is torn as a young black man from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this awesome scene was played , which was played on the 22nd of July , only a reproduction .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them died in the audience very real sig@@ h .
since 2005 , Mayor of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge has been back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged because of the murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really un@@ speak@@ able that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we know them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s who helps in the organization of the re@@ classification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it &apos;s a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brook@@ s is a former member of the State of Georgia and a life long lasting 71 @-@ year @-@ old .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for action and represents a annual memory of the Monroe @-@ community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to finish , we want to be healed , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of directors depic@@ ts a blank@@ et on the ly@@ re of a victim of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch , July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but none were ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on free foot since decades , civil rights said that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia enabled the black citizens of Georgia to leave their vote for the first time in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white property owner , bar@@ bell H@@ ester , while a struggle is supp@@ ressed because of a woman .
Brook@@ s said the report was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy and that the baby , she bore not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , called the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she turned away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge was coming to a car surrounded by Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it emerged , Har@@ rison , who prepared the mor@@ sel , and ordered that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in murder , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brook@@ s formul@@ ates it still form@@ able .
&quot; it was a vot@@ er massacre , &quot; said he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this commun@@ ion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual report of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is descrip@@ tive , p@@ am@@ end and is justified in a type of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he doesn &apos;t exist in America .
it is difficult to see and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are being con@@ fron@@ ted with Him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot answer any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen of white and the rest black - in a room and in wait , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enb@@ Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief @-@ cl@@ an@@ kl@@ ist since years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to receive this story in life because we didn &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ester @-@ scre@@ ams and ur@@ ged him , w@@ asted that he slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ishing from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona answer the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in a guard .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; I asked S@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene still said goo@@ d@@ ently .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think the white people were at that time &quot; n --- &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; swe@@ at one of the other black dar@@ es .
&quot; you must pay only the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that &apos;s exactly what the energy is moving in the room , a sense of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy with it , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time if Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh .
this repet@@ ition is working and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , kiss@@ es and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a dress @-@ dress , stands above the course of actors and leads cheap holidays of &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
their voice breaks out with each second word .
about one hundred meters , a group of about four dozen people were caught in swe@@ at , and tears from eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down to the street .
they witnessed nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as afflicted moisture , when Brook@@ s leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de stayed there , but now , if you come on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de sat down , the air feels .
if the last score of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ecting the dead name .
children ho@@ cks in their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; he mur@@ mu@@ red by a little boy , when he would remember it .
after some minutes there were gre@@ ed the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ne arrow and w@@ anting its tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , which the Cl@@ an member has played .
Nick Ras@@ pers@@ erv@@ ed two of his fellow players and then he breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
the audience later puts together with the actors to the dinner together .
in a table pl@@ au@@ ded a white pair of Atlanta on the reproduction with a black pair which they have just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was about to find words which he has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of the people who look like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it work with me , believe me that the Lyn@@ es still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the only police shooting is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s Hof on his desk , he e@@ ats and commemor@@ ates the rights of civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the replica is inspir@@ ing , because it describes the terror of what we have borne , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we learn it from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not know his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is sentenced to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf has set a colourful production of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the shooting platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an isolated street corner with a wall and a D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from East times or the New York Stock Exchange .
previously , an open Mercedes @-@ vintage car , which the Rhine dead@@ lines are pos@@ ing off as Rock@@ erg@@ ear@@ ls , or alternatively a is@@ etta .
mol@@ ted oil dispens@@ ers remin@@ is@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs gui@@ ding principle - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; Ins@@ aging .
the three Rhine dead@@ lines - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
according to Stefan Vin@@ ke , Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a Ly@@ che into the trunk in the trunk , put it into the boot space and give the wall@@ pap@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing s@@ ings the del@@ ight@@ ful professional Hagen , surrounded the au@@ ra of a heavy weight @-@ box@@ er .

later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must also believe .
the audience ab@@ dic@@ ts the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my , F@@ ost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski decided to dress her hands and hands to the Merkel rob@@ ber@@ y .
great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the large heat again in Leg@@ erer recre@@ ational clothing .
with tension un@@ expect@@ edly the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and its direc@@ et@@ eam was expected .
in 2013 , he still had to leave the pipe concert for the Pfei@@ f@@ concert , five years later , in which the cov@@ eted &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; -@@ Ru@@ fe went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ky Katharina Wagner is set to be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we noted that the audience grew up with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ at , but it is also a understanding of his vision .
I go a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers .
they work in their volunte@@ er year immediately at several locations .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture style , I help to stay in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked at school in open all day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum , that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so is a late professional volunte@@ er .
how does this come ?
quantity : I have made high school education .
and then a civil engineering studies , let &apos;s say successfully , successfully stopped .
I recognized for myself that it &apos;s the gro@@ ove and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself , what do you do .
once a social year , there is an insight , as you can see , as it is on site , in the burning point maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social industry in the winter semester .
I will be dual , and probably in the youth office Her@@ ne will make a social worker and study at the Fachhochschule Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different operating locations throughout the volunte@@ er service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it &apos;s always coming to , where to make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the age to youth - in all sor@@ rows of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partially in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , this was the right , what prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really is going on .
other than in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , here it will not be to calculate date .
one has always got another person long , each of which have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , a youth that has been taken out of the family - one must always be going to respond individually .
very interesting .
and they had no contact information ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
much love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but this is that life .

EPA returns to de@@ cel@@ eration of the Smo@@ g rule after pl@@ agues
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted a decision to delay a regulation of government of Obama , dis@@ si@@ ent that the states are obliged to in@@ hibit Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States compl@@ ained the Agency because of the step@@ per stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to describe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the obligation of agency , together with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our government partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ fought in a Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt was announced to the intention of the EPA - which must be measured in a part of the Country of pollutants , in order to determine where inser@@ tions are to be kept to delayed by a stric@@ ter air quality standards - to be delayed until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental conditions that avo@@ ids the former president Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that will boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the feedback of the Democrats and nature groups that concerns themselves about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EP@@ O website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , which contains ozone @-@ contains &quot; the lung function and ampli@@ fy the respiratory symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma .
Municipal Council wants to be common
at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds decides on the establishment of a common room in the future field of seniors .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of land was signed , the mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reported .
although it is still going to last until the community of the church is owned , but there is no plan of planning for the project by a private investor .
there is a discussion in regard to a Community Area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space of approximately 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council before , such a common room is not just a meeting place for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ ous living , but open to the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision that has already been decided by the provision for the current budget has already been decided in the last autumn by providing funding .
the construction is in the san@@ itation area .
the establishment of a Community area would be reported that T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible .
the decision to sign@@ alize the need to sign@@ alled that in this regard , no bil@@ lets between the legs I want to en@@ close it - as well as a separate roof - what the tr@@ ampl@@ itude is reduced and the construction of the construction makes it possible .
not necessarily , so does not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be the addition .
when it helps : unanimously he passes the panel .
it is not as simple as the common room .
Daniela Com@@ or@@ ted to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t come so right now , that is back in common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do not do me to do so . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind the hidden payout to coh@@ er@@ able or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area one should not give you a supplement , but get a real , in case of market @-@ market@@ able counter@@ point , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ er Application , the decision to split the decision , finds three fears .
so , with two counter@@ parts at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ize : &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step there , to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : Rad@@ ler is mounted on road
at the qu@@ el@@ ter of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cyclists had been captured by car in Gar@@ ath by car and was seriously wounded .
like the police , 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ e@@ fields was driving around 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the road road of the Black road from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road to the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
one in the same direction of driving passenger car driver granted him preced@@ ence .
when the landing fields proce@@ eded to the road , he obviously did not beat on the other way .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was sh@@ ined on the street .
he suffered heavy injuries and was brought to a hospital in a hospital .

for the five defe@@ ats in the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the body condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes on a performance increase in the first official round of season .
&quot; soccer is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows this qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more difficult , intensive game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attrac@@ ts fans in their hat@@ s .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) divided on Friday .
w@@ ander up the star in the Harz Mountains star
in the Harz , the nationwide &quot; star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to be created nationwide .
this is planning the club ob@@ servatory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there are also a planet track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
one &quot; star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; to meet the information needs of many harp visitors , it was called .
he connector nature , science , movement , and spor@@ tive performance .
members want to set up panels along the planned route boards and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
during the first phase to 2018 the association &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations for five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ eiß Ri@@ vers and Sie@@ ber .
information on the panels should be supplemented by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network receiving a role in the location selection .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the Star @-@ pf@@ ad train station is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn a lot of knowledge about the con@@ gest@@ ation path , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned what stars could have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is essentially a fly away .
also , in which constellation may be given a selected star , and when he is best to see .
the association has been running since 2014 in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated ob@@ servatory in northern Germany .
the centre of the National Park in the middle of the National Park is one of the figures for nature conservation in the six dark regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way galax@@ y and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with blo@@ oms eye clearly visible .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt since 2003 , there has been something similar to the initiative of the Association of plan@@ et@@ arium with the planned star cluster .
beginning in front of Prayer Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planet leads up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; alien &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community of Gl@@ eichen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the poles with the individual planets - including the plan@@ ked Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the gap and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun up to Pl@@ u@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need an hour to stand with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who are in a coll@@ age course to direct the most exciting Box@@ fight in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the proposed World Box@@ ing Council Ligh@@ tweight Design Champion , the corridor went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as win by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighter members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und List .
Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How do you go , champion ?
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Th@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the pair of photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I asc@@ ended for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so large .
I am small for 140 .
I want to draw on the lightweight weight .
and he must move in light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted to .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot;
climate as asked if it should have been fighting on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy to sign the Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to sign up the winner against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed later open to fight over the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he said to Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; an enormous mil@@ it@@ ant , &quot; and perhaps he will participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o kept the generous praise of Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Thir@@ ty champion from River@@ side was &quot; very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to see the K@@ o @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus is , stroke strength , then boxes .
they both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which he built for their own battle .
&quot; this is the fight that needs to be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said , &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
there will be a great struggle . &quot;
four latest types of tire boards
in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously wounded in the afternoon .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost at 4.@@ 30 p.m. , shortly before the connection station market , probably after a tyre plat@@ ter control over his vehicle .
the passenger car moved to the right into the f@@ ake , where he survived , and then lying on the roof in the grass .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded in the accident .
during the initial supply of the past by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 towards the north was locked in for about one hour , then traffic on the left strip on the left direction should be settled .
Fort@@ is Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing after the 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er to Braunschweig so that the optimization of the def@@ ensive information will bring points to Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , would not be the two opponents with the 2 : 2 in Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were two opponents in much , and we have to watch in au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotary chain should also be optimised further .
and a fool according to a post@@ ure do not want to sei@@ ze any further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that none else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the rotating chain than with the square chain .
&quot; even if I don &apos;t know what we will act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure , &quot; because we just have just in the rotating chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; says Hoffmann .
&quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t aff@@ ord to make a lot of ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
of course Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you int@@ end to talk about a bad start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the achievement could be okay . &quot; he said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can focus on Sunday with four points and can be concentr@@ ating on the t@@ rophy , we will certainly be able to talk about an ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight playing days , Fried@@ helm funk , who would not like to talk about an advantage against au@@ e , just because the game of the Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can begin to kick off their season like a home game , &quot; said Radio and Hoffmann actually believe that players from Au@@ e might be even some fr@@ inge , since they could have no heavier and complete game like Fortuna against a level of asc@@ ension into the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know that 100 percent where they are standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests come from the Rhineland as easier favorite on Sunday to the encounter in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have taken them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd division , which one must hit from the out@@ set , &quot; explains the coach coach .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and over@@ lifting . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his poker players on Sunday .
new results published in the Swedish As@@ yl@@ age evaluation tests published
the youngest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ ddle Dep@@ in@@ et ) has started with the implementation of tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ations@@ Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) were critic@@ ized for lack of the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ ors of age .
until today mig@@ r@@ ations@@ .@@ 6.@@ 880 is sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to the 31st of July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency determined that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 the conclusion was that the person is &apos; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only performed in cases where the person &apos;s age is question@@ ed .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ v@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a great difference in the statistics of last months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local .
the high percentage of cases where the person has been judged more than 18 years , means that the asylum seek@@ ers has weighed about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and told that it would be 4@@ 42 cases that the fact that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person said frank@@ ly , that she may become 18 years old .
the method of medical age condem@@ nation , in the x @-@ ray recordings of wisdom teach@@ ings , and MRI recordings are analysed , which are then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a rop@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work includes the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were earlier or later as usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could say , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ v@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child is un@@ correct as an adult .
the greatest risk lies in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is roughly 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in the time it is super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ manager at the Department of Stre@@ am@@ ers and Transport in the Government Bureau in Freiburg .
in April the work began simultaneously on all three restoration bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is certain that the schedule will hold the schedule .
the first bridge , coming by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault dam , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of Red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve and respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ ins on Wednesday .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as an operating way .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian path takes place .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ ener .
particular finger@@ tips has the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected there .
the residents were informed of this project in advance of the project .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ w@@ fish had to be cut off .
for the bridges between the buildings and the collecting conveyor in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ track is governed by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher Center is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotels &quot; Tann@@ ery &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; in the bridge .
the cost of the three bridge posts will amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ less Protest at the German potato salad
it is not so often that parties go to a strand , but when it goes around the alternative to Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to bring to a hat .
the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance that shows peace@@ fully flag in this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to post a poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who forms the peak duo with Alexander Gau@@ land on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already before the event at the beginning of the event will not want to listen to the Af@@ D men but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city pic@@ nic place under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well @-@ place , but is now on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the author@@ itarian organis@@ ers , really happy : &quot; great , how many people are joined here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ gently potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ak , &quot; says the woman who brought him away .
the Police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein . it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the locations .
how did the Af@@ D came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vol@@ cano tells us that he was trying to have such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ ch no enough parking is available .
well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ ant@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various Red@@ ner , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ an Af@@ D president Uwe Young .
there are about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting to wait for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their Spe@@ ech@@ es .
the police show remains unchanged , but so far the civil servants had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour is the Af@@ D event that guests have a longer breath , but also there is more shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the Police can reserve - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one strikes trumpet
a re @-@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ onist Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; hits a classic German training with roots in the bladder .
both solo@@ ists are the winners and the winners of numerous international competitions and have a solo@@ ist in European leading orchestra orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ rom@@ p@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the lust , not only the limits on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the various gen@@ res .
in the two way , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz Musi@@ cian , mix together classic , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall art work .
this piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg in spring with huge success .
the renowned composer Nils W@@ ORD has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special Ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ics is consci@@ ously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed and they will eat it until the end of her life .
but I want to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart has completely openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I hit again in gr@@ illed cheese I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celebr@@ ities was that of her &quot; tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , eventually went out bitter .
despite all this covered the Brün@@ ing Dar@@ stell@@ ress from the Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in every serious heart that I had been involved .
or believe you about , I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , they gave it bis@@ exual , saying , &quot; I have ever lived for du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it has never conf@@ used , or ham@@ per@@ ed me .
I never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
it was particularly successful , according to &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , when they loved one Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really has really viol@@ ated me .
when I was eleven , the children said to me , I would look like a b@@ b .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and damaged .
now I &apos;m back and consider me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
particularly the public , they don &apos;t like to live their love story : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and off@@ end me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps I may believe me some as und@@ ank@@ ful , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have been removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic Govern@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement by the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ sed the Democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice that according to Forbes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes report that he owns carbon@@ em@@ ins in five countries , and has inher@@ ited a carbon business from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the Party of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather fly to us to make our country another great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 g@@ no@@ ons and the f@@ ew@@ est laws in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel &apos;s R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel &apos;s R@@ onna News in a Declaration called C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E awards &quot; hon@@ est &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al
the worldwide chief of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ te on Thursday , what he described as an evident withdrawal from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ actic ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of the athlet@@ ics World Championships on the eve of his country out of sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that I felt sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were cut in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress approved for maintaining the ban in November 2015 , after a report in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found information on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress was very pleased that the Russian Federation has witnessed itself in itself , that they experienced some rather hot times , and everything will do to make sure the Federation is newly designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said that he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia did not accept the criteria for his re @-@ deployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very design day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize the situation .
the console principle was always that we wanted to separate the Clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are competing with the athlet@@ ics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setup .
drug tests are still ongoing and forbidden Trainer is still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

doub@@ ts about the UN mission in Mali was not shown by the Ley@@ la : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated from two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik talked about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk p@@ ush@@ es instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .

&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the Parliament resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising leaves of a Green MPs from their land@@ day in Lower Saxony had overcome the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover won their cris@@ p majority vote in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets established her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .

until now the ratio was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on 14th January .
Th@@ ings@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could re@@ signs in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil keeps it to an indisp@@ ens@@ able that the national day as soon as possible decides to resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU faction will probably be announced on Tuesday through her next day .
the national survey also provides the possibility that the Parliament president will elect the trust of the Prime Minister and elect a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ ri@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will have respect to all questions , if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green M@@ EP@@ s in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ason to voters and voters but also betra@@ y@@ al on red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the sigh@@ ed eggs .
how did the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editing network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumer protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumer to check the eggs in your refrigerator accurately and check the stamp printing .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the provinces represent the latest information about the affected egg @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we are presently know , health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central part of the Federal Minister of Agriculture will not really be true ?
food monitoring is the role of federal states .
however , my house has to be immediately switched on and since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s data in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturer to ensure that the selling products are transport and health @-@ harmful health .
if in the case of eggs , the resistance level of 0.000@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time are not the local farms .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the ze@@ al level of knowledge , production companies are no immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , they must count due to mut@@ in@@ ally illegal practices of service firms with economic damage .
how always there are too little check in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or also at the sle@@ ev@@ ous jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which have uncovered the process .
however , the fact that food was never ceased to be 100 percent excluded from food and criminal energy .
therefore , a consistent adv@@ ent of such events and the hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be found , of crucial importance .
I have already made several times that I expect a gap @-@ free access by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sk@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get a safe and effective food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is deployed , consumer women and consumers are distur@@ bed .
by the dispos@@ ed means , manufacturers , merchants and consumers are advised to a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des fi@@ de in particular cannot be settled and must be concluded prom@@ pt@@ ly .
it has to be consistently and worked with high @-@ pressure on all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities to clari@@ fy the atomic fact and will be clari@@ fied .
how the football rules of football matches on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of the European football , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain for UEFA EURO , because the conduc@@ tive organisation , which monitors the European game , has power to pro@@ hibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA EURO , means that PS@@ G will point out sometime , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazil out of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to several 10 million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moved to France .
PS@@ G can also make money loose with security in order to make Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the teams by the energy @-@ rich Herr@@ sh@@ al family of Qatar .
associations may apply for the purchase of players a lot of money , but have to control the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related shop .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that , in their course they had had enormous debt in their streaming , effective and ris@@ ed to recru@@ it , if banks or owner returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P dropped from the concentration on the monitoring of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used originally in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and to build a global mark - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year shift period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ ine continues to break from over@@ time issues .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we are going to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA EURO , opposite The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out @-@ clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice of the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the total amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million will be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G joined together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be restricted to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to persu@@ ade their financial advis@@ ors by combining their revenues by companies dealing with the owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ astroph@@ ic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not apply as a leg@@ it@@ onal income .
it was in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar for the 2022 organis@@ ational committee .
however , PS@@ G and Qatar of 2022 participated that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be able to find out and could find a real man@@ oeu@@ vre that could be just out of the UEFA European regulatory authorities .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more attention , each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no prepared talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , speaking on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they are not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s will pay a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing Deals , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ting .
the Club assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish league was definitely irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to go , and she tried to stop N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by saying that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to the Legislative Decree of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sports car ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state to finance a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because there are different ways or different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sc@@ og@@ gil@@ ant in Search
in the past few years Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate was produced for the Swiss .
now the cute co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline has re@@ signs the contract .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the News Agency S@@ DA , a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed and subjected to quality control every two to three years .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current suppliers Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said spokes@@ woman .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white plastic packs are distributed to 14 grams a year , the flight atten@@ dant to passengers .
beyond the cost , Swiss did not want to do any information .
industry in@@ sider estimate the order volume under &quot; North Western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for one og@@ gi@@ gi@@ es , it is a pre@@ stige mission .
as many applic@@ ants in the new call , the Swiss will not be betrayed .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper article Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to keep a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss Life since 2006 on board of its flights .
before the Swiss completed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut plant has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with H@@ ug &apos;s chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo between two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y .

nost@@ al@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ alg@@ ically due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge era ( as the pre@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age the Sk@@ etch &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a sal@@ es@@ per@@ ation of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories .
but it feels like fran@@ chise , the time it would scar@@ cely be .
&quot; first Day of camp &quot; was sur@@ pris@@ ingly good , not only because of its ab@@ sur@@ ing bum@@ per ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by being able to grow at the core of the week@@ day - actor medium @-@ age children , they become adult - they nevertheless created the im@@ possibility to return the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotional and his par@@ ody looks like more after the fo@@ undry &apos;s movies of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( hand the cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a point there is a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , a few in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now roman@@ aut@@ or , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ ility .
and there is another crazy bo@@ oming plot that is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) who is now supported by George H.@@ W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the exchange rates are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Under@@ li@@ pp@@ et of &quot; Singles &quot; shows , whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old bu@@ zz@@ ler .
there are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ns that this fran@@ chise might heat like a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene is showing the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds us of a different kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : at the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ west Ring I@@ con@@ ography .

blow to drugs Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest circle , in Rot@@ a@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects , as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s prosec@@ utor took place on Friday .
15 years of age , under the age of 25 and 77 , the arrest warran@@ ts have been arrested and issued warran@@ ts for the arrest warrant .
in addition , the officers of mar@@ i@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros were safe .
in the same raid , there were two persons arrested in Italy .
there was a German arrest warran@@ ts issued against the two susp@@ ects .
therefore the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Mafia is being organized drug de@@ crimin@@ ality , violent crimes , trans@@ duc@@ ted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and tor@@ ment .
already since the summer of 2016 the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance against the organised drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in the South German room .
between the prosec@@ utor in Constance and Palermo was a lively and investig@@ ator of Kri@@ po Rot@@ a@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
the big deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the vis@@ or of the investigations , primarily Italian citizens were primarily linked to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident happened on the 27th of May in Cust@@ oms , where several shots were fired up in a restaurant in the early morning , is likely to go to the band &apos;s account .
manner compl@@ ained big g@@ aps in the alien li@@ ds
&quot; data of citizens not to dive &quot; : a report shows the fore@@ igner register in Germany significant short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has said atten@@ tive to a media report to large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s can@@ did@@ st register .
short@@ com@@ ings in the cases registered with asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ ce@@ ful mis@@ decisions &quot; in an analysis based on the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; in an analysis .
according to the regi@@ sters , 10 million people are identified with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million out of non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because data is not suff@@ iciently cared for , the data quality in parts have not been well done so far .
in individuals , data from 1921 was found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who are a German citizen and no more to appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ective data players can slow down recur@@ rent processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a reference to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on immig@@ ration people , the EU citizens must have been recorded , which would not have to travel .
but such false assign@@ ments , however , led to a debate on the handling of expul@@ sion , &quot; is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ sent Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it means that B@@ AM@@ F will conduct such procedure &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1st of June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was no longer possible to find the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first .
when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ ration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds write the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the total capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave up for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) will be sufficient for further information .
other EU countries would also send a refugee within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal policy spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : for families with children , thre@@ aten in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a companion of the childhood . &quot;

a total of 220 liters of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already been a group of bleeding for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens were awarded on Friday .

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation would have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulations about an increase .
the Bank of England war@@ ns that economic growth will remain , when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision makers ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in their quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and war@@ ned that inflation would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but they sign@@ alized that in the coming years of interest rate , inflation would be breeding , and she said that the loan cost might be more than expected to rise to financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth @-@ economic package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it is expected to provide time for the financial plan to al@@ locate from the coming February cheaper financing to banks , although it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of MP@@ C the gross domestic product ( GDP ) will be weak in short time , as pressure on the re@@ union of households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to drop down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dimension than the markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets forecast for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
the Bank , however , stressed that increases &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limits . &quot;
according to the revised growth forecast for this year &apos;s forecast for this year &apos;s next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % were projected .
she has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after this news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the most recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have risen , increasing expectations to a interest increase and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and mar@@ vel@@ ous sal@@ aries , as the deep@@ ening is first even worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy must not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , resulting in a part of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision will take a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU tuning , which caused the sin@@ king of the coup .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until these prices and the economy will be fully reached .
prior to the last convic@@ tion of the Bank , the call increased after an interest rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July increased to 0.5 % in July .
inflation fell to 2.6 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to return to the next few months .
the Bank said that its aims at the ratio to their target of 2 % be &quot; quite &quot; the weak pound . &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ acci@@ o , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market might want to be more competitive once , since the loan has to be looking very strong for shops and the year in a positive way .
the market looks very good for those where the existing contracts run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health service ) shall disp@@ oss@@ ess HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed HIV pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one in front of the sexual activity recorded pre@@ valent sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) who can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , now being supplied by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the process , after the Court of Appeal confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court in which the N@@ HS had confirmed the case , in spite of the alleg@@ ation that the local authorities should finance him .
on Thursday , the Chess Federation has been announced by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) , as the &quot; decisive moment &quot; at the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) .
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in April 2018 .
pre@@ emin@@ ence sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( P@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduced the HIV transmission in inf@@ ection mode significantly .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medic@@ ations can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come to question for the treatment include g@@ ays or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in the best clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered in an in@@ dent@@ ist may also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program is signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines during this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study aims to evaluate the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical documents , as well as in large scale it is made specifically and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this large new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in awareness of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if there are targeted and end@@ angered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidem@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really being controlled and does not have a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to many of many lives .
we welcome all this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority is now on that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now because the Pr@@ EP test medicine has been described , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , sh@@ adows , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to months after months of delay and due to the government welcome and over@@ due .
the evidence show how trans@@ forming these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and finish the transmission of those life @-@ changing infection .
this trial brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible in the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to a step closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and smart designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former banking board with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed their bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I kept myself in love and made a bid that day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square feet was completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - do Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine add to use the spacious deck height optimally .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , to create a 12.5 foot high ceilings and a home not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ rides , so that the architectural challenge consisted of a mezzanine to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the pre@@ ference .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were over@@ thrown one another , without that we had to g@@ aps to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just the way to build a single platform , but put out the steel that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us is looking down via the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge mou@@ ille set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance offer mir@@ ro@@ red units place for all the no@@ bles and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glorious room , the beauty of the living room does not include the kitchen when it is not used .
hing@@ ed kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of repairs went in , &quot; the fan explains of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposite , so that if you p@@ ush@@ es out the door , it is very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , extra bed and improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agents is entering a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials to make the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; materials are the things you touch and who are therefore helping to create a emotional li@@ aison in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric power sockets in walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself by good design and increased square meter of something standard in something quite aston@@ ishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brothers Fight for a 500 million US dollar estate imperi@@ al
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y in a con@@ front@@ ation because of one of the largest real estate im@@ per@@ ia Victoria &apos;s worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its assets are split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation about the separation is held in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have collected 38 real estate valued at over half a billion dollars , since the family managed to store a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
the family West@@ co Je@@ ans established there and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
the property has been investing in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now has offices in the urban center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Colin returned from Paul as &quot; chief operators and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the business abroad and Paul roughly one third .
a place of jurisdiction states that Colin is owned by the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a pro@@ spect@@ acle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ess@@ ess@@ ments of Colin have left him with the left of what I did for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed appro@@ ving the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice was held .
the brothers are now fighting for the control of existing business , Colin , as Paul claimed to have him excluded .
Colin arg@@ um@@ arded , this is not true , but Paul should be managing to manage some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to pic@@ king the battle .
&quot; my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs desc@@ end in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties in law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants who bought milk bars and delic@@ acy business from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
she used the security to buy Coll@@ ing@@ wood Li@@ egen@@ dorf , in which Colin made the first je@@ ans charge of the family in Colin .
Colin says that he started West Germany when he was a small child in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he would never want the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke are not more part of De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claimed that Mark were paid when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
in both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , &quot; says Paul &quot; above the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made herself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of television .
Fair@@ fax Media took a contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is near Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family names through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not say that Paul and I would like to fight in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was still hop@@ ing for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct media sever@@ ity of president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can indeed do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - in hope to keep the boss in an even higher price .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with conduc@@ tive employees , he introduced a major problem to President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wants to repair : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions , if he would get good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys Diagn@@ osis makes sense , but others tried to count Tr@@ ump to monitor using its media .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship go back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was denied because of un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he had a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former campaign ranking Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Ci@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom among control , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaigns did something we do not know that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets without their inter@@ ventions do not contain more combust@@ ible material .
we will never learn more about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff had already made it a few times , it seems to be re@@ signed from him , then their effort has been worth the effort .
but no one has consistently make it resol@@ ve that tr@@ ump cone enc@@ es@@ es .
a part of the problem exists , that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , try to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump Material , which is possibly fo@@ ster their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO -@@ inspired by this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to bring the president out of strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press samples , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he could find out how to find out this .
this happened at the end of February when someone claims a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bun@@ ch of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter because he had no specific evidence , or that it is already expressed in the past , false alleg@@ ations and ref@@ res@@ h them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold @-@ makers added that then the then Chief of Staff Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he is more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still going to influence .
these distinctive factors make the cell@@ y mission very difficult .

from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
that are good news for the city .
with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with the then ambi@@ ance of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with the then ambi@@ ence of the hotel mbH on April 13 , 2014 , we lost approximately 30 000 overnight stays annually and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , the figures of refugees that came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the land@@ rat , as a collective accommodation provided for controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially the Freu@@ den@@ meister &apos;s Ober@@ bürger@@ meister Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and said then from seriously interested in the house .
he ought to keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again one house of the three @-@ star plus @-@ category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object 4 houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof already since a prolonged period of building blocks in front of the entrance , and if you enter the house becomes clear , vast renovation work will be done .
the floors were taken out , ceilings to the part down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large movable showers , the entrance to the entrance and the new window will be installed .
everything should be &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; just as Thomas Sch@@ erer ex@@ presses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are part of the equipment .
it is not to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but rather st@@ resses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms can be split up , discuss a closer look .
groups or business operators are to feel at home in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se did he already run , so sh@@ allow@@ er .
the performances of the city are covering with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the investment of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to set itself exactly .
just under a million euros , it is worth it .
outer plants also are based on the fore@@ man that is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created by the restaurant that is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Rap@@ id sets a Jury
in the Russia aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special company Robert Mu@@ eller is intended to have made a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
in the past few weeks , the Panel submitted work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to the job .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported that there is already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ds in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since extended , specifically designed for the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller were examined whether there were talking about Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are involved in campaigns of the Rep@@ ublic@@ s as an advisor of the Rep@@ ublic@@ s .
according to that , Mu@@ eller also took a more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote a couple of weeks ago that the Special Rap@@ id Tr@@ ump personally led to the centre and seek to search for whether the president may disabled people in the course of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide to check if the Indi@@ ct@@ ment should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be one of count chambers .
mostly , they are turned on if it is a larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
in addition , the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to download people under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were issued , which turned around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who participated in the meeting were called to a statement , it was called in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps were also Civil and J@@ ared J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his first campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the discussion .
right @-@ wing said on Thursday night in US television that the objective indication that Mu@@ eller does not leave itself in his work unless it should be necessary to deal quickly .
however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
however , the onset of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new foundation for president Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , President on Thursday evening signed a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; feel good because they can &apos;t talk about that they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he caught nothing of the entry of a Grand Jury .
but this I usually work in the en@@ ger@@ ms , he stressed .
the White House sum@@ med all measures that accelerated the work of the special error to &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey has said three times that I would not be determined against the president .
you have no reason to accept that something changed in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had been used but had been fired after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this ro@@ om@@ eration , the complaints against Tr@@ ump had become loud , so he decided to im@@ pe@@ de the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump I asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands under large pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of U.S. media , the White House of materials collected material against the special company and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about it if Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
other than an independent special talk about the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later @-@ known president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has found a position in which he could be fired at the presi@@ dency of the Ministry of Justice .
several of the transmitters of both parties want to prevent this step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic trans@@ formers issued on Thursday bills , after which the special inv@@ ali@@ es could not be released just as simple as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Arctic , a giant ice@@ berg has solved the almost seven times of Berlin@@ s from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
the Vin@@ ar@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Oc@@ ean@@ ic Research took place on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tonne heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big Kol@@ oss t@@ oss to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ic@@ kers that have registered researchers in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent , climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of ice hockey , is un@@ clear according to research data .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual co@@ c@@ eries in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor .
according to many researchers , this could be combined with global warming .
so far , Kol@@ oss was now part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is s@@ wimm@@ ers on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the front of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
at the north of the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ at was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and dis@@ rup@@ ted some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ spring is broken up there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it tells quite a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge have never withdrawn from as far as the front edge .
Moreover , the ice top stands voltage and could be broken down , if at a key hand , a piece of key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it gives after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the scra@@ p shows that the gl@@ acier appears directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project focuses on the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ at in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the junction of the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it is a natural head and is not aware of direct connection to climate change , the ice plate is now in a end@@ angered position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he confirmed .
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will continue to grow again or long @-@ term and possibly summar@@ ised , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this process will last decades .
even though this researcher did not bring to change this gigantic iron on climate change , but in the past decades a lot of ex@@ ams of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been broken .
this long wing of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the polar surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers in the 1950s .
the temperature increase contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been war@@ med around three degrees over the past 50 years , making it the areas of the fastest sti@@ ff@@ ness over the world .
CDU plan your pet s@@ ling with the personnel
because it is more difficult to occupy freely , for the CDU , to withdraw from the employer &apos;s employer , to be more attractive .
just before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has set 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have been behind their first working day .
the teaching positions are obviously very cov@@ eted .
in this year , approximately 620 applications were expected to be recorded during this year .
nonetheless , the circle further personnel to cope with the constantly increased requirements and tasks .
at this moment , there are 50 not occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
sought for amongst others doctors and engineers and forces of general administration .
the CDU obtain the initiative to hold the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG the initiative and to oppos@@ e it in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work as a concept for personnel and personnel development after the parties &quot; wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to cover only short @-@ term thre@@ ats on professionals , but future @-@ oriented applic@@ ability of applic@@ ability .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , require CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this has been listening to a good approach .
because the circle has the problem to do with personal problems you did not know earlier .
other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the address is given by a real &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
this represents a high number of employees , the disease or age due to the service .
so the time to hand , so that there are no more places to be occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , president of the CDU , continues to meet his party with his party .
he has recently looked at the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ ere surprise when he exhibited the personnel for a public in question and contra@@ di@@ cted the rest of the parties .
people would like to be verified that all the possibilities will allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; if we are not short in the short time to a satisfactory solution , the county management should be established with the trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the circular cities - a pet @-@ tariff , &quot; so peoples .
in order to pay the CDU , the employees and officials want to pay better than the tariff for public service is actually seen .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , enh@@ ancements or more money , if you are in a higher level changes to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established where employees are taking care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stit@@ ching Protection Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy deep@@ ens the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants li@@ fe@@ eds
in Italy , NGOs , who used the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , war@@ ned that they do not continue to continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minn@@ itis War@@ rant was a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers in a way who facilit@@ ated illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organisation , which only has been in operation since one year , refused to express a detailed demonstration of the Italian government of Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can not operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the organization said within an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all the charges that are currently collected , after we collected all information and evaluate the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , who were monitored since October .
it is thought that its crew is infl@@ atable infl@@ atable migrants which can be delivered directly by human tra@@ ders , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used to be used again .
at least another event was allegedly held , only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Acc@@ ession of the Prosec@@ ution , its content of Italian media has been published .
the crew is suspected to susp@@ end themselves over the authority of Italian Coast Guard , the rescue races in zone from humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct , boats must be over@@ thrown by an Italian police officer , which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGO , which are involved in search and rescue inserts , have so far be declared to be involved in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessary , but acceptable would not be considered &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; in their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is among them .
Minn@@ iti also told the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , in the last weeks , the efforts to strengthen the strengthening of Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local bourgeoisie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave those countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern salt region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and S@@ ights .
three friends offered were available .
the accommodation in Wach@@ en@@ eimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ o von Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
they followed rise points , partly on towers , of which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the vor@@ ced plains .
between there were always a leng@@ thy asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
again , the look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ches &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
many altitude metres were said to the last two days .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and contacts brought will@@ s .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers in the free@@ z@@ in@@ hal@@ atory P@@ ign@@ ant Sole .
Neustadt was also an@@ cho@@ red in Neustadt .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its very best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
are the sport stars in the future prior to computer consoles , rather than it crosses the wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long since become an increasing branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ages .
this also recognized the first g@@ ic@@ ca@@ ver@@ n that is increasingly involved in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded a E @-@ Sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire a completely new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train there are still some asc@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend the FIFA World Cup FIFA organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete in various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven will be qualified .
even Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in E @-@ Sports .
the explosion @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen currently has an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer field has to be dealt with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people still go into the stadium &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : they tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men , there could be more often more often to be present on these markets , than once a year to send the Federal Lig@@ atur@@ ity to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sports computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competitive level .
as in normal sport also , as in normal sport , Li@@ es established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian season , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a correct sport ?
for many , the presentation must be safe .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports@@ - School in Cologne , E @-@ Sports is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which you can find in classical sport , for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , it need cogn@@ itive performance , a technical and tac@@ tical compreh@@ ension and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be at the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ otic sees her problems : &quot; d@@ oping is getting more on a theme . &quot;
checks are difficult in online gaming , and in the scene was missing the structures of the classic Sports .
scientists have a positive impact on e @-@ sports as a positive impact on the e @-@ sports .
the players are international on the way , that &apos;s like a great global family , as there are no intercultural shirts .
a study by the business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth ahead of E @-@ Sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales in three years is expected to lie at 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the football @-@ Bundesliga , this is a little bit .
however , the E @-@ Sports &quot; isn &apos;t far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
International are already many countries .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participated in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is quite a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and France the football @-@ first @-@ league no@@ de@@ ga is required to set up an e @-@ sports department in the meantime .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany goes back , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall in nost@@ al@@ gia and to clari@@ fy the old times , this is no longer enough .
it is therefore , to preserve the tradition of the association but the company was set up on the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can not hold fast , that only in the case of football , it remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , Conrad Roy was sentenced to suicide .
one woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her convic@@ tion behind him and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced to the death of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfortable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter intended to stay free until his appeal .
it had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but its legal representatives went argu@@ ed that both they suffered as Mr Roy with an psych@@ ic illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter da was clothed with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned .
&quot; her actions have moved to Conrad Roy , &quot; said the lawyer in judgment .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it was a terrible she@@ er that they completely un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz did however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spiritual diseases have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said it &quot; no day , in which I don &apos;t make the loss of my dear Son .
I wish that he is proud of me and I am with all of my pain . I try , despite all my pain that we will be able to be with us for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that she would never be persecuted from knowledge , &quot; that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person , whom I have been together for my birth every day , is a pain which I will keep my life for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a right preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim any other , committed suicide .

companies satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ ine Minister : economy lo@@ osen s@@ iss@@ ings pace
it was often troubled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was the Minister of Economic Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is shown by more than one year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and enterprises from the region speak at T V @-@ Purch@@ ase by a change in economic policy - and ad@@ sor@@ ts at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Corpor@@ al companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing g@@ mat@@ ures the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has been blocked . &quot;
the greatest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the pri@@ or@@ tic list of the country .
even in this year the Ministry for the planning process is expected to stand up by 2021 .
the role in the plans of the country also plays the western direction of Trier , which is in the fore@@ most ur@@ gent issues of the Federal traffic plan .
the goal is to start operation in December 2020 , says Ministry of Foreign Relations Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us watches a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aiming to increase the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to improve the sales growth and the trend of the German exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish a dedicated company , the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incenti@@ ve for young apprentices , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 euro is provided for the armed championship and 2500 euro , when graduates are independent within ten years after the master@@ ing education .
however , the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , it is rapidly possible to create , at the same time , Jan Glock@@ auer , the Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
up to 56 new engineers who wants to adjust Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ owned mobility now , there are only 29 vac@@ an@@ cies .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
on the calculations of the Au@@ ction , CDU faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the Au@@ d@@ itors in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of regional streets .
besides Frank Nat@@ us also expected a concept of the country as it wants to fix the communication in the region .
furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the rating 3.4 .
they write over mol@@ ds Internet connections and di@@ ps .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter reaction
one day ahead of the announcement of Audi said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smar@@ ter options are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and went to European cities - including Munich , where BMW resident will be able to impos@@ e or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday to modify the three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the vent@@ ures as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the costs for the automobile manufacturers to install plants to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases by diesel vehicles , also to what it makes it difficult to keep the prize of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of having to ignore the mighty auto companies and to ignore the problem of the problem .
the company try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could adjust the use of so @-@ called fl@@ ashing devices to regul@@ ate the regulations when a car was tested but at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
in the past month , the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not being protected and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investig@@ ations@@ in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi accused of moving an system to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously load Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer is transfer@@ ring to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll and the laugh@@ ter against sorrow
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published Cart@@ oon Dra@@ fts@@ man , the name of the figures of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 records the Argentin@@ ian still and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; because there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he encouraged himself among others as a dra@@ fts@@ man for happiness cards - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the succ@@ essive day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the end of the 60s succeeded in breakthrough : with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ dil@@ lo took many fans .
and again the artist returned from cities .
large , all @-@ way Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures grew up in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
at the early morning , his own data still sits on the drawing , nearly ten hours a day .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favorites and watches are still a lot of spread worldwide .

Lav@@ en@@ del from the Provence from climate change destro@@ ys
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ en@@ del is rec@@ alled due to the conditions of famine and because of the diseases of the insec@@ ts , some scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , prepared large head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively end@@ angered because the plant was exposed to climate change impacts in the past few years , which has much less rain in spring and much more .
this has an impact on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ k@@ ills , and very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil sp@@ its not only for tourists , it is also important for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than long vegetable gro@@ wers with a great number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either weak@@ ened or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions that are considered to be considered are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing the evap@@ oration of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .

the assassination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce call themselves normally on Wedn@@ esdays in order to review their plans for the coverage of the youngest chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organizing the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ obj@@ ection drug .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what saf@@ er feels : they will take their children with the office which were the goal of an attack with gar@@ ages in 2009 , or let them go at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ ale , Al@@ lies .
you ask the repor@@ ter to propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary to perc@@ eive perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal strings .
there are drug ad@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being suspected of being for@@ ci@@ bly to the government of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als , which is dangerous for the chaos of Mexico .
there is no resting period of violence , and during all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto have registered office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and up to now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter you can find editor and their inspir@@ ator by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote about violence in his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack will receive deep , although his presence is present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , based on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts that make his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will be held less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ter will discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special appeal was erected in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal cases were initiated .
as with most thousands of murder , which are associated with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking and organiz@@ ational crimes each year , the mur@@ derer are only rarely used by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , it still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are und@@ ou@@ bt@@ ful and even though the terrain is still ab@@ dic@@ ated .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting with discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sil@@ ly to turn my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the Why , we do all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . it was forced out from his car and was probably translated to him for 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated into &quot; twelve times river . &quot;
the cap was gone in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to move freely into Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the theme of Val@@ dez , there &apos;s practically nothing worth as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extra@@ dition of the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since riv@@ eting fra@@ ctions were batt@@ ling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of emb@@ ell@@ ous , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ages for drug , which are bigger than many houses for the Living .
for@@ getting a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader one of the Rival fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have the children &apos;s stock , that Gang@@ way bought every copy of the edition as soon as it was extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper til@@ table .
the second fault that Val@@ dez was not forced to force , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , who had published the same story to leave the country on his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived to his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ b@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , without pun@@ c@@ turing the noise of the po@@ ison , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper has served a call for the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able reporting , and sales and advertising took place .
repor@@ ters loved it , hard working investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by an publication where they could read stories that nobody else was to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot &quot; award for coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for the Cour@@ age of the Mexican drug history , where she always led them .
he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on &quot; I said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
drug retailers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; said he in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ? why did you not tell what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun con@@ voy , who could curse like a port worker , a friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and suggestions , a teacher who knew how to survived .
they trusted on his routine .
he would bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite of the office , and sit at the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for the routine of his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question her own concerns about how they can do their work at the best and keep alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , its home starting and landing run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ awareness and self @-@ thought .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble ist , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative cont@@ act@@ ate , weak institutions and corrupt government officials will be home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where people met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce on security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days prior , Spyware that is sold solely to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two police officers seek protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who themselves are not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ter have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug con@@ feder@@ ates de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three major stories .
it was the assassination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they had also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office , led a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so it was careful to write when everyone in the city knows what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local by drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that ruled the reign of the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) who ruled all political levels in the whole century .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ level corruption .
in particular , Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man passed a military coup .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez have seen the column on the best informed information about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez lam@@ te a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is of it .
in the whole country , journalists became stronger , as they had written down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on obe@@ ys and buildings .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone in Washington , and tries to collect international support for the justice of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and destroy them because they said the truth .
it has since been asked since that she is again divided by the government because it is concerned that her rage has injured its obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez was repeated that journalists in Mexico of organiz@@ ational crimes committed against governmental officials and a equal company . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug con@@ feder@@ ates , but also on the orders of policies and security forces that were accompanied by the organized crime under a ceiling .
the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have an horri@@ ble effect .
no one keeps the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border area Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as before six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am here for my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were next to their separate head .
some branch have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others make it like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drug cart@@ els with an article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists from their native countries or even escaped from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assassin@@ ated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
to those who continue to stay and continue to work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet that the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is hell , therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat down in front of the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones began to sum@@ s up .
a number of sliding windows involving belt ri@@ vals and security forces near the bathing area Maz@@ da@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on @-@ border edges , they have published the news on the website by Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the phone .
the front page must be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens hot in the vicinity - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez gave a look at the polic@@ emen who held guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think of it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was assassin@@ ated on Javier , the practition@@ er asked me to send them on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to wrap up his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , if also a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
the researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker was so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even discover that his shoe skin was from red@@ dish Braun , and they said they had had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the wat@@ ers@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his incredibly well maintained condition has researchers to describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pic@@ kl@@ ed plant ress@@ er is the best preserved F@@ ossil in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , dug in March 21 , 2011 .
he met something , what seemed to be the sour@@ ced rock and decided to look more accurately .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tw@@ inkl@@ ing a little with the eyes , you might believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creation is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs issues - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably by meat f@@ ress@@ ful din@@ osau@@ rs .
the severely woven din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before spo@@ iling , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology , which is used as counter @-@ att@@ aching , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to re@@ ate his enemies , experts predi@@ ct that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier &apos;s family has made head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
in addition , researchers have now studied the wild beast and also called Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ ar@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady treasures , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its base .
although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady usually is surprising , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure was ch@@ ased by meat f@@ ress@@ ful din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution die the s@@ front@@ ation of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that are deploy@@ ing the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady - think about to@@ e , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are a lot of small and viol@@ inist than lo@@ ot that sign@@ alled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pir@@ ated behavior on a massive , severely damaged din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs rough@@ s have been to have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous times , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was rot@@ ted .
scientists continues to examine the animal regarding his life , including his con@@ ser@@ ci@@ ent content to find out what it did as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , was cast into a river and went beyond the sea , where it sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta were so warm like southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably widespread in a way than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with preserv@@ ed skin , but also kept in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original shape of the animal trap , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks like today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use your imagination in order to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous was a time when huge therm@@ op@@ oden , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , the earth went through .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus , lived millions years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was ch@@ ased the p@@ anz@@ ted din@@ osau@@ rs of some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ orn Cy@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists know their latest findings in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea , and in the mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fies .
the creature was discovered by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , in March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum it is the illustrated din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to th@@ igh .
the creatures had an average of approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) and weighed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,300 lbs ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , surrounded by his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the ge@@ aring plant stress was w@@ asted through the western Canada by a floo@@ ded river in the open sea .
but the underwater sho@@ ots of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin con@@ es still cover hol@@ pri@@ ge plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preserv@@ ing such as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the conf@@ is@@ sing .
the remains of the skin cover still the hol@@ dings of the skin , which bear the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : massage charger on A8 : many injured
fier@@ y accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass rally .
there are numerous injured , leng@@ thy st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , a mass strike of approximately 20 people are injured during the late afternoon of Thursday morning .
according to the first information of the police , there were almost 30 vehicles between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( county of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , in@@ tri@@ but@@ ted .
beyond the exact number of the publ@@ ishers no information received at first time .
it usually take slight to moderate injuries , said one pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a large holding of rescue vehicles was on the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometer long retreat in the direction of Munich .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , it also came on the back of a massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade have not@@ ched the identification number of the vehicles that now have a sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs a second accident happened in the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone experiences yet : nothing really sits on the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and just has an ingen@@ ious idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
when he enters , and wo@@ ke up an uns@@ ur@@ k , or bow down the ti@@ g@@ ast in the midst of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the backup ticket inspection .
you simply confirm that the ticket is taken , so it evalu@@ ates its space and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; if the offer is available , we expand it .
this is due to be available on many further correspondence routes in Germany in the beginning of the year and said , &quot; she said means of course .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the train the tickets ranking without Schaff@@ ner .
however , to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what do most passengers have already booked .
you must also have purchased the app of the rail , the DB Navigator , which is why the most convenient type of ticket is needed .
and last you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : it grows in the train , calls his ticket by &quot; My tickets . &quot;
the test is then a button for electronic recovery .
the train atten@@ dant to their mobile devices there is a message that Pass@@ enger X is located on the train and the booked seat is Y .
if the train atten@@ dant is in place Y , he knows that a passenger with already commerci@@ alized online ticket is required .
so , you can continue to keep on , keep on .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to use the passengers .
&quot; who would like to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying personnel , check out the DB Navigator just yourself .
this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter into individual customers needs . &quot;
those often goes by train , knows that in addition to late and missed trains , the tickets must be among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often , in any case one of the traveling documents do not have all the documents , which is needed for the validation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or identity document is missing .
the result are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and Fahr@@ meier , which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and del@@ ays when checking the own tickets and the career at the end takes the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test clients can use the new service .
and this is also available on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how one activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l has been sh@@ aken by her core .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented them and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she ur@@ ged over a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; the police has just killed 18 year old child , and still stands on the street , &quot; called it there .
conf@@ used , since no one had posted the information on her feedback , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly being offered on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the region of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l was thinking about itself .
but death was not new for them and their community .
you made your mobile phone to turn later on the evening to Twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field drive .
there were photos of police band and people , crying , and by a man who claimed to be a shield with the wording , &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ ren dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill all of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill all of you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded the testimony of their testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to ourselves and that we can choose from typically . &quot;
in this moment I felt Schüt@@ t .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would take the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
there is a history of survival and the protest , the love and of the loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of men who live in the community and the streets filled to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came with her daughter , which brought a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , drove the two a conversation after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; through the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remembered not how I have taught you when black people have to fight against what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remin@@ ded her of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 year old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l said later .
&quot; what happens today is a high point of what happened in the past .
they must know and see it and be drawn therein .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her a experience in which she personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ants of rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far off . &quot;
the first station , when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police department , which became the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business entity that made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on protest@@ ers .
slowly began to accept a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s appearance .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August . she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ING Association and focused on ess@@ ens justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l later met Fer@@ rel@@ l during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ er Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; would you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
as I declared recently in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , they didn &apos;t cent@@ ered , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ding had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dist@@ ra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer , along with six other nati@@ ves followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these men are represented , for so will I be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target was not to concentrate on he@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide , but in order to gather together a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious of participants in the film .
in fol@@ ge@@ fol@@ ds , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain po@@ or@@ ality during this work and in the realisation of the black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the role of the black sw@@ amp women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter exercise is repeated .
two of the three founder of the movement who have left the movie &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identi@@ fying the movie &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , schw@@ ule Women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have carried out the movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are batt@@ ling in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , schw@@ ule Women must bear the last load of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the right to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement of the black women and many black women are kept upright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l has been selected as heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who struck this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although she was on the front of the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings , as a black , sc@@ ule woman standing so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy by the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the telecommunic@@ ation cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the congregation and the police continues .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless they caught up for a singing and she feels so far , ever since they went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support it .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers will be discuss@@ ing over bit gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the person , although it is not yet built for long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area has been sp@@ ends since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in advoc@@ ate and opponents .
the topic hardly can hardly be found .
our theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; .
while the one @-@ bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This is really class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ugs ) or quite simple : &quot; size of course ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the prince insi@@ sted that a gallery attrac@@ ts more customers into the city , of which the other stores also profit , fear the opponents that then leaves the pedestrian zone .
in addition : the gallery is planned on the grounds , on which the pe@@ asant market hall is available , in which 13 direct operators are sold to market .
this will end with the start of the construction .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a Square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the estate are always very happy .
also the but@@ chers have been discovered for us .
we would like to wish that , during and especially after the building of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eted mark@@ er in a market hall in the gallery goes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should probably not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; why shopping cart@@ ons in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ us or supermarkets : I find that .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop transactions remain empty here - some for months and years .
since there is not yet a regular weekly market , it is more important to get us at least the market hall .
because all the product offered here is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is in an inexpensive price .
as you can see , shop transactions will be rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because its rentals are often not able for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pity , special transactions there are almost no more and what remains of it , will probably disappear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a brand hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the pe@@ asant market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , to drive all shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
my view would have been better to promote once a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market , there is no more space thanks to the mad@@ ness of many - as I find - sen@@ tim@@ eless construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
when the pe@@ asant market is made , it will disappear again a piece of culture . &quot;
a dedicated simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room at the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - which are attached to cables from the ceiling .
the 30 Por@@ traits have been created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from w@@ angen @-@ troops and hair@@ s that you were sent from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ tics took a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison after they had established diplomatic messages via the site of Wik@@ im@@ ak .
the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is called &quot; Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( One matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was in their expertise , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gression and pione@@ ering dis@@ sertation , whose convic@@ tion was converted to Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could look like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , if also something intellectual records could not only be interpreted as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , has been open to identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty in 2013 , including six convic@@ ts , including six violation of the sp@@ y law , computer , and theft .
by the prison the picture was supp@@ ressed , so it was only a single photo - a gra@@ vey@@ ard , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie where she sits clearly on a driver seat and is wearing a plat@@ el@@ bl@@ onde per@@ imeter - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the great success of their 2012 &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers in for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ ain and chew@@ ing g@@ um by sending the DNA from the waste to make a picture of them , like these people could look like .
that was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in prison , and they wanted to accompany him to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press review of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit this time , and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her or@@ pris@@ oned M@@ use were forced to un@@ tie bri@@ qu@@ or , which ex@@ iled several letters during the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; supplies images &quot; which would fore@@ see a future , in which the president of Chel@@ seas , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama became only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of lucky meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump causes a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government and against Trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to solve the rigid spo@@ ints , which he should actually fix to fl@@ aming .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after a strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in one of the gallery of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) at the end of the &quot; automatic disin@@ teg@@ ration , its foundation , race , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ ale DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific clo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological regards , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully entre@@ ated that our gen@@ ome does not take care of what we are , and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories , also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one side from the above mentioned Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she has appeared with a hands @-@ free party in the United States of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they have been cold for your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never forget your mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist that gre@@ ets out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ther , when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition yet not personally seen in the book - but when it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which collec@@ ts like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
this was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ ically were written down with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of lives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed along with Chelsea , like the movement that were also behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western , and a employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunt is a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford which had been sought to susp@@ ects a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday they issued warran@@ ts for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 passed away after several pins .
a warning message was published by the Chicago Police Department that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the location of the event for dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while police active according to the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em is professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that L@@ ath@@ em had now been l@@ ur@@ red and have been excluded from the campus of the North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ry .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ erville College spoke in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in France and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any manner . &quot;
the statement was added that War@@ r@@ ens colleague were sho@@ cked and want to put himself up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ects of susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects .
&quot; the police have an idea of their position , and our efforts to al@@ locate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities to help susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building stock of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that had something happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene than a cruel monster .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a wide variety of moti@@ fs , including possible h@@ unters . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA sched@@ ules in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice vers@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a given stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the criteria , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
in this regard , the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ re@@ ation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to give to concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of the WA@@ DA approved examination by Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren on the alleged state of publicly sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the examination because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has set an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit that what does not exist . &quot;
mut@@ k@@ os agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave me problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we repeated repeat that the un@@ disp@@ uted positions and regulations .
no one has added to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA from the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the organisation of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved to &quot; the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sold out no eggs more
they divided the corporate groups .
it is purely a precau@@ tionary measure which could be assumed for any health impair@@ ment , it was stated in the notification .
from now on , only eggs were delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative at fi@@ b@@ ular anti @-@ optic connectors .
Al@@ di would thus produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck to your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promise an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers do not mourn .
&quot; it was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
they sum@@ mon@@ ed people from outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies making up their staff .
due to the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measurement of the employee commitment , it allows companies to en@@ quire , speci@@ alize groups and dem@@ ographic groups , allowing users to handle an@@ onym@@ ity and dem@@ ographic groups , preventing the C @-@ Suite of exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the tracking of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nice , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools was used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ Surv@@ ey@@ s and Surv@@ ey@@ s of certain teams , there is a heat @-@ card of the company that shows the units most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives are low spe@@ edy results - so that you can drill it , why .
the company comes to see that at the top of the workplace culture have to remain , so that you have not published a blog post that has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als , where a former employee talks a blog post , which has been addressed a blog post , where those who have spoken , were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview a dedicated business option .
the Global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize it , saw a growing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
recently , has recently been registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , converting your company customized &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; to en@@ quire , confi@@ dential responses in real @-@ time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that can notify the pay@@ ed behaviour .
and if the chief executive guide is included , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has recorded the cur@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience valuable consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent is used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find an telephone number or email for the business center , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ hosp@@ itable and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no way to track the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent may include , problems that were previously sitting in offices in cities or states , have been hiding , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or un@@ ep@@ tive inter@@ ns , have been identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to commit eth@@ ics , values and employee talks in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out because of the En@@ ron Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they knew not that their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology for the monitoring of eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loading the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that assi@@ sts the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which supports both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised overall capital to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ sche took home $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment will barely be sur@@ pris@@ ingly , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s staff are expected to expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only available .
the staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company , feel their voices , and that the work they will do is worthwhile , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Best Experience is Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can reach us , when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are involved and engaged .
if the Analytics tools are talking to third , commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you can find support .
the data on the employee commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless if the stock of a company does not take action .
indeed , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that the change is in the way .
and if the change isn &apos;t fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can therefore det@@ ach@@ able and det@@ ach@@ able employees .
&quot; if you &apos;re asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Gu@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of yourself ?
and who doesn &apos;t take care of it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who has now conducted monthly surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures in the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , thus deliver@@ er .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organise several teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting into new in@@ sights regarding the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high revenue .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some of their tri@@ c@@ ines are pulled out and show the back full of silence from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the Se@@ man Football Center on the next morning at 6 : 30 am next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the guys the next three days , Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players and it has extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players already checked .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of Camps almost one week after the last season and during the summer school during the summer school he conducted practical exercises during the summer school .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal charges for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ score the N@@ CAA &apos;s rule , even if they add a further point of difficulty of the player .
&quot; we place this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply have pushed it , they pl@@ uck up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish their practices once the camp is finished , which is subjected to a clear view of its fields of a adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of highlighted class , which is already equipped with foot @-@ fo@@ ams , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no light task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from that weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far be brought to think that people will rent there a room and then set it on it to sign a practice .
if you have the video material from a exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best thing with what we have .
it is not too much to worry about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages intensi@@ fied
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages sent from third parties and their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a position on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to recogn@@ ise potential error messages and sending them to fac@@ ulty , which may show results of the facsimile file from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election .
the problem has also become a big political topic in Europe , where the French elec@@ tors were over@@ floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany also supports a plan to eliminate social media networks as soon as they could not succeed , h@@ ass@@ ingly be@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts can be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to knowledge that the stories of fact super@@ vis@@ ors are challenged , people want to read and share decisions about what they read and share &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to be able to feature the &quot; in association &quot; related Articles , and to other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .
create a com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a hat@@ red for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 80s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his hom@@ e@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ ae Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man , with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I found it so beautiful to see the manuscript from som@@ eb@@ ody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; surrounded the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other News &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only respon@@ ds to the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ party in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is your thum@@ b pressure !
and letters are still sm@@ elled by smoke ; for then fire was kindled a fire due to the light .
for som@@ eb@@ ody who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is defeated so with old pap@@ ules , that he lived from the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est , I have a little over rating &quot; ) seems to be really beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days in expl@@ oring the Vict@@ orian @-@ new &quot; Schloss expl@@ oring the archives and had to study the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ sto@@ cked Hy@@ a@@ ars on the walls and the bottles that had spent the centuries in the grave .
he walked through the land and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscapes , st@@ aging , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he drank &apos; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust got only 2006 the full access until the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
as Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ot@@ ok@@ s said &quot; Oh , &quot; it described in the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that country conflict would be bor@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fought the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , don &apos;t let it go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to get to the wider base of the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man that joins the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ asant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good beginning .
maybe they both joined together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the history of the Jesu@@ it patented seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented from the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral ( a discovery , which was made only years later when his Sar@@ g was dug up ) .
the images of the &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen had to be a thr@@ illing g@@ aun@@ er , always rep@@ ay debts and money for things they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men del@@ etes their school cris@@ es by giving rich women married - I present them as a bun@@ ch well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent in order to promote public . &quot;
Rho@@ des at the end of his use in the lock is Rho@@ des in search of other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ em@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready to do with the condemned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ ow@@ elle is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the opening of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ch@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team to Nelson Art@@ z to keep the logo and the slogan secretly .
at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign a festiv@@ ity on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the action has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel yesterday .
&quot; we do not think of course ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their yesterday released website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to make clear that it seems better than it seems .
basically , we are aware of that we know as a bath Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the promotion , there are more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able single argument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount to their new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) served as a pen@@ sions and transports in the army cor@@ ps .
so this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was held not more in the building &apos;s house , as previously , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
among the consultations , under the ch@@ aired by the government now , the five vice @-@ vice vers@@ ar@@ s and the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
therefore , the civilians in Y@@ as were in the majority .
the government draws the re@@ ins to the military .
Staff of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the army of Commissioner of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were ab@@ sent .
since the failed Cou@@ p , State of Staff has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers since the failed coup .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire drawing of the coup .
at 486 people who have been involved immediately on the coup attempt , has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the overthrow of God &apos;s gi@@ ve@@ away , since he give him the opportunity to &quot; complete the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in the handle ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ veil@@ s in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Staff of Staff , there are concern of concern because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ari@@ zation &quot; of the army , which manifested among other things in the repe@@ al of the head @-@ tu@@ bs for solo workers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the big cle@@ ver in the army and the security forces goes further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 national services per decree , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be , when I t@@ opped Erd@@ og@@ an the military .
gener@@ als open earlier than the native lor@@ ds of the country .
three th@@ umb@@ nails was lodged on their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the se@@ cular state of state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed the power of the military step by step , not least to appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an concluded a targeted killing of the armed forces .
in the voc@@ al magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a nam@@ eless officer , who , after the attempted p@@ utsch of fear of persecution , requested , the Turkish army will be a few years ago &quot; full extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if that too , NATO could not leave NATO for such development .
anyway , there are doub@@ ts in the Alliance according to the pur@@ ities of the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changed the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he considers to reduce the legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for long @-@ term work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two Cham@@ bers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and spending billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by how the US will alter the way as the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Act will stop the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidate to speak English who have the financial assets to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to re@@ construct race track
again , over the past few months , over the future of the race track you have been challenged - now it should go very quickly .
at the end of the year , the route is scheduled to be built on the tourist route .
in order to secure the future of Rac@@ ec@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to information from the public ministry , work on the circuit is scheduled to start at the end of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order the route of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ sti@@ g and conf@@ esses the country , especially for the tourism key &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route was estimated to be approximately 2.5 million Euros .
this sum covers the country 75 percent of that sum .
the contract , on which the shuttle also shall be ordered in the future of the country , shall currently be voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ based railway as operators are already familiar with the technical details .
&quot; this makes the ti@@ met@@ able to handle the vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and Railway Society will be closed for a period of 11 years .
the race @-@ Shuttle was to be ordered in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , during the course of a pilot company , the distance of sufficient many people was used to reg@@ ain them again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex Ro@@ bots is real , and we should worry about that
just as you thought it can &apos;t be missed in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start their ascent .
customers can choose the ocular color of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are fun with them , but the company deliver any amount of it , and we will see them more often more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said when the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone fo@@ res@@ kin who feel warm , with aware of human reactions which can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adjust his robot even according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and do everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot on the form of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will still be wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; that would look like a Step@@ per woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone cone .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to custom@@ ize its robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling as ti@@ mid@@ ity .
and then there is still the true Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ programmed personal@@ ities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives an impression of rel@@ ent@@ ment and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you like what you like , and it doesn &apos;t like what you like to like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also gave their voices , all like true people !
she may be tired of being fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in the mood . &quot;
there are many be@@ wil@@ ful aspects in this promotion of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the under@@ lying female characteristics of rape , if one gets a step forward to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : ir@@ resist@@ ible ) Far@@ rah , troubled them most .
on his site true , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this sex robot is not only a fat or just a different Sex@@ y lighter .
her birth and her increasing refin@@ ement show a little dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal in equality of sex@@ es to a wish of sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional enc@@ ore .
most men do not have sex robots , and while FR@@ R indicated its rising popularity , they still remain provis@@ ionally on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what age out of the border zones can be le@@ ak@@ ened with regard to the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or je@@ al@@ ous until they are the free market for permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robots are at a time to appear in which the rights of women world@@ ly are threatened to have a president in which the White House has ordered to have women sexually attacked .
the awesome aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos;s &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affects the un@@ matched body and the em@@ itted eyes , but as realistic these vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it feels like a great leap .
the target behind this sex robots exists , a physical activity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
your builders refused that they feel themselves in human beings that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; the robots make no real women .
they cannot be held from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or a background history , nothing to in@@ depen@@ dency or any of what the fantasy tot@@ al@@ al sub@@ jug@@ ation could be anno@@ yed .
differently expressed : they are counter@@ parts slaves .
or to express it in the spe@@ ech@@ es of 2017 :
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to understand the sound mind
it is become a B@@ ins@@ en@@ we@@ ster@@ ing of the tr@@ ump era that the political circumstances which have split the US voters , also families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ o there were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror by Tr@@ ump .
we make sure to allow us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ ices the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famil@@ ies have been noted .
I mention this , because my c@@ ousin , who lives in Chicago , has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who has long visited this week in New York for a long time .
it rec@@ alled me that the unit can have an enemy effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same page .
to make the dining table , the certainly is a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also has significant risks associated with him .
the lin@@ ke was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his Presidency did power to push all the power to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ b will no longer be found out of one day .
however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly in consideration of their standards .
I found myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ance &apos;s com@@ od@@ d version of the decline - the dog on the author , which looked at 14 % of income tax ( but at least did we know like his tax return ) - which both occur in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy in order to qualify as un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ dan &apos;s Park Hotel , and the best three dollars which you can spend in the city if you need not caffeine .
the horses have enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ushed and the animals are turning round about her own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and challenging music convey@@ s this in noticeable way .
so many clubs are disappointed : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are committed to offer much exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city shall not be justified .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout located in the north London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and all a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was comp@@ elled to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions in a scale of up to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in coffee at the corner of my road it is the same as plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but also practic@@ ing pressure on the server to enter personality in a situation , which is not necessary .
the poor woman at the department store was exc@@ used , while I tired the experience of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to the hospital in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison term for a hospital visit for the second time .
in the past year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of s@@ itten to his hands that he suffered to the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder in the prosec@@ uting of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s early morning by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly ru@@ ff@@ ling , who hid themselves in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , she was too sigh@@ ted .
the National Prosec@@ ution authority said that it will be held at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and its burden can be heard this year .
pist@@ ori@@ us is running danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger Schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen was released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of our students will go to the high school in the future , four at the secondary school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Be@@ es@@ ental patri@@ cians in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the school release , the 29 pupils of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle that grows in the chick@@ ens , but then released into freedom .
in this way the m@@ lower sh@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the h@@ ens . &quot;
farmer Arnold invented a strange egg , and let it br@@ üten it from his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken breast , a little e@@ ag@@ les came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him , the e@@ ag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain and emp@@ tied their wings .
after this , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chick@@ ens .
the h@@ ens are dancing with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Adler stand for the integration , spokes@@ person Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
indeed , the young is different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it .
he will never be as a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish everyone four @-@ t@@ ug@@ gets that he feels in his new school .
it followed than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who jumps forever again in teaching positions , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the ch@@ ick time is over now , declared Class @-@ teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very ung@@ od@@ ly , because it was really great time .
finally , they can rely on the square .
finally , all students have left a song of summer time and holiday season .
with the children great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ drivers have already registered for the new school year .
arrested two Bulg@@ arians on Il@@ legal Camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated because of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal men was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
she was released on the same day as a study started .
the Foreign Ministry reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians was later released .
the Greek authorities have lost control of the free camping and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant banknotes .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court may impos@@ e a sentence .
software update for diesel cars : what data do you need to know
how accurate is the software update ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group has offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to increase the emission behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europa are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory update will only apply to the vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has been arranged to the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but still no exact date .
Daimler has informed that subject to any data subject .
if you don &apos;t require inspection , it will be done within the framework .
how long will the change to pass in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin means .
the slope from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political printing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , our car manufacturers do not act at the topic of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long does the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming , it could be an appointment .
what do drivers do that make no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE wa@@ its for waiting .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE does not fear .
but just in the regions where branches are threatened .
in rural area no value loss for older diesel has to date .
the ACE runs with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in Washington .
the first prize for President Tr@@ ump promises to become polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per to be won by the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural direction announced on Thursday we were also singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will organise a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the awarding of his wife Mel@@ ania .
the L@@ ear winners with progressive TV series announced award winners so far to do their participation in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lec@@ ting the arts and human rights - even the funds - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that I will use the conversation with the ump in order to clear their visibility .
after the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural direction in the US capital .
among the former pre@@ dat@@ ors Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life value
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will come to R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are ra@@ r .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes it great fun as he was medi@@ ated in the press conference .
it reports varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red that no application would be fulfilled for demanding profile .
the City breaks for the next possible time an architect or building engineer .
thus - under the regard of the regular period of notice - even enough time for one el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ voting rights , the applic@@ ants must have a conclusion of the applic@@ ants .
for this function will keep the city in any case .
would you not have to fill them any more , the citizens would have to leave the advice until Offen@@ burg .
but violence is the city and it itself important , says W@@ acker who reported from a good company lim@@ a as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years , some significant projects have accumulated since the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees safe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects in the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low level parking lot approximately are an@@ exposed .
the Kin@@ ley bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium restoration is still subject to a theme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are doing really &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker is estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
Gest@@ age to be present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of large playing area .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted upon multi@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the design of the green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town as ensemble is listed as monument protection , it is important to have it &quot; an eye to it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ izes the first urban center master .
oh@@ in carries the Stadt@@ bau@@ master high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) has been in existence for 15 years .
also that his successor will remain long , W@@ acker : &quot; we want to try someone who really could be identified with the site . &quot;
the continu@@ ity of continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to the information of the town of Has@@ lach , he should have completed his studies as a diploma in Civil Engineering or Bachelor with special field of architecture and have good skills in the fields of construction and building planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stands high and deep construction , construction planning , mir@@ ro@@ wer@@ age , administration of urban Li@@ egen@@ et@@ schaften , municipal office with yard and urban construction , including monument protection authority , including monument protection .
bicycle is thrown on lines : southern rail closed
according to police , previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged , that the her@@ etic freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male singers and search for the night hours after them .
near the crime was a thr@@ ott@@ le robot and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying so@@ vi@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Poznań to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves into great risk and end@@ angered the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the installation and the delay @-@ time and the costs for rail traffic could also be assigned to the perpet@@ rators to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern railroad line could be guided without disabilities .
there were almost ten personal cars were log@@ ged in Friday morning , two of which concerned about correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced by some 200 meters of surface .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can be used to your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory per@@ formers .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the United Kingdom caused mag@@ ist@@ rates and bl@@ asting , recur@@ ring or bloody inci@@ dents , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those affected , the meat and dairy products will be to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins contribute to develop a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that Immun@@ ology in the intest@@ ines of pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide themselves in the body , not in the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflamm@@ ations , are balanced by cells , protect the tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium tend towards inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a type of tolerance sub@@ mitting immune cell in mice intended to bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ias and Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an had the mice in their nour@@ ishment , the more they had taken from these immun@@ ity cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an diet is toler@@ ate , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal injury , if the same system is effective in humans .
the Post@@ doc capacity Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan visited a kind immun@@ ity that promotes the tolerance and found that a group of study mice had such cells , but was not housed in a different group of the same tribe , but had not been separated .
they thought that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of mice were revealed to DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found in six sub@@ types , which were present in mice with the immun@@ o@@ ons , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were moved in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they failed to develop a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oma and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system , the researchers tested L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and caused little amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .

when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be known as an additional product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the lining of mice , the number of these cells decreased by approximately 50 per cent , but when tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values decreased , the number of cells decreased by half .

Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho loved his debut with S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds signed by Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final early season game before the UEFA Cup campaign against Real Madrid begins Tuesday , and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was not excluded from the preparation of the blues tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to make Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he th@@ inks - he doesn &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him earlier than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent announced in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho loved three other new comm@@ it@@ ings , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already performed a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four pre@@ paid new duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get four of four , I thank the club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given much trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner to the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
to the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising already earlier .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new deep stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
like the wind twi@@ sted , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was going to look at the head of the Prime Minister , Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with a certain concern for Berlin .
only don &apos;t stur@@ geon from the party head@@ quarter , merely no other wind from the league , so the most important desire of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , the fundam@@ ent@@ ally changed .
since then , the employee sees the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with an aston@@ ishment of the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with the counter@@ parts in the approach .
there were dr@@ ill@@ ings .
and , one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal German CDU saw a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is once more : red @-@ green is simply not able to reg@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial staff of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green Party regime led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his Red @-@ Green Coalition lost their votes against the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the green Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the tr@@ unk@@ y @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to ad@@ mit their mandate .
the Over@@ come to the CDU means a clear del@@ etion of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets has to return to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and elec@@ toral campaign of the Gre@@ ens publishing network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gro@@ an in the SPD election , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ lim@@ ber party reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without own government increase after the tak@@ eover of the green El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small cris@@ es in the SPD Federation .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mist@@ akes started with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more , not cal@@ ming down the com@@ ra@@ des .
everything will be different from the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
it was then also - and it became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the de@@ af , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ a beat the party .
the com@@ ra@@ des spread again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came in .
and with him the next stop came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the phil@@ harmon@@ ic harmon@@ ie during his city .
and because in the crisis of crisis , it was so pretty much wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony minister has already been in criticism for many years .
Mi@@ ese remov@@ es were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past few weeks , Because of the last weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in acc@@ ents .
the best @-@ story of the former Mayor of Hannover , to build his power in Berlin , was not hidden under Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they let him grant him , because they spoke a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
because there is no gu@@ ilt on the Party &apos;s internal compul@@ sion , because there is no fault .
and Schulz will not be at all .
sometimes the com@@ ra@@ des must ende@@ av@@ our to keep their own rows .
their anger is aimed at the green , and here above all on the tr@@ unk@@ y par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and the ra@@ iny , such as Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets their own career having interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the part@@ n@@ ines in the SPD federal government , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as direct can@@ did@@ acy because of their person as direct can@@ did@@ acy , but also elected to the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Party .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliament , compl@@ ains a &quot; democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil passed through the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who has been a candidate for the federal election in the Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CDU report de@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more str@@ ingent of the CDU of Lower Saxony has given .
sustain@@ ing of the centre III
who wants to be gentle home in the years , will soon get assistance from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler once again released a review of the previous year .
since 1991 , there has been in sensation of san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken two third of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations have a &quot; success project &quot; - it &apos;s finally important to promote internal development , and not only complete new building areas .
on April 4 , the Government of the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ financing area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which amounts to 500 000 Euro of the country , the rest of the village sens@@ es .
how does a sanit@@ ery arises now ?
you will continue to further study Sch@@ in@@ dler where &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it was also a role of whether in the planned field at all interest of concern .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial limits may also shift once again .
on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
the cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the renov@@ ations would be carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ loc@@ alization of inner cities , improving the residential and occupational health and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out , that is , per land , carried out .
the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute .
the approval period for funding has been running since 1st January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only the inventory should be carried out , in the framework of the parties involved in the rehabilitation area .
as possible , as possible , during November or December , as possible , as possible , as possible , as possible , during the next year , as possible .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that each commune had to carry out pre@@ vent@@ ative precau@@ tions .
it is therefore , to evaluate the city levels of urban@@ isation and decide when rest@@ art and in which per@@ imeter .
it will be registered in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann himself will come again to sensitivity and make a picture of the location , promised them .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties .
therefore , there will be questions that will be sent to citizens over the next few weeks , and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot piece &quot; , in which it concerns among other things in order to build the building condition and re@@ viewing views .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , data can be made in size , distribution and residents of a residential space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be filled only when operating rooms are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , &quot; Got@@ zel , &quot; pointed out that a pre@@ filled questionnaire should not be submitted for funding at the same time .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible to be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ screen principle &quot; functional &quot; - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
it could be possible to reserve for later &quot; reservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclu@@ de , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project have been shown to make a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sav@@ our@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor itself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country where it is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his pet door , its office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and poin@@ ter and now offers service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative An@@ a@@ esth@@ es@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant process is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology is similar to one cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the castles at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now fitted both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the tax .
the costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a Navy helicopter to fly South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers , according to the data of the military , which were transferred to the TI@@ ME Magazine until 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president on board was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter in Connecticut was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House asked the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the Deputy Marin@@ ator man@@ de@@ ur .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17th July at 7 o &apos; clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House would be delayed , due to the limitation of operating hours a second team would be needed for return flight .
the original air@@ scale prev@@ ailing during the event , while the security personnel in the unit remained at the plane during the time .
from the record of TI@@ ME , records were not clear if ultimately , a second flight number was necessary .
the Hatch Circuit Act for@@ bi@@ ds Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; he wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; said the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was characterized by the White House as an official event , and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events also have political tops .
at the event , President had a violation of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate in 2004 , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts for action of government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but your use only for a photo OP to request is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump has conducted an investigation in February when the presidential airplane before the background of his first fighter s@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages which protect against the use of the presidential candidate by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products made of all 50 states that are produced by American workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deputy spokes@@ man of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations lead frequently training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise fragments .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 practice sessions in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted in the event &apos;s training requirement for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units also flew an additional 11 hours a day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Presi@@ dential Suppor@@ ting missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for no other acqu@@ is@@ itions that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in building the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have a budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the US Ministry of Defence , the Do@@ D budget for 2017 is the Do@@ D fee for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the funds is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates contain staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not contain the personnel costs but the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , S@@ ean Spy , def@@ ended the use of helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that will be made in America , &quot; said sp@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , as the most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been un@@ ti@@ relessly .
of course , it is reas@@ on@@ ably reasonable . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump with the helicopter inter@@ act when he entered his tour through South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and O@@ scher@@ ed with the media over his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
peak re@@ mark of the second tennis league in the table third of the competition SV .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will arrive tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel near the table third of the Tab@@ l@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still imp@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has received the sense of reality .
team manager Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has any respect to the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays always in a similar formation .
just at the rear position I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the view@@ dor@@ fer SV ensure the import from the high North .
&quot; whose Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( every Denmark ) .
&quot; that will always be heavy for us .
there you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the new@@ com@@ er team is practical for the trip to the high North .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
now it manages to win the Ch@@ allenger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament , which is part of the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec game Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) to his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ stran@@ nik @-@ Cast@@ illo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski even at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ b@@ üh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel but also like Botan@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ Schools , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster there could also be Má@@ té Val@@ cus@@ z back into the team .
it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was not number one of the junior pupp@@ ets list in January 2016 , if anyone gets up from the train@@ ee by Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay .
how America should harm OMV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump does not work when he sat on Wednesday evening , under the law on the deep@@ ening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his reply to adopt the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress gave a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction of Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ ams against the US pres@@ crip@@ tions .
after all , the draft was to re@@ prove European companies that help the Russians helping to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
accordingly , since then Invest@@ ors of the native OMV has been co @-@ financed together with other European firms , the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ line Nord stream 2 .
the dru@@ g@@ cul@@ isse is enormous .
nonetheless , it is too early for a estim@@ ation of the consequences as to the official statement of oil concepts .
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions still per Executive Order to life .
twelve guns are at your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to which the Group could slow and could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role back : the city represents 46 cooking rings
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back to urban children &apos;s buildings .
on September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the essence of Ess@@ enti@@ care to the municipal kinder@@ garten ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Faculty of Youth , the good news : &quot; we are all pleased with us . &quot;
cooked is still apart from the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooked refriger@@ ated .
the city runs in the region of 46 kinder@@ garten restaurants , in 44 the children got a hot meal .
in the last kit@@ ten year 2800 children at the tables were seated at the tables and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only children who are looking for 45 hours of lessons are explained in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children up to 14 am . &quot;
46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers have taken up the delivered food from the 1st of September : they heat the delivered food , supplement them for let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , rinse the food , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees will be assigned to a her@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups , as well as seven other facilities - decides above the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; kitchen tables are now fixed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is simple to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because we are doing this : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children are to help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ strength of the team is meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a familiar strength in the K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts in them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the acidity of the K@@ ita @-@ premises - so far the duty of the kitchen forces - so far from special cleaning agents are done in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen performance also the charm , which they set out in the cost comparison between own reg@@ imes and foreigners for the city as the most economic situation , it is from the Press Office .
and that , even though 46 sub @-@ forces were newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational field not so strong in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections may only be representative , if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , acting head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women have to be di@@ spar@@ ed in the provinces of the provinces . three women voted for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women can &apos;t be exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be very representative and cre@@ dible , if women participate un@@ restricted and are included in all parts of the election process .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen site reli@@ eves the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report to the ab@@ duction of the ab@@ brevi@@ ated Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael E@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ atzen continues to take discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ ald Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve to see the appearance of the Catholic Church when Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would blow its deeper regre@@ t about its own underground or false evaluation of the processes .
the Vatican , &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that coverage of violence with &quot; two lei &quot; measure can be measured in reporting on violence .
regarding the inter@@ ventions in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be prevented by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and corrupt actions , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is known to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion about to keep it for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the interview with Bay@@ urn und Taxis in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on the church , and this is a combined F@@ ressen oder . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical agent in their youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be with joy@@ ful children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not fair , present the standards for earlier decades , since the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael E@@ emann , who was written by R@@ atz@@ inger the &apos; My Bro@@ ther of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the Bish@@ op@@ ric education of Regensburg with the re@@ conn@@ aissance lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually viol@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ u@@ bility of victims , 67 domain spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing that Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister was employed in many cases physical and psych@@ ic violence .
the punishment for the students could even fall severe in high levels .
in contrast to numerous other words , many victims were estimated that many victims were estimated by R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even more positive memories were united with him . &quot;
in an interview , E@@ emann , why the final report on the Miss@@ a sk@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ rows Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence to the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
a result of bringing many students of his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
on the other hand , it is also available as cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has been handy when a cathedral rate is musi@@ cally no top performance .
how can you evaluate this final report as its Bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you turn the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger needs to be found at all .
he is only devoted to eight pages and is clear by any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or mit@@ er in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the non@@ violence in the pre@@ school occurred outside of his action sphere .
you can make any case earlier , of which too late or first interpre@@ tations have not been taken seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given by almost all respon@@ dents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his pup@@ il Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes him a very excellent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very popular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compreh@@ en@@ vious &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly with cake , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ bons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always circul@@ ated from grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is consistent with its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ motiv@@ onal@@ ity that led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages too .
that he did not only wear them with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also for the gathering together and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys to hair or ears , he deeply regre@@ t , deeply sad@@ ly .
it is said to be hon@@ our@@ able , however , that such gu@@ ardian methods were in frag@@ ile time , 1960s and 1970s , with parents , as with teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us , who was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced that in a worldwide school , a state gram@@ mar school .
compared to what is actually seen in this report , namely , the ent@@ ail sexual abuse and the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the fre@@ il@@ ding Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
then one asks , whether it was not more acquain@@ ted with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media fell just upon him .
the Bavarian Pope did not work many who have never understood it , still being e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report un@@ loaded Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report very much about the topic of abuse during Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also apply any winding or mit@@ ri@@ ment regarding sexual abuse of load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults committed to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never have given me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a interested standing representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims were silent .
if they confi@@ ded not to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ orus , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of failure ?
Michael E@@ emann : a question@@ able pup@@ il it formulated like : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he would have had his in@@ sights ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had been delayed .
I hold it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , assume that ... Bu@@ ben ein@@ ru@@ penetration or more recently opened , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ wers , confi@@ denti@@ sts , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus , the report comes to a clear result : &quot; that in the advance of the affected students and / or their environment , the investigation could not be confirmed . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is so free from anyone seeking abuse .
it can &apos;t be accused of having to prevent him from or to display him .
hence , there is no reason to bring his good name with this rebel@@ li@@ ous crime in connection , as it happened in some cases .
in the media , much of &quot; violent &quot; could be read from the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station .
the report of the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is being thrown in the report .
must he live with this approach ?
Michael E@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and men@@ ac@@ ed to a giant mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violent sei@@ z@@ ure , in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is being clean : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ orus of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant .
all the horri@@ ble test education , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were regularly scre@@ ened and mal@@ ign@@ ited , all of them occurred at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where truly sk@@ ill@@ ous states have to have reigned .
but with whom Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to her face when she had already been a high school teacher .
on the way , like most of the witnesses , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
it was just happy to come from her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ eg@@ ic &quot; states .
what else was on the domain or high school ?
Michael E@@ emann : there was even discipline , but no sa@@ ab@@ ian violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with which the report comes to conclu@@ de that &quot; many victims were the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even positive memories of him . &quot;
so , at the most , the prec@@ urs@@ or to have been carried away .
however , despite all efforts , the report was given only two time periods where it was reported by the states at the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and from their predecess@@ ors at a school , at which he did not have been and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently wear the ears in front of the states ?
Michael E@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ eb@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
in this respect , he pointed out that , &quot; that in the pre@@ school , the test was still pract@@ ised . &quot;
already in view of the peri@@ or@@ ative pres@@ election process he predic@@ ts int@@ ru@@ sion .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test pen@@ alties in Bavaria had been banned .
before that time it occurred in a legal grey zone , as every one of us still knows .
it was difficult to estimate it too much , where the affected could possibly be over@@ done or dramatic , and where truly the allow@@ able limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have been torn apart .
it is not true .
the exam for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it is not fair to turn back today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael E@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger , past to present moral standards .
the prin@@ cess has been right there .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ ag@@ ated at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of off@@ ence and violence at innocent children &apos;s school , which goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally ready .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds to discipline and punishment , so ear@@ ths and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical punishment then he was forbidden , too , it has also been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger period has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject of exam@@ ining also for language ?
Michael E@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict@@ ates X@@ VI , tells of his perspective , and the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a part role .
nevertheless , I am not able to sof@@ ten that he led a thor@@ ough reg@@ iment .
but this must be said to be once said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of world tran@@ si@@ ders , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ y alone one makes no great singers and before every success , in which area , always discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ or@@ ating .
as what a man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
Michael E@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really quite well and always experienced his wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep believ@@ ing and warm good people , of whom you could not imagine that he could do anything that only a fly something .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and him as a member of their family .
those who have not given him up to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the dom@@ es are grat@@ eful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ sper@@ son , to which they still look up today and honour them .
and , yet , once again clearly : all that should be prescribed for him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ence and another prominent brother has to make a medi@@ al fall @-@ bo@@ ck .
there is the evil purpose that stands behind it , just too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the state of interest would have had a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
