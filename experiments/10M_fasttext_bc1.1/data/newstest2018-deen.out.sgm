<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlantique, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian state government, are all other than currently - but therefore very revealing.</seg>

<seg id="51">The National association for the fostering of colored has issued a warning for colored people, due to the discriminating politics and racial attacks by the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Guide to the State of Missouri, which should come into force by 28 August 2017, demands special attention through the state, since a number of unquestionable, road-based occurrences will occur in the last time throughout the country and here is" "" "says in the position of the group."

<seg id="53">A recent recated law of Missouri, which makes people severe, discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that oppose the disproportionate of minorities, the group admits to the classification, said NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have the rights of civil rights who pass people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be put together because of their skin colour they will be put together or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited as racial clubs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died infragile circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline on the journey, having been arrested by the police in Missouri, without having to be accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the office of the General Attorney General of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers will be more likely to be more common in the state 75 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU general assembly Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the recess of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-local federation met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest farmed, 40 dairy cows and also many young ones looked after and in five apartments holiday houses.</seg>
<seg id="72">The Black Forest's milk is for him the alternative-less verge path for the milk of its cows, so tilting.</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regional trains come to the table of the Ferinarrowest.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the SHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence as "Elementar."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate net income on this steep area.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green economy has to be processed for much work, much has to be processed with the sense of the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been busy here with the conditions and with the topography," the pivot.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead a biocide.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the municipality has recognised the significance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">At cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the view of the areas could still be pulled out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, the people who are working in agriculture and are thought on how they continue their operation," "" "emphasized the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area is thus 40 hectares that must not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders were funded, a quarter brought the village of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, the farmers were 12 610 euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a really good job, without farmer and land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">There are also best food for Peter White: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The regional directing line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state grant of women.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to uphold the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the bodies listed by LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the unfenced area cannot be boiled (hangar for over 35 per cent) and must be at risk of view.</seg>
<seg id="95">There is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would be located just under 16 km of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump occupies the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate the same as every other - therefore the fall of Saddam Hussein's place on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he symbolizes a symbolic occupation with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the Presidents of the legating Immigration by the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A Horde of Boboaters and Liberty immigrants would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the significance that it was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta shield: "I don't want to enter a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively properly, but as he formulated it, it does not really get a story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the raising words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labor, your poor, and your poor masses, that seek after them to breathe freely, to breathe the elbows of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to see the "elusive trash" on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not work in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of its importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they complete a very political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show connections between French and American Republican Republics by performing in an unused classical depiction depicts female bodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure no longer abstract - it has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself bears a very different name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American extra vism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to change from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big Schreihthan Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was argued but rather an early neo-conservative, which brings the American flame into the converted world: "Lady Liberty is going.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the fetch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not shine the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something large.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and quite a question of a standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus, to see how they've seen by the exhausted, elongation, but hopeful people after long and often lost travelling on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from perspective of men that seek refuge and improve their chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome you must listen.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, that Miller and Trump ever want to detect.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine the way, but the hatred, who is the only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever is the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was promoted to become Captain of the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals address was incredible "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a row of athletes at no matter whether they were Scottish or train or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh has arrived quite natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of silver medallists that will compete for the fifth world championships in the 400-m Hurdles, says it "unbelievable" is that 16 scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">The total number of athletes at the World Championship was reached seven years in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Muir Middle distances leads on this path to five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The foreign capitals says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only a team, but in some cases, also in the medals and at the finalists.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about team chapter to be in it is that it was chosen by other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team-mates have tuned for me and chose me to something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>

<seg id="155">What are my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is really important to put on this home language and take advantage of that we are at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will be simply as a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Critics of criticism on Facebook: do not exceed a public ministry when you cannot bear the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for anything, from the inner policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He sweat the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "in the year 1783 Washington said:" "" "the speech can be taken away, stupid, and dumb, we are led as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employees have blocks the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American National Liberals Union commended him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Staff of the governors proposed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online commentary was full of an equivalent reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "only Facebook" "", "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second supreme approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand with the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and debutt his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons that come to the side of the governor - which is a public Forum which is officially designated and by employees who will be paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of controllable or hacking or hassfuls people using the pushers online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the actual people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no troll.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments were respectful, thinking and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hassly met, but she asked them to hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commits polite that I had disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," wrote in the commentary volume of the news "The Post."</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the governors of the governors as" "" concentrated spam attack "" "," the other will "" "" be called "" "" of intercession "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to assign a message by simply blocks a critic and deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time, if you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers with critical cheating agents and to burn or burn disclosures and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants that criticises that he has impacted Facebook and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="432">2018 - all models have been taken together - 500,000 to be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations for one day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who now order a "Model 3" must be delivered with delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla creates its nagelnew, never ever tested in the practice of tested production lines with maximum utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document based on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there is also a splendid courtyard, too which belonged to the church or the patronor law and not vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Any consequences are coming to Paris Saint-Germain for UEFA EURO, because the conductive organisation, which monitors the European game, has power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play-rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA EURO, means that PSG will point out sometime, that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>

<seg id="1127">PSG can also make money loose with security in order to make Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the teams by the energy-rich Herrshal family of Qatar.</seg>

<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP dropped from the concentration on the monitoring of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used originally in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and to build a global mark - to a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year shift period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferine continues to break from overtime issues.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out-clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the invoice of the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the total amount of EUR 44.4 million will be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>

<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to persuade their financial advisors by combining their revenues by companies dealing with the owners of a clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should not exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not apply as a legitonal income.</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation would have dampened the speculations about an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warns that economic growth will remain, when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's policy decision makers (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In their quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that inflation would continue to rise to almost 3% in the autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1269">It is expected to provide time for the financial plan to allocate from the coming February cheaper financing to banks, although it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central prognosis of MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) will be weak in short time, as pressure on the reunion of households will continue to use the consumption."</seg>

<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until these prices and the economy will be fully reached.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the last conviction of the Bank, the call increased after an interest rate, since inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers in July increased to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation fell to 2.6% last month in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected to return to the next few months.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can indeed do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports from the news media - in hope to keep the boss in an even higher price.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, at his first working day with conductive employees, he introduced a major problem to President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: bad information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions, if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways Diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to count Trump to monitor using its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship go back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was denied because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he had a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former campaign ranking Sam Nunberg in February opposite POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Ciicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter custom among control, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns did something we do not know that Trumps tweets without their interventions do not contain more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will never learn more about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had already made it a few times, it seems to be resigned from him, then their effort has been worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently make it resolve that trump cone enceses.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists, that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump Material, which is possibly foster their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "POLITICO -inspired by this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to bring the president out of strategic reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>

<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when someone claims a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Staff of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter because he had no specific evidence, or that it is already expressed in the past, false allegations and refresh them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold-makers added that then the then Chief of Staff Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he is more effective as Priebus as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still going to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair by US President Donald Trump, special company Robert Mueller is intended to have made a so-called Grand Jury for a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks, the Panel submitted work, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under appeal to the job.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The transmitter CNN reported that there is already first invitations of the Gremids in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin since extended, specifically designed for the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller were examined whether there were talking about Trumps's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are involved in campaigns of the Republics as an advisor of the Republics.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to that, Mueller also took a more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote a couple of weeks ago that the Special Rapid Trump personally led to the centre and seek to search for whether the president may disabled people in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide to check if the Indictment should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys will therefore also be one of count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly, they are turned on if it is a larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In addition, the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to download people under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations were issued, which turned around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who participated in the meeting were called to a statement, it was called in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Moreover, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps were also Civil and Jared Jared Kushner as well as his first campaign manager Paul Manafort with the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing said on Thursday night in US television that the objective indication that Mueller does not leave itself in his work unless it should be necessary to deal quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the onset of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new foundation for president Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, President on Thursday evening signed a speech in West Virginia to present Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme give the Democrats a way to feel "feel good because they can't talk about that they can talk."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special consultant Ty Cobb explained in a position he caught nothing of the entry of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this I usually work in the engerms, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House summed all measures that accelerated the work of the special error to "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey has said three times that I would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to accept that something changed in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had been used but had been fired after Trump Comey had been fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this roomeration, the complaints against Trump had become loud, so he decided to impede the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump I asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president stands under large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of U.S. media, the White House of materials collected material against the special company and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about it if Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Other than an independent special talk about the Congress, as in the Watergate affair around the later-known president Richard Nixon, Mueller has found a position in which he could be fired at the presidency of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The more than a trillion tonne heavy and 5800 square kilometers big Koloss toss to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ickers that have registered researchers in the past three decades.</seg>

<seg id="1524">To what extent, climate change has played a role in the demolition of ice hockey, is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual coceries in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be combined with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">So far, Koloss was now part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swimmers on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the front of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the north of the Schelfeat was the balance of waxing and disrupted some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelspring is broken up there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It tells quite a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge have never withdrawn from as far as the front edge.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice top stands voltage and could be broken down, if at a key hand, a piece of key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level not as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it gives after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the scrap shows that the glacier appears directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project focuses on the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest Schelfeat in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the junction of the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "even though it is a natural head and is not aware of direct connection to climate change, the ice plate is now in a endangered position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the record," he confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will continue to grow again or long-term and possibly summarised, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this process will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not bring to change this gigantic iron on climate change, but in the past decades a lot of exams of the Antarctic Peninsula have been broken.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long wing of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the polar surface of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers in the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have been warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it the areas of the fastest stiffness over the world.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Lavendel is recalled due to the conditions of famine and because of the diseases of the insects, some scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, prepared large headache.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to climate change impacts in the past few years, which has much less rain in spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the life of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists will discuss what safer feels: they will take their children with the office which were the goal of an attack with garages in 2009, or let them go at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter to propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary to perceive perceptions and abdominal strings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug adugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being suspected of being forcibly to the government of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which is dangerous for the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no resting period of violence, and during all the country the corpses, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto have registered office in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>

<seg id="1821">The workshop will be held less than two months after his death, and the reporter will discuss their shared themes, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special appeal was erected in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal cases were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are associated with drug trafficking and organizational crimes each year, the murderer are only rarely used by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, it still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are undoubtful and even though the terrain is still abdicated.</seg>

<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. it was forced out from his car and was probably translated to him for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated into "twelve times river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was gone in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to move freely into Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the theme of Valdez, there's practically nothing worth as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloody battlefields of the country, since riveting fractions were battling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of embellous, two-storey mausages for drug, which are bigger than many houses for the Living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forgetting a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader one of the Rival factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have the children's stock, that Gangway bought every copy of the edition as soon as it was extradited to newspaper tiltable.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault that Valdez was not forced to force, after confiscation of another newspaper, who had published the same story to leave the country on his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived to his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Norbeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism, without puncturing the noise of the poison," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper has served a call for the courageous and honourable reporting, and sales and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard working investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by an publication where they could read stories that nobody else was to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot" award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for the Courage of the Mexican drug history, where she always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on" I said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug retailers in Sinaloa "is a way of life," said he in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>

<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite of the office, and sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine of his destruction?</seg>

<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-awareness and self-thought.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative contactate, weak institutions and corrupt government officials will be home.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside, two police officers seek protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who themselves are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug confederates de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three major stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They had also had an exposé to the state spending, focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office, led a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was abducted or as it happened, so it was careful to write when everyone in the city knows what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local by drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that ruled the reign of the Institutional Revolution Party (pri) who ruled all political levels in the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-level corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In particular, Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman passed a military coup.</seg>

<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists and destroy them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since been asked since that she is again divided by the government because it is concerned that her rage has injured its objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant carnivores, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a changing tank, probably by meat fressful dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The severely woven dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before spoiling, and used a shielding technology, which is used as counter-attaching, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to reate his enemies, experts predict that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>

<seg id="1941">In addition, researchers have now studied the wild beast and also called Boreopelta markcharelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shady shady treasures, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady shady usually is surprising, the results are surprising because the size of Boreopelta exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure was chased by meat fressful dinosaurs, that evolution die the sfrontation of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that are deploying the shady shady - think about toe, Zebras or belt animals - are a lot of small and violinist than loot that signalled that this Nodosaurier was a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong pirated behavior on a massive, severely damaged dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs roughs have been to have been the Cretaceous times," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was rotted.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continues to examine the animal regarding his life, including his consercient content to find out what it did as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, was cast into a river and went beyond the sea, where it sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta were so warm like southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably widespread in a way than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with preserved skin, but also kept in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal trap," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks like today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous was a time when huge thermopoden, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two legs, the earth went through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus, lived millions years after Boreopelta, was chased the panzted dinosaurs of some of his furious ancestors.</seg>

<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who would like to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying personnel, check out the DB Navigator just yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter into individual customers needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those often goes by train, knows that in addition to late and missed trains, the tickets must be among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case one of the traveling documents do not have all the documents, which is needed for the validation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or identity document is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train attendant and Fahrmeier, which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays when checking the own tickets and the career at the end takes the time to take care of others.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test clients can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is also available on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell has been shaken by her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after arriving in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented them and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She urged over a post of someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed 18 year old child, and still stands on the street," called it there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one had posted the information on her feedback, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly being offered on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the region of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," thought Ferrell was thinking about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was not new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">You made your mobile phone to turn later on the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be a shield with the wording, "Ferguson Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed at which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barren dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said," "" "I said," "" "I will kill all of you." "" "I will kill all of you all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "reminded the testimony of their testimony." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to ourselves and that we can choose from typically."</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt Schütt.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would take the two next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">There is a history of survival and the protest, the love and of the loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of men who live in the community and the streets filled to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came with her daughter, which brought a flower-dress and a matching crown, drove the two a conversation after Ferguson, which they had countless times before this morning "through the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remembered not how I have taught you when black people have to fight against what they believe?" "" "she reminded her of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "now we go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18 year old boy, and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her, "said Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">They must know and see it and be drawn therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her a experience in which she personally experienced no eklatants of racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far off. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business entity that made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell's appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August. she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student NING Association and focused on essens justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Ferrell later met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell in mind: "would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As I declared recently in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, they didn't centered, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folding had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism around Todistract occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer, along with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us. we're talking," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these men are represented, for so will I be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The target was not to concentrate on heel's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide, but in order to gather together a community, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious of participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">In folgefolds, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be certain poorality during this work and in the realisation of the black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Furthermore, the role of the black swamp women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter exercise is repeated.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founder of the movement who have left the movie "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identifying the movie "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, schwule Women in managerial positions have carried out the movement" "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are battling in different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, schwule Women must bear the last load of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "on the right to notice that" "" "the movement of the black women and many black women are kept upright." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "" "" this is not a subject "" "" ative type of action "" "" where Ferrell has been selected as heart of the film. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who struck this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although she was on the front of the front, because in a life at these crossings, as a black, scule woman standing so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime the telecommunication cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continues.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they caught up for a singing and she feels so far, ever since they went to Ferguson on the streets three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love one another and support it.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"" "from" "" "to" size "" "": TV readers will be discussing over bit gallery. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the person, although it is not yet built for long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area has been spends since the first presentation in 2009, the population in advocate and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly can hardly be found.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Our theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This is really class" (Nicole Schausten), coming from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Bugs) or quite simple: "size of course!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the prince insisted that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the other stores also profit, fear the opponents that then leaves the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned on the grounds, on which the peasant market hall is available, in which 13 direct operators are sold to market.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will end with the start of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda Square with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the estate are always very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butchers have been discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that, during and especially after the building of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are also other cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping cartons in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drous or supermarkets: I find that.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop transactions remain empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since there is not yet a regular weekly market, it is more important to get us at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because all the product offered here is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is in an inexpensive price.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions will be rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms, because its rentals are often not able for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "pity, special transactions there are almost no more and what remains of it, will probably disappear" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a brand hall is not suitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the peasant market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery before, to drive all shops in Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">My view would have been better to promote once a real farm market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market, there is no more space thanks to the madness of many - as I find - sentimeless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market is made, it will disappear again a piece of culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A dedicated similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - which are attached to cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 Portraits have been created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wangen-troops and hairs that you were sent from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analytics took a 35-year-old prison after they had established diplomatic messages via the site of Wikimak.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "Becoming Resemblance (One matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was in their expertise, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgression and pioneering dissertation, whose conviction was converted to Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which could look like someone with these genomic data, a sharp, if also something intellectual records could not only be interpreted as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinants of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, has been open to identification as a woman since their puberty in 2013, including six convicts, including six violation of the spy law, computer, and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison the picture was suppressed, so it was only a single photo - a graveyard, black-white Selfie where she sits clearly on a driver seat and is wearing a platelblonde perimeter - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg returned from the great success of their 2012 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers in forensic artifacts such as cigarette stain and chewing gum by sending the DNA from the waste to make a picture of them, like these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when it received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in prison, and they wanted to accompany him to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg during a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit this time, and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her orprisoned Muse were forced to untie briquor, which exiled several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "supplies images" which would foresee a future, in which the president of Chelseas, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama became only a few days after the book was published, Mannings was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of lucky meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump causes a war against informant from the government and against Transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to solve the rigid spoints, which he should actually fix to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg, after a strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one of the gallery of the gallery, Manning with their oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) at the end of the "automatic disintegration, its foundation, race, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondriale DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific clopaedia of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological regards, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people are hopefully entreated that our genome does not take care of what we are, and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious memories, also to be seen. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one side from the above mentioned Comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she has appeared with a hands-free party in the United States of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they have been cold for your speech, they have won," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never forget your mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "she came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "" "said the artist that greets out of Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get gether, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition yet not personally seen in the book - but when it should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of masks, from their own genomic simulation, which collects like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, as all in the exhibition, until the size (5 "2," Mannings Stature), where their genetic haplogically were written down with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"" "" "" "in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of lives," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits." ""</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed along with Chelsea, like the movement that were also behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is a professor at Northwestern University and a staff of the University of Oxford which had been sought to suspects a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday they issued warrants for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County.</seg>

<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem had now been lurred and have been excluded from the campus of the Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates at this investigation," said Cubry.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman of the University and the Somerville College spoke in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in France and are willing to help the US investigative authorities in any manner."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement was added that Warrens colleague were shocked and want to put himself up.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demanded the suspects of suspects the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their position, and our efforts to allocate them," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities to help suspects the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said, the police got a call from the building stock of the Grand-Plaza building that had just received an enigmatic tip that had something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene than a cruel monster.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident took place on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the sacrifice had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents: "the police currently works on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a wide variety of motifs, including possible hunters."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA schedules in the near future" - the Russian vice versmier Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian vice-mier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) are implemented for restoring the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a given stage of fulfillment of the criteria, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">In this regard, the WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "stated Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for reinstreation of RUSADA, and recently published on the organisation's website.</seg>

<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities approved the reported results of the WADA approved examination by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren on the alleged state of publicly sponsored dopings in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="2189">In terms of the matter, Mutko said: "we lead the examination because our anti-doping system has set an error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there was no state programs, and we will not admit that what does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos agree with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales outlet Rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave me problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "we repeated repeat that the undisputed positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">No one has added to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 as part of Doping Skandals from the WADA from the implementation of Doping control in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the organisation of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA-General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA has moved to "the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the judgment of public opinion has recorded the curators" "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its staff is poorly treated or unethical, it can experience valuable consequences by consumers-boycott, workers-fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent is used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find an telephone number or email for the business center, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an inhospitable and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said, there was no way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convercent may include, problems that were previously sitting in offices in cities or states, have been hiding, such as discrimination, harassment, or uneptive interns, have been identified and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and loading the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that assists the approval of Venture Capital Investors, which supports both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised overall capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzsche took home $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools are talking to third, commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you can find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the employee commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the stock of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks for your feedback, it may have a anticipation that the change is in the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change isn't fast enough, or at all, this disappointments can therefore detachable and detachable employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Guath, President of Consulting at the Business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies to rely on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other News', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly found.</seg>

<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>

<seg id="2397">The user can adjust his robot even according to its beliefs "and do everything from the eye-colour of the robot on the form of the nipple to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will still be worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would look like a Stepper woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone cone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to customize its robots to the properties that they are appealing as timidity.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the true Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives an impression of relentment and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>

<seg id="2405">She may be tired of being fixed on conversation, or it can be "in the mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many bewilful aspects in this promotion of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the underlying female characteristics of rape, if one gets a step forward to Frigid (called here: irresistible) Farrah, troubled them most.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Her birth and her increasing refinement show a little darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal in equality of sexes to a wish of sex with subjugation as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men do not have sex robots, and while FRR indicated its rising popularity, they still remain provisionally on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what age out of the border zones can be leakened with regard to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or jealous until they are the free market for permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that this highly developed sex robots are at a time to appear in which the rights of women worldly are threatened to have a president in which the White House has ordered to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The awesome aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid's') are not the graphic images that affects the unmatched body and the emitted eyes, but as realistic these vision.</seg>

<seg id="2417">The target behind this sex robots exists, a physical activity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your builders refused that they feel themselves in human beings that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots make no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be held from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background history, nothing to independency or any of what the fantasy totalal subjugation could be annoyed.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Differently expressed: they are counterparts slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speeches of 2017:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to understand the sound mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a Binsenwestering of the trump era that the political circumstances which have split the US voters, also families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedanko there were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror by Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We make sure to allow us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices the power of Trumps, Families have been noted.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this, because my cousin, who lives in Chicago, has long been working with the Republicans in our family, who has long visited this week in New York for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It recalled me that the unit can have an enemy effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To make the dining table, the certainly is a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also has significant risks associated with him.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The linke was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his Presidency did power to push all the power to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bib will no longer be found out of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a terrifying long-time scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly in consideration of their standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I found myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romance's comodd version of the decline - the dog on the author, which looked at 14% of income tax (but at least did we know like his tax return) - which both occur in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Cardan's Park Hotel, and the best three dollars which you can spend in the city if you need not caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses have enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crushed and the animals are turning round about her own shoulders - extremely dark and challenging music conveys this in noticeable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clubs are disappointed: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are committed to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city shall not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout located in the north London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-ies can go on it and all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was compelled to evaluate my "experience" with transactions in a scale of up to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee at the corner of my road it is the same as plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually a neutral exchange should be, but also practicing pressure on the server to enter personality in a situation, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman at the department store was excused, while I tired the experience of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to the hospital in the hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison term for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of sitten to his hands that he suffered to the prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder in the prosecuting of the prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's early morning by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightly ruffling, who hid themselves in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say, she was too sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution authority said that it will be held at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and its burden can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is running danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can be used to your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory performers.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the United Kingdom caused magistrates and blasting, recurring or bloody incidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected, the meat and dairy products will be to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contribute to develop a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that Immunology in the intestines of patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes hide themselves in the body, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammations, are balanced by cells, protect the tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tend towards inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance submitting immune cell in mice intended to bear a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterias and Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their nourishment, the more they had taken from these immunity cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan diet is tolerate, less inflammatory intestinal injury, if the same system is effective in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoc capacity Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan visited a kind immunity that promotes the tolerance and found that a group of study mice had such cells, but was not housed in a different group of the same tribe, but had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They thought that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were revealed to DNA sequenzes and were found in six subtypes, which were present in mice with the immunoons, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were moved in a sterile environment, so that they failed to develop a intestinal microbioma and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system, the researchers tested L. reuteri in a fluid and caused little amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant conveyor cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be known as an additional product of tryptophan Metabolism which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of mice, the number of these cells decreased by approximately 50 per cent, but when tryptophan values decreased, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant improving cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect themselves in our gastro-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri should develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we would promote, since these cells control inflamed on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially possible tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri to a expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen site relieves the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report to the abduction of the abbreviated Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historian Michael Eemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse of the Regensburger Domsparatzen continues to take discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissening, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," explained by the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerald Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve to see the appearance of the Catholic Church when Mueller and Ratzinger would blow its deeper regret about its own underground or false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican, "Osservatore Romano," however, criticised that coverage of violence with "two lei" measure can be measured in reporting on violence.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the interventions in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be prevented by "shameful and corrupt actions," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "it is known to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion about to keep it for normal," "" "written Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also in the interview with Bayurn und Taxis in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on the church, and this is a combined Fressen oder."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "Moreover, she pointed out that" "" "they had been a normal pedagogical agent in their youth," "" "to be with joyful children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are not fair, present the standards for earlier decades, since the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Eemann, who was written by Ratzinger the 'My Brother of Pope "(translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Eemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the Bishopric education of Regensburg with the reconnaissance lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 regensburger Domsparrows were sexually violated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plubility of victims, 67 domain sparrows sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarizing that Domenellmeister was employed in many cases physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for the students could even fall severe in high levels.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other words, many victims were estimated that many victims were estimated by R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even more positive memories were united with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Eemann, why the final report on the Missa skandal at the Regensburger Cathedral sparrows Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of violence to the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">A result of bringing many students of his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it is also available as cholesterol and perfectionist who has been handy when a cathedral rate is musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How can you evaluate this final report as its Biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you turn the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger needs to be found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is only devoted to eight pages and is clear by any suspicion of the mid- or miter in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the nonviolence in the preschool occurred outside of his action sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can make any case earlier, of which too late or first interpretations have not been taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "salvation" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and" "" "salvation" "" "was given by almost all respondents." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his pupil Georg Ratzinger describes him a very excellent, "" "" very popular "" "," "" "" excellent "" "," "" "" competent, "" "" and "" "" comprehenvious "" "," the guys regularly with cake, biscuits and bonbons and "" "" always circulated from grapes. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is consistent with its perfectionism and its high Emotivonality that led to Wutausages too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only wear them with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also for the gathering together and too naughty guys to hair or ears, he deeply regret, deeply sadly.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It is said to be honourable, however, that such guardian methods were in fragile time, 1960s and 1970s, with parents, as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced that in a worldwide school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually seen in this report, namely, the entail sexual abuse and the nonviolence at the preschool, are the freilding Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then one asks, whether it was not more acquainted with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media fell just upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">The Bavarian Pope did not work many who have never understood it, still being eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report unloaded Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report very much about the topic of abuse during Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also apply any winding or mitriment regarding sexual abuse of load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults committed to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never have given me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a interested standing representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they confided not to parents and siblings, then definitely not a chorus, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of failure?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Eemann: a questionable pupil it formulated like: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he would have had his insights (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had been delayed.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for really absurd, assume that... Buben einrupenetration or more recently opened, as opposed to their parents, internatswers, confidentists, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus, the report comes to a clear result: "that in the advance of the affected students and / or their environment, the investigation could not be confirmed."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is so free from anyone seeking abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It can't be accused of having to prevent him from or to display him.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring his good name with this rebellious crime in connection, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, much of "violent" could be read from the Regensburger Domspatzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The report of the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is being thrown in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this approach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Eemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and menaced to a giant melange from sexual abuse and violent seizure, in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is being clean: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the Domspatzen plant.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test education, the cases, in which boys of sadist teachers were regularly screened and malignited, all of them occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where truly skillous states have to have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to her face when she had already been a high school teacher.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the way, like most of the witnesses, the theme "Preschool" taboo. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to come from her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraegic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was on the domain or high school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Eemann: there was even discipline, but no saabian violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, with which the report comes to conclude that "many victims were the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories of him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most, the precursor to have been carried away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was given only two time periods where it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and from their predecessors at a school, at which he did not have been and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently wear the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Eemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domebatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this respect, he pointed out that, "that in the preschool, the test was still practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the periorative preselection process he predicts intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test penalties in Bavaria had been banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that time it occurred in a legal grey zone, as every one of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate it too much, where the affected could possibly be overdone or dramatic, and where truly the allowable limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have been torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The exam for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it is not fair to turn back today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Eemann: we are talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger, past to present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has been right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abagated at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of offence and violence at innocent children's school, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it is finally ready.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds to discipline and punishment, so earths and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment then he was forbidden, too, it has also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his Regensburger period has given Georg Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of examining also for language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Eemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedictates XVI, tells of his perspective, and the Domsparrows played only a part role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not able to soften that he led a thorough regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said to be once said: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of world transiders, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bony alone one makes no great singers and before every success, in which area, always discipline, passion and self-winorating.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what a man did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Eemann: through the work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really quite well and always experienced his wonderful, humorous, deep believing and warm good people, of whom you could not imagine that he could do anything that only a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domsparrows are still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him regularly, visit him - he is almost blind - and him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not given him up to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domes are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, väteral teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectsperson, to which they still look up today and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, yet, once again clearly: all that should be prescribed for him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominence and another prominent brother has to make a medial fall-bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil purpose that stands behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of interest would have had a 93-year-old man who would have acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
