gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gains the pil@@ es of stones
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lang@@ er sought a little variation with some colleagues at a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes , the horses remin@@ ded their closing night , they pursued the fast gal@@ lop of home to the feeding branches .
one kilometer during this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the e@@ quest@@ rian arri@@ ers ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he led to his family through the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he couldn &apos;t look at photo@@ co@@ als .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe encour@@ ages the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala of Golden Athlet@@ es .
there won &apos;t be hon@@ est@@ able athletes of the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Ar@@ rest Cross , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour players of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already applied him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the pil@@ es of stones .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for they are not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lang@@ he has been promoting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more outstanding athletes competing in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the events were born : athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schm@@ itt , who is acting on Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ is@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@
many of these sports participants came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society mig@@ rated to the jum@@ per stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - which is to both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
un@@ one are the two US presidential candidate at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are based on a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy will harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton to regul@@ ate the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be completely different , said Tr@@ ump .
he will drive some ra@@ uli@@ ers massi@@ vely , and he makes himself a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton against that says : the state has appointed certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money .
that is why the tax for the rich is increased , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton become almost wor@@ t@@ ely .
the democratic candidate , announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are the classic @-@ democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical team @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so there could be an internal discussions on the tr@@ ump .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and res@@ ili@@ ze coal plants in the US again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris Climate agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to expand and ur@@ ges the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will make the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only for infrastructure - also at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far away from each other .
T@@ PP , which is a trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both of them want to ins@@ ulated the United States by the international trade , but simply protect American jobs .
they then should be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
what tr@@ ump in this question is not clear : once say he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ on , then he says he will not be changed .
but the great discussion of the next months is likely to develop more about the control policy of both bearings .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ load the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics have before him , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton says that at least from the rich he wants to pay more tax , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who alone will flee , almost as long as everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often sad .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
each has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has laid her little son into the arm .
he sn@@ ails with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother st@@ icky on the table top .
till it is noticed that it is observed .
they sm@@ iling short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is part of Con@@ dro@@ bs division , a sponsor for social auxiliary offers in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Relief Association .
it has recently been opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made on her run experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically pursued because of them torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope to Europe , &quot; says it .
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honor of honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives her away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that t@@ ug@@ boat for a bottle of water for a bottle of sexual action is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , tell B@@ ahr .
the standing women would often be regarded as a min@@ d@@ ful women in refugee quot@@ as often and ab@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the Munich &apos;s North , is sad and estimates .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are as usual that they can say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trust not to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not need to help others , it need more accommodation only for them , requ@@ est@@ ing B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven district ra@@ ins are responsible for the placing of refugees .
to the question whether they w@@ asted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no .
in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something that should not be found in governments of governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women alone are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press review of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia are available in some common floors or their own houses only for single and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the European Parliament &apos;s rights and gender equality must also be challenged by women to be separated from men .
in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are set up separately . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for lack of privacy or become men and women , it can come to - for@@ getting - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , in the study .
like the women of this protection need , one can read on And@@ alu@@ d , which there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; since that time has been spoken , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could make a second house lightly .
assist@@ ants strike : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new jobs
as representatives of the assist@@ ants , their union representatives will be called to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has required its entire Council , from the beginning of September more working relief measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that it was ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go to the concerns relating to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assist@@ ants and medical students have voted on the re@@ jection of a contract to agreement with BM@@ A on July 2014 .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday night on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government had remained &quot; been quiet@@ ly quiet &quot; to problems , what was denied that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of what the J@@ DC board voted to complete the proposed new contract in complete and un@@ official new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board appointed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of calendar work measures that begins in early September .
the disp@@ utes reported that assistant doctors of this year began six times , the first total events in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A assistant doctors , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana was the head of the agreed contract conditions , which had been suggested by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical assist@@ ants that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jeremy Hunt , said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be implemented .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external vibr@@ ations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and the official end of the eight months of lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter in the gilded hall in the St. Petersburg Palace of St. Petersburg , I cannot make sure that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation .
there was the action , yes .
but putting into the smile had its nar@@ row@@ ly and radi@@ ated warmth , even for his rest@@ rained conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an spoke to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had so ben@@ evol@@ ve , than that would never happen something worse .
my enthusiasm seemed to me rather the opposite .
but one of Putin was brilliant , sustainable cooling showed that the Russian state of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ alled burning .
Putin divi@@ des and accused Ankara to withdraw Russia into the back .
the insur@@ rection was even bigger , since it was committed by a good friend .
the show@@ cases re@@ build again will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media initiated a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once it seemed to be , the Turks would bear all the gu@@ ilt .
most seriously , the alleg@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials were benef@@ ited from their own family from illegal oil retailers in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look back .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin was trying to ap@@ preh@@ end the President of the President Erd@@ og@@ an that he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice are clear at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs primarily all friends who can get received after he became the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic images .
Russian sanctions were hard hit in Turkey - in particular , the ban of char@@ ters that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and bat@@ ches will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ oc@@ onal side tower in the Mediterranean .
this week , the national television appro@@ ached fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural products are imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i formulated this way : &quot; tourists &quot; &quot; tourists &quot; long &quot; &quot; &quot; long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is we@@ al@@ able in the West , since its reaction to power was considered a weak answer .
to this end , the continued h@@ anger of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian state @-@ of state won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat for the chosen state of State .
that is well @-@ known for Moscow a self @-@ intelli@@ gible , which has changed a deeper fear@@ ful fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ zer .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in the sea enabled the Russia and Turkey , one as it described me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of out@@ sider &quot; : two countries who are cat@@ ching off from the West and po@@ or@@ ly treated so bad@@ ly .
nonetheless , despite the public conc@@ iliation , there are always great differences between the two others .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace of peace , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sites .
it might be significant that after almost three hours , both pre@@ sidents appeared on the press conference , said they would not have under@@ gone the topic once .
the President of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize it .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator could be found in Syria .
but after months open host@@ ilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , as NATO member Turkey declared the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland are no longer available
according to the board of directors of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a Back@@ office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland .
by Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand have been connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself so far , when it had had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; brand @-@ mounted brand &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have been used to protect other end consumer brands .
she supported the international sports with millions of Â£ in sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by until the Wimbledon winner of Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to look more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the central head office and the stock market will switch to Nat@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private clients that will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees are employed , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are no global targets , but local objectives .
each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working under these stamps .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsor@@ ing no longer , and that it will increase the perc@@ eptions of the various brands in their sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time to develop itself to the bank of brands , for how we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very c@@ yn@@ ical , if we said we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think it will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy that it &apos;s been at New@@ market , because I landed some 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a band Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am ligh@@ tened and modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori occupies the Ju@@ bel , when he brings the victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction .
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the ste@@ ep@@ est race in the ste@@ ep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 times winner of Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time D@@ ed@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career bars
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone in just days before it .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct , who distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusi@@ astic fans for this sport since years .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already won 6.000 winn@@ ings when he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has won almost 30 years of winning players , what &apos;s great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition it is an incredible vintage jo@@ ckey .

three years ago , at the beginning , he had left trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month sperm , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fer his branches and return to his best .
and yet it &apos;s not yet a long time at the end of the D@@ ett@@ ori last year , that he wants to continue in cont@@ ests until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin hum@@ ert Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin reli@@ eved his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the close contact of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport issues .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin was de@@ ferred under his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was the deputy @-@ representative of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital , Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of log head and administration of the government &apos;s government .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of government to assist your activity as state @-@ of @-@ of @-@ the law and insp@@ ections on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ade the sm@@ iling Fac@@ es ?
this stage has made secret lost in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of a close contact of Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV in television , both men deemed that the Chief of Staff was re@@ directed at his own request .
but despite being a lot for cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections .
is this a consequence of a kind of power combat ?
the one knows no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once glorified as a potential President was to lead to even the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin I said Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation between the beginning of 2012 - they could have been very complicated - they could have been able to trust - requ@@ est@@ able for four years .
as it emerged , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as a former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Aviation Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov became deputy chairman of his deputy .
when Putin met his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in most of them .
once , Ivan@@ ov was supposed to be President of Russia in Put@@ to the second term of President of Russia , since a third term of putting into the Constitution had been cast against the constitution .
but this item was taken by another , near @-@ end ally plaster , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became a president in three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he smote producers
Gibson was also involved in a physical con@@ front@@ ation at the Set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his termination in a common position .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , l@@ act@@ himself on Thursday before the announcement of his notice .

Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the Â£ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ds of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which near the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rotary valves .
the Â£ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy K@@ eit@@ h Brown was appointed a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of a short@@ fall in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ fer activity that require extreme precise tolerances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of all Br@@ Ã¼ck@@ ende@@ cks in their place and the last part of the de@@ cks are in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents a tr@@ end@@ setting top and deep construction .
after the installation of the last street @-@ section and its connection with the northern northern hemisphere , we had to close the still existing gap on the North or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern town bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ icky job .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , approx . 6,000 tons , and at a gradient of approximately 3 % had to be moved .
fin@@ cle because the tolerances , which the team is working , they were tiny - at each side , it amounted to only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we looked like the boat in its proximity to turned and brought us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the life station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; than@@ k@@ fully , the strong winds ble@@ w up the boat except of its reach until we left water , &quot; he added .

who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs low apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors are expected to be taken much stronger in the future .
how to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 inexpensive dwellings in the coming years ?
the SPD suggests the next ratings for the &quot; Action Concept Living . &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are pleased to build us with the Green : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to exhibit as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the affordable housing can however also be made in our inventory .
however , the grand pi@@ v@@ ot in the Town Hall is however , called Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you go with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but preferably 20 percent of dwellings as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new residential building programme that will cost millions and will be financed even to incenti@@ vi@@ ze .
the problem so viol@@ i : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as short as possible .
the lin@@ ke wants even more rigi@@ dity for investors .
regardless of these , viol@@ i , ex@@ h@@ ort a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the skilled workers .
however , the program is not completely completely : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be tra@@ ded in .
but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose mining is going to go out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ing spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought for the current ties of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about it to bring apartments back to the bond .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
one fell on a blow to solve the problem .
the west city run to the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could take you back to the price of favorable flats .
only : this will not want to do the owners , housing corpor@@ ations .
because the number of social con@@ domin@@ iums in the West@@ stadt will be dra@@ stically increased again , one is the aim of the so @-@ called tran@@ spl@@ ash .
a concentration of social cont@@ emp@@ t in just a few districts should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens said that there will be motion in the discussion .
leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a wide majority the CDU have to be made with the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating , how the world has changed .
that teen@@ ager and child did not go beyond outside , but rather prefer@@ able to spend their free time in doing on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it will cause people to collect and active people from the sofa .
the time at the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and last@@ ly limited to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are unable to exclu@@ de each other .
I inter@@ connect myself of course to the Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created for video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , games cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture sunk the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand which over@@ load the servers .
within few days , Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ ym@@ s and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go with their smartphone outside , looking for Pok@@ Ã©@@ m@@ ons that will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found once , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which reg@@ ained the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
with Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 users , announced that the Washington Post informed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , that j@@ ump@@ ed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go - only the raw data of the performance increase .
many public awareness campaigns to take up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day to be active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are bo@@ red and people are coming to everyone who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly drives sport , reduces his opportunities to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to run it here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that there are people to do something in the open , that fun makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health benefits - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close the hunt for new friends .
as always there are m@@ Ã¼r@@ g game destro@@ ys , that must always be compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone Apps were already able to follow our activity as Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game .
the new will lose his matur@@ ation and the use will be returned with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will join apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people in the hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the j@@ umping horse .
effort@@ less on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic Champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ ands on Thursday to the multi event title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
the overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team nationals A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ keys on the Swedish brothers during the single majority of women in the arts at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual amer@@ ican player , who wins a combined campaign and had a total of the fifth , while she is a reputation to be the best of its generation or even ever .
it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was at the end .
this success introduces it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought her sports with new heights :
it has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world champion - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected it a last test in Brazil , a competition , which was not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather , between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful of gold to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , after they have gained gold and silver in the individual combined events of women in the arts at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
it took the first medal to Tuesday during the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a call@@ sign .
even though it insi@@ sted on the top of having planned the future , this is not really true .
a part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would match at home on the street outside of the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
that is not acci@@ dental .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no more lost competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak which will hold so long as it wishes .
even if pattern was slightly led by two tor@@ ches , the picture suspended the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ et and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which image stops the world title - lau@@ ded .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating floor again - and placed one on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her to her final bur@@ ial - pure form@@ ality and tears in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue p@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collective book to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went on a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team competition , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
according to their ground exercise , she designed the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly appeared .
as a result , the rapidly spread of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a brand new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mur@@ der@@ ers killed during musical listening in the car
according to police report , which were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who were killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks on a decade in the first serial port of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a pilgrimage .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight sh@@ uts out of a hand fire@@ arm while sitting on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another car , is read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of an smo@@ ker all @-@ over , since the attack@@ er didn &apos;t carry the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting started investig@@ ating a investig@@ ator to see if it is connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven attacks were killed in nine attacks seven people within four months , and two more injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house &quot; organized by Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to prove the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are associated and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised by their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died .
a witness to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities have also published a police report on the shooting , which ended up an empty Pick@@ up @-@ Truck up half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial port .
investigations found pat@@ ron@@ g@@ uts and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ zep@@ ool : &quot; it &apos;s better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his age@@ ing did Edmund micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorders that knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought I was not .
I will not make it .
I didn &apos;t let me down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right -- of course - of course , you told it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has informed her husband Vincent and her husband , that Edmund she may never recogn@@ ise under any circumstances that he may not survive one time .
some doctors even went so far that they struck him to support him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; explained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a remedy .
Edmund continued to sit cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year of life , neither can he talk yet .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run and biking with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character call@@ sign , which Edmund for &quot; Please sing something &quot; out of &quot; . &quot;
&quot; we give him a character language in &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character set -- says it . Edmund has found some signs alone .
micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund , and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is too early to say how to influence the life of the av@@ av@@ irus @-@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional prize of a certain future .
I question@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have no longer asked for the forecast for a long time because I don &apos;t expect it to really say goo@@ db@@ ye to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with native injuries caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I pre@@ ach@@ able to help me among women &apos;s Olympi@@ ad in the Tur@@ nen and that is more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ ing many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the JÃ¼@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is cath@@ olic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has been the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast , one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year was Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America during the last Olympic Games .
now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible achievement of the three @-@ fold world champion , Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they had expected , but most widely used Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone , the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual men , who won women for women in an individual combined event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experi@@ encing the top of this sport , but this is not visible classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ashed all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic script will only have four pairs of tur@@ ers in the team . in addition , Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi was the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality is that spl@@ itting a more expensive sport is and Turner &apos;s primarily associated with parents that are waiting for training , entry , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these societies , Turner receive its total training and for the families a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since it started with the tower .
we must make the municipalities of Au@@ n numerous , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a safe and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
for my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ ast@@ eries in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) offered by national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer a high @-@ quality tower to learn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination of the body as well as hard work , discipline and setting for the spirit .
this combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for the school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
that is so exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with a different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggest@@ ion
the ministers agreed to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants , who abst@@ ained from election .
in July , Hunt plans revealed to lead the treaty and said that N@@ HS had to be employed in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land &quot; associations and any further delay for employees and patients .
the first assistance of assistance should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ - and weekend work to improve care of continuous movements .

at only eight weeks that remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by BM@@ A contribute to the solution of disp@@ utes ar@@ ising with regard to government &apos;s government and sometimes leads to coh@@ er@@ ful swe@@ ep .
that was the meaning of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made this last month , that his door would always open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to act now to lift up the action and the wor@@ ries of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , he did not have the assistant doctors that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 sched@@ ules , since n@@ urses and medical doctors were included in order to grant doctors on strike post@@ code cover .
the ministers promised to finish the dispute over the modifications by an acceptance of the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , encouraged the assistance of assist@@ ants to strike the strike .
Mor@@ ti@@ dy said : &quot; labour measures reach nothing but the just a little , but already more load@@ able teams and service providers and prepare for the patient , care and their families are wor@@ ried , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months , we have been talking to the committee of assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries a positive impact on the concerns relating to the officers and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employ@@ ers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as aston@@ ishment , flexibility in training , training courses and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign that health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness levels may flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the occasion of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ dence has led to the pro@@ ving elec@@ toral fr@@ aud in Muslim congregations will be ignor@@ ant like a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es ri@@ p@@ ens the police , election agent and Rath@@ geber for it to ignore the evidence of elec@@ toral violence related to eth@@ nic@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government now , which is now a ant@@ acid disc@@ ern@@ ess , said that the in@@ firm@@ ities of voters from religious moti@@ ves should be simply that the police should be permitted to protect shut@@ ters outside of election cabins in order to protect pi@@ vot@@ al voters .
he recommends that voters should have a identity card to prove their identity in the elections .
at present , a voters must name only his name and address .
the report suggests , non @-@ ink ink on the fingers of a person when they vote their elec@@ toral vote to prevent som@@ eb@@ ody cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should obtain more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official administrative or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election @-@ election , but also the municipal government plans to protect against the wider corruption and financial ul@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the East of London .
last year , a special report decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be moved to a lit@@ eral on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; and had per@@ ver@@ ted his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ ame .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that the reli@@ es of Muslims has been to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ ted or consequence of a follow @-@ up , where one person cho@@ oses other than someone other .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fr@@ aud in the whole country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community had made print on people to choose a candidates of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the guide to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that printing on protection members had exercised several ethnic min@@ orities , particularly women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ an@@ dic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were obj@@ ections to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state institutions such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning eth@@ nic@@ ities as well as religion could be ignor@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban being made political activists material to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is made by Ther@@ esa May is required , demands the tough@@ er registration investigations to prevent that the elec@@ toral folder is used for immig@@ ration and social welfare purposes .
for options , select elec@@ tors prior to your selection .
do not take distance ink on the finger of a person as soon as it has given her voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on assign@@ ments to automatic post@@ ure sel@@ ector .
ban on political activ@@ ist and envelop@@ es of correspondence .
the police give the request of locking points for election stations .
a bill of law that invol@@ ve an charge for in@@ compliance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( German Federal Law of Law 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ers in election stations .
request that only English may be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( excluding Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the workout to ensure that the staff will rule over the rule that voters want to go alone into the turn@@ tables alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no pen@@ al display .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral Court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ eral on corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ ly explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons for in@@ suff@@ iciently - according to the high demands on the criminal procedure - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the elections of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said , &quot; The court sur@@ fer in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country is as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud inheritance , but the poss@@ essing and deep@@ ening of poll@@ s and emp@@ t@@ ance of some authorities re@@ thre@@ aten this good reputation .

fans of the 2016 Olympics are viewing this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , apart from the edge and band , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ rate of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ics in this summer is far not the only one to fight gold fighting Ath@@ let who has his own famous bi@@ ans - at least not if you may remember the social media faith .
to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ ads which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with the Hollywood @-@ famous .
the fighter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from the person Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , a lot of people on the Internet , as a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the Team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after some pictures where he looks like a w@@ olf of Wall Street star out of secret .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness to the social media with and gave that he had already heard her childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself do not see a great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a happy guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will be und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly coming to the center : the simil@@ arity between the British wide range Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through to the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ in .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one ais@@ le higher : this user is of view that Nathan the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor is
another sustained comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ h who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ on@@ ary hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ est@@ ed to Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; an athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only one : one Twitter user was very happy about that other the simil@@ ar@@ ities are also abandoned .
the theory has been made in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of a couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter mar@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet think that Hope and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous spot , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ em@@ .com could make it a little saf@@ er for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to tackle armed rob@@ bers at the nearby distance .
regardless of whether you come from the front or from behind it will show you this video as you turn the sk@@ ewer for your th@@ iev@@ es .
if you att@@ aching to you from behind , then you should see to see your attack@@ ers and enter &quot; from the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon before your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
beat him with the kne@@ e into the l@@ ath and turn it down , while the attack@@ ers collap@@ sed from pain . beat the weapon from his hands . beat the weapon on the face and move on back@@ ward while they set the weapon on him .
when you are attack@@ ing , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the gun and turn them away so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
sei@@ ze the weight at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before moving forward and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
check out the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it &apos;s in a prey on the saf@@ est way to surprise your money - as long as you are no Kra@@ v Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ itting Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to put his tongue on the most dirty places of Europe
a British travel subject to its immune system and dig@@ nity of a serious examination - having dra@@ ining some of the most poll@@ uted and f@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar sites in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and vo@@ y@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will hand over to a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a pull @-@ out space as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system .
in front of the le@@ ak every object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show yourself and show us what he turns .
but the experiment , that was filmed by the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results of daylight .
the thought to hide the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull @-@ out space which has already been used by thousands of others , can be fully e@@ ased , but actually there are more poor bacteria .
in his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily nothing left everything he left , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things as well as wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from public money to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing n@@ ul@@ ls of toilets , the task turned his immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns and I have put all things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in his film he was just righteous for his call .
the only thing that he was refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his dent@@ ures showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ance of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to be refused after their lumin@@ ance had over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a little less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial population at different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst thing that I have ro@@ asted in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;ll feel nothing at this , because there is indoor use here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company took Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .

we performed crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that we finished saying &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
it claim that the interest in health business is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the significance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and we could provide the consumption of more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , said : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , when he had tast@@ ed some of the things I have instructed to him , like the ek@@ y Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things , where it was sim@@ pler , Ian , to bring it , and others where this was quite hard .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of this dirty le@@ ak@@ eup on film . &quot;
in a survey carried out from the year 2015 , 84 percent of those question@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ og@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ z , Corn@@ wall
a con@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a delay in the amount of Â£ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ um@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall cast .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from her estate , sho@@ cked people of housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ rever@@ able state .
the walls were abandoned , wood sh@@ ri@@ m@@ ps have been raised , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on a floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to walls .
the family were moved and it is believed to live in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they feared not to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I &apos;m the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this estate is probably not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and her call is also .
the couple had three sons , the temporarily lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had given the family , street strug@@ gles with bas@@ eb@@ ooks , ad@@ mis@@ ery of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drugs and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an order for anti @-@ electronic behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under circumstances , old litter is found .
in the property , in which the past drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wooden di@@ ps have been torn .
neighbours said they wanted to fight them on the streets and called the police regularly !
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed them and their partners to leave this week , after having a prolonged period of 11 weeks for an extended period of 11 weeks .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neigh@@ bors who told her life to hell .
one said , &quot; They were interested in vain . &quot;
we lived 20 years in addition to them and it was bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , wherever they are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was ab@@ duc@@ ed the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years .
on the over@@ coming side of the Municipal House , gar@@ bage and old toys were sunk
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the Mi@@ l ab@@ hor@@ des to assume any responsibility for their behaviour and her family as a Del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing has taken into account .
that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely fear@@ ful and their deeds for her neighbours had to be broken .
I guess all the work , my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church which have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information provided .
I hope that the development of some neighbours is consol@@ ation and the message will not be toler@@ ated that ant@@ is@@ o@@ idal behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress included in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation left on the floor
workers of the house management are now heated by a land@@ fill , the house surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police arrested a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of Â£ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine penalty after it was found guilty of the possession of a drug B in trade .
it claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 by a car accident .
after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation at Plymouth .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not stick a r@@ enter , which do not stick to the rules of house
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall wrote that Del@@ og@@ ation had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the rules of house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who may remember that they have been killed without self @-@ deduc@@ tions , as well as to those who were killed by such a behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ political behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .

the Air Force declared that it was on a training flight , but waited on that no security risk was canc@@ eled .
this was the moment , in the fri@@ gh@@ tened tourists start to grow in pan@@ ic after an ti@@ effect jet about a full beach crashed .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ancy went up when they under@@ stand@@ able to make worry about the noise of the nozzle tra@@ pped , without fir@@ stly to see what came through the clouds at her .
the incident happened yesterday in the afternoon at Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the countless artists who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it descended . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just at surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down to me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved in pan@@ ic as the plane escaped from the darkness and it was incredibly low .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on aircraft was found on a training flight to identify f@@ ish@@ boats before the coast and thereby had to fly out that this was the only possibility to recogn@@ ise them .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet is slightly lower than usual in the vicinity of bad view conditions . however , the Air Force was able to end@@ ure that the safety of no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four men came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly in due to the ratios - a strong b@@ m@@ ist and bran@@ t - as low as its vision was reduced .

Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting the first step towards the first step in the new soccer season .
the Catal@@ ans qu@@ arri@@ ed in Du@@ eling around the Spanish Super cup starting to FC Sevilla , the return is rising for three days later in Camp Nou .
the Dou@@ ble@@ Tree needs to compete in the forces with the underground Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reg@@ ained Europe @-@ League Champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar who den@@ ies the Olympic Football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e are also missing .
the Germans suffered a change @-@ dust in the kne@@ e with which the ser@@ en@@ quiries regarding Bar@@ ca should be clari@@ fied at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Stadium in Barcelona have been one number one for two years now .
coach Luis En@@ rique is ren@@ ounced on a clear decision on so far and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but that T@@ er St@@ egen enters most of the remaining acqu@@ is@@ itions .
prior to the first mandatory match of the new season , there are doubt about the Spanish team of the team , who hum@@ bled Saturday in a test match of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ spect@@ acle against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. is still not really convincing .
Sevilla opened the 2 : 3 defeat after receiving the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid to di@@ gest the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with its eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in a separate league in p@@ ong @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis @-@ Olympic Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a single finals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the world premi@@ er lists the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournament and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ che@@ ani .
the two Chinese were made as expected in the final match and made the title one another .
this was clear that for the third time a Chinese won the single titles in the sign of the five rings .
the last non @-@ chin@@ ese war on the top of the Olympia was the former SV S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the record alone , between the movements and during time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they had pulled off the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their tra@@ stu@@ ds in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches till I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been tor@@ tured for me in the finals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma was really strug@@ gling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first proposition .
after that , he pointed out the temp@@ o at the top and dropped by 13 points , only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma was not developing the expected exciting match .
but there were not enough stunning ball change to see .
Mi@@ ron@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ze had emerged in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was afterwards in medical treatment , was forced to settle &quot; with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump Lo@@ t â³ hard problems â³ in the campaign fight
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , also in traditional con@@ serv@@ atives states .
presidential candidate of Donald Tr@@ ump now announced the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can High@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a less moment , in which the normally large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals of his own Republi@@ can camp within his own Republi@@ can camp , now doubt the doubt about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Evangelical Christians who asked for support in major federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
false reports are false reports on his candidate , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media reports .
Republi@@ can Se@@ ated W@@ ack@@ ing
Ut@@ ah is normally a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
as a pol@@ l of Surv@@ ey@@ s in June , Tr@@ ump and its competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump , however , not by the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state of Germany .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be end@@ angered .
in an interview of the transmitter of CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump on the question as he had to stop the advance of the Clin@@ ique : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and if back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make any other thing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich in order for the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is the order , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump has to pay attention to the support of its elec@@ toral campaign , it should not be able to present no better rec@@ ess values .
instead of its wool , you can reach the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress stronger than arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister Sc@@ am with D@@ oping test
the IOC will be set up a disciplinary committee for the IOC .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second d@@ oping aff@@ air at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
a coach sent home on a d@@ oping control during a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village .
the International Olympic Committee divided up an order to investigate the case in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian func@@ tionary told that the former Sprinter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village is a ur@@ ine @-@ rehear@@ sal under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team leader Ken@@ ias from the d@@ oping control centers .
the IA@@ AF world association has gained information on the case in order to rig@@ orous his own studies , the IA@@ AF is an IA@@ AF project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will cause an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was written in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and emerged as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated ken@@ es Chef de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list of training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i joined the Beijing World Cup in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan female athlet@@ ics delegation Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to have informed about money @-@ payments of his country about the following d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly was arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
as recently as many d@@ oping control , Kenya has already been under special observation since a long time .
during the announcement of the IOC &apos;s more than 2000 d@@ oping targets before the Rio Olympics , it was previously pointed out that athletes of Kenya and Russia could be taken into vis@@ or .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency led a lot of pressure on African country in front of the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was approved a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
in a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya started from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won the most medals in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , the German charts have always been raised again that in Kenya d@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there is a substantial ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ s .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und claimed a similar study in Kenya , as he had used it in Russian female Athlet@@ ics .
it could be proved that this sport @-@ type surface and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival highlights the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as portable lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ ward masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli did the musical in the temple of the classical music and was filled with Mary &apos;s role in youth .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Symphony led to the management of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in her pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we truly have Bern@@ st@@ ain music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she is remin@@ is@@ cent of her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there were Mari@@ as Personal@@ ity .
she says it in her song : &quot; I like Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh , Pre@@ t@@ ty , I like Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very similar to me to my Italian character , whom I taught as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so great for us to work with her .
it is a monster of man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is for him a need .
you see it in every of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share these musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the American director Philip W@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ conception and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have passed the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York population did not want them .
the same issues are the same topics , and they are exactly the same as the same time .
59 years later , it is still relevant .
London School Girl , which joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school students , left in London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after their family shortly after she had previously left the war@@ fare country and returned to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder , and warning to others that these are the risks associated to go in a war zone - people ever want to make this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the East of Lon@@ d@@ ons increased in a plane in Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas Family has been informed that they have married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months there was a widow .

Tre@@ ats wants to have neck calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere in order to release a 1970 @-@ year Pi@@ relli inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ ics for 2017 .
the editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us early this year that his naked magazine of classic school Play@@ boys are colorful as &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; . &quot;
I do it for women .
apparently , he is the view that the calendar does also do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classical neck , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass repression
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on wrapped suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Presidency of the GÃ¼@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish municipality in Germany anticip@@ ates a short term of thousands of protective seek@@ ers who fled to Germany from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term it might even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believed the subject of the Group president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard passing of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , after the attempted p@@ utsch of the Turkish president , the Kur@@ dish congregation in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term I reck@@ oning with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term , with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Group president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already crossed high bur@@ ging against pen@@ alties before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey at the run .
after the failed coup , se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added .
many will continue to start in Europe if it is further ex@@ presses in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assi@@ sts himself refugees in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee of Staff accused the targeted investment of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ish cities .
consequently , Erd@@ og@@ an may increase the voyage to the remaining cur@@ sor .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were even wi@@ ped out in the last one hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CDU member .
the post @-@ president demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; hex@@ ag@@ hunting &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics are also held .
in the last months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the GÃ¼@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire market as a quality tra@@ ilers destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics in professional existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on wrapped suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len foundation for Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
like the newspaper stated on appeal to the German Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks reported the biggest group of asylum in Germany in front of the coup of political persecution in Germany .
for the reporting date June 30 , this will be 11.@@ 386 people , thus almost 29 percent of all authorised as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9,@@ 625 ) .
this collection won &apos;t be found in front of war , poverty or Per@@ c@@ tiv@@ eness .
asylum in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so from state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where we &apos;re going to go , &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : the loc@@ als get nothing of summer presidential campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern they understood them .
the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as to date , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and de@@ fer@@ oci@@ a combat - that bit@@ es itself .
the loc@@ als that are to be impressed by the candidates , are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the countryside , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ Ã¼gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not loc@@ als , so are not allowed to choose the land .
practical problems include : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , spread the posters , fl@@ yers fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and count on the end of the votes only .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to pass over again to Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern once again for election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D will cut and what remains at the end of the runner @-@ up .
S@@ ing , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous round campaign , one can see from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the land , spread forth ros@@ es and pl@@ u@@ cked out a little with the people , as it did most legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff predecessor .
otherwise , sail@@ ering can get cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel em@@ bo@@ unded the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;re creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the legal op@@ uli@@ sts what will now cost him to the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top @-@ class data , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced as it is when you w@@ rest@@ ling to the wrong time at the right place of elections .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel on major expl@@ or@@ ations ; Merkel parliament is in the northeast .
but the target group did not so , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he probably was the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent co@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no man &apos;s eman@@ ating from other corners of Germany , once in Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU relate to the usual election levels on market spaces and shopping m@@ alls with sun umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , co@@ king , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that in the country their base fires that it must be very severe , to find a wire to the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the times of the land hardly available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Council of the CDU elections to his fel@@ low@@ soldier is also self @-@ related : &quot; you have to go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wedding receptions , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot on the game is , the S@@ ing S@@ DP is called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats currently last with 22 percent behind Partner CDU ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD still had a clearly won 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , want to create the jump into the land .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holidays and lay their elec@@ toral campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; states the president of Claudia MÃ¼ller .
otherwise , green elec@@ tors are based on track search for local ab@@ stain@@ ing of the holidays .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ it@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house boat through the Mecklenburg Lake L@@ akes and it is still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from bar@@ ri@@ ers
at the speed of speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing about square .
for the leaders of the construction work which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only ending at 20 o &apos;clock , there are always praise to praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all things are quite cro@@ chet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no delay .
the building site was scheduled to be transferred to the South at the start of October , and by the end of October everything will be ready .
once again the entity is responsible for the construction works , for example , when it comes to the establishment of house drives .
since the construction site was collap@@ sed on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straÃe in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was removed and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been relaxed and relaxed within the resort .
citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the exploitation by the place seems to return .
&quot; there were partly considerable problems , &quot; says the Deputy Head of the Interim Management of Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ut@@ straÃe , Stein@@ l@@ erst@@ raÃe , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raÃe and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to battle with more traffic noise , because many sn@@ aps searched for their Nav@@ i and trusted in their Nav@@ i .
what led to that , some trucks in residential areas have under@@ gone .
as the speed lim@@ bs were not observed , the community called for the brass vehicle of M@@ Ã¶s@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable over , &quot; says King , who made itself on site about the location .
there were already two to three per minute .
the fastest speed was at a speed of 77 hours at a speed of 77 hours .
it has been moved to the construction site since the construction site .
for the staff at the B 27 , there is only a small consol@@ ation for customers coming from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to the road again .
they don &apos;t have to look at the cards .
but , however , that the B 27 reconstruction has led to them in sales mer@@ ges , everyone that asks , can look through .
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who are less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other firms , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most light decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but certainly also known that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lear@@ ner fare is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strongest hit the road along the road .
J. Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already threat@@ ening .
not just him , but all the restaurants have it &apos; hard hit . &quot;
they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ a@@ eil .
we &apos;ll be glad to be glad for every euro .
the sales revenues amounted to more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road sl@@ ender have thrown his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to be released half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics could have been re@@ acted differently .
instead , government President JÃ¶rg Schmidt was on request by G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , having regard to the information , the restaurant has benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they even have the dis@@ advantages , which caused by the renovation .
G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something generous was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that its inn will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
other common guests are now able to understand more frequently due to the complicated traffic management even less frequently .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is pretty nice anyway .
in the end of the renovation work , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner has no doub@@ ts after the end of the renovation work .
despite the cris@@ es with BSE and bird flu , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction works to its clients for the largest crisis that its inn has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of work is already brutal there .
the terror campaign is continuously har@@ assed in the name of the terror campaign .
according to recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is now offering a th@@ icker security package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior on the introduction of his new security package .
they ur@@ ged you up .
other , further points would be discussed within the parties first .
I also involved myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of the Interior , it is situated on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ zi@@ Ã¨re takes a little time after his recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
but now the fall , however , fell so extensive .
a lot is already known , pro@@ claims that a new safety authority is to worry about the b@@ aked communication , is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications for flight passengers and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities comes as well as sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is launching a second race for proposals that have not been to do with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ y for terror@@ ists below penalty and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU man dre@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , it can still be done for reasonable and challenging even what has no chance at the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist partner .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in themselves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is planning a quick procedure for shi@@ fts and more ways to escape people in front of deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees that are brought specifically to the country are to leave their smart phones and account social media accounts for a security check .
with Dul@@ ings for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than date - about such that off@@ ences will go away or cast their papers in order to dev@@ ise their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally resistant .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
and in some points - at the un@@ equal treatment of thought , the question arises : what does that actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not obvious that the terrorist attacks of Ans@@ bach and WÃ¼rzburg refugees .
Moreover , many people in view of the high refugee numbers wor@@ ried about safety .
and things , who in@@ filtr@@ ate people , were now not cl@@ amped in election seasons .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the im@@ pur@@ ge is great .
and yes , there are turn@@ outs .
Union and SPD measures the subject of internal security increasingly in position .
in the past few days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ n@@ ful dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Unions of the Interior , in which the State leaders also require a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is concerned here to reconc@@ il@@ ate sounds too .
from a return from the double pass he is nothing .
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ pri@@ ck , be not sen@@ sible .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he concerns his constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional , and whether it is really &quot; done &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first be shown here .
it &apos;s a lot of things that could cause dispute .
however , the SPD also tries to pro@@ claim the topic of internal safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ ens@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once with careful meeting of talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything to help maintain security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming to come by .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als the delivery pay worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the call action there are vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen launches from the deliveries in the second half of 2015 .
Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ boat can continue to present an increase in the previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air due to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand VW mark@@ eted primarily in Western Europe and loaded with the sale of the company , like the company recorded in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent lower vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales rose 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by nearly a sixth place .
JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann , leader JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker numbers from July , mainly due to two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets , in some core markets , the change economic conditions has been given .
besides the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote disp@@ ers@@ ed from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the US , where the exhaust gas aff@@ or@@ ated first is es@@ cal@@ ated , there is also a decrease of Min@@ us .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony was further limited by diesel sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition deficit of 0.9 per cent is equivalent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales expansion from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls for some 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW stated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance does not show any deteri@@ oration .
the bus stop to the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed eg@@ ram &quot; certificate , but I didn &apos;t talk about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as was on Friday in the company on Friday .
reason or legal im@@ perfec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee on the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the past Monday .
from the Ministry of Culture , this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fully comply with the editions of my In@@ quiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; stated by the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has acquired the guarantee that reduces fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after upgrading no deteri@@ oration , and all the typical verification of vehicles will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers for example a half year after retro@@ fitting approximately with one engine damage to a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
it is also important to avoid the customer &apos;s customer , that there is nothing to do with the ab@@ ass@@ or@@ ab@@ al damage , which means nothing to do with the ab@@ ass@@ or@@ al guarantee , such as it was called .
therefore , for example , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is required by rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers that park 40 million euros on plaster or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single case and does not see the signal : normal savings would not have to be afraid to pay for their au@@ ster@@ ity pen@@ alties . &quot;
storage Ban@@ ks money above night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this charge requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ ap from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over â¬ 100.000 to gi@@ ro@@ - or day deposits .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been able to rise 40 million euros for some time , that could be withdrawn from one day to the others and cannot be able to understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me on the central bank account and also cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay 4000 Euros for every million Euros . &quot;
from now on , the costs will continue to give the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is simply dropped in the Tres@@ or@@ acle of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had already experienced four inst@@ ances , I did not play the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have their understanding and changed to other investment platforms .
just a few emig@@ rants to other banks .
the cooperative association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone bear alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working permanently not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased its fees for account , credit cards or transactions .
for deposits with deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Bank &apos;s Association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients need to pay for deposits , to do this , the competition in Germany is subject to banks and savings . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; a client@@ ele , who is endowed with some l@@ ush under management . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank account if they are free of charge .
established in 1911 , Co@@ operatives G@@ mund has offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ager , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative organization of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comp@@ lied on deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of June , the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich followed the end of June : &quot; the threshold of the neg@@ atives to go towards the private customers , is very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ us the emig@@ ration from An@@ alloy to the competition .

destination plates : who actually buy sil@@ es ?
lon@@ ely men of middle age love sheets .
before you have to divide the comment on it , in order to surprise him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ slip cases with har@@ rows , this statement now runs from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most common re@@ sign@@ ment of sound records came not to an boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that gre@@ et the re@@ alities of physical objects , but due to the Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a plate are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most un@@ likely buyer group .
it is also not hor@@ des by Hob@@ bies - it has a emotional significance : older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend some time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow an news report on TV would like to follow the camera , while I remain in am@@ id@@ st a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , before I stop , my hands hold and somewhat more immense of things like : &quot; so let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw at a glance .
even if the heart rises to So@@ H@@ os slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent S@@ eller are located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I &apos;d like to ask the camera , I would like to switch the camera for the next part in which I meet in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to under@@ estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I say of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours .
is he a collectors , and I ask ?
&quot; I guess &quot; I guess &quot; says he .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 boards .
these sound records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed after him ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available entry : it is now able to buy sheets when he had appeared and again buy articles that he had sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late &apos; 60s , early &apos; 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; says he .
he is true to those who buy the boards , rather giving , and glad@@ ly spend some time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who influenced by the Medi@@ en@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and will have happened to buy their old plates back .
concerning the talks , which I have led , people usually have taken care of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs will now sell their CDs to buy back their records . &quot;
this would explain the boom in a particular age of a particular age .
but what about the inn@@ ate emotional meaning of plates ?
it just takes some seconds in a shop as phon@@ ica to real@@ ise that record business provides a relaxing community of equ@@ ine inn@@ s .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the contact @-@ free payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of the b@@ aff@@ ing plate , from objects to call the happ@@ ier excursions .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of material ownership , as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people so .
it is a simple way to continue intellectual .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of a plate stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people purchased a board have not yet heard .
the survey also revealed that 41 % have a record players who never use them while 7 % of those who have a plate , no turn@@ tables .
at this point of the news report , I probably would look very wor@@ ried about , while I bl@@ amed a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ ile versions .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone only recently came here and said , &quot; I am sitting a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound top that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; says he .
this is not a big percentage but it will definitely happen .
more productive , less musi@@ kl@@ ast@@ y .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who only pur@@ ged slowly .
opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor has a b@@ lower audience , than I go .
there are couples about 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women &apos;s middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops is - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thesis and sex@@ es Pop instead of experimental Jazz goes from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in the customer .
none of them looks strange , but n@@ ag@@ ant psych@@ ic sad@@ ness are hard to be fixed when you see someone at someone for 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and consider the variation of the available plates for sale .
she rather makes a p@@ addle ste@@ aler as a big one .
they don &apos;t earn much , so the collecting of plates do not say real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a lovely pl@@ agues .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers : urban Out@@ back .
while I give the ticket to sample the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager cameras for a moment to purchase Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to hold them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction in these objects could mean more money for the industry , and some customers send in the depths of so@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like boards .
even though my research studies showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v will vote , at least in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collector in S@@ oh@@ o , who exist in reality , sheet shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums are not taken into account .
those people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ roll through Lake stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by sl@@ abs , while they fall short of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoul@@ ders of middle age .

French Court re@@ jects on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , settled .
at a venue this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops within the camp goods , of cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ ote , sell , hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few euro in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture are argu@@ ed that these places would be over@@ thrown because they would not be paid a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that &apos;s a fire and a risk of fire .
all humanitarian groups divided into court with that business and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups are not enough to offer enough food for growing numbers in the warehouse .
they also brought out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accomodation and free meals for people in need to offer .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 provisional shops , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely essential . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois M@@ olla said that the food business , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than only people who live &quot; in extremely pre@@ prec@@ ari@@ ous terms . &quot;
he said that the areas of tran@@ qui@@ l relations between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the re@@ mor@@ sel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; CafÃ© of the camp , which is commonly operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum for the hundreds of needy people , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition in order to maintain the Kids &apos;s CafÃ© .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; for that children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jung@@ le camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new sl@@ ender in the course of the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep the World Cup at a glance , that remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not allowed a statement for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me it &apos;s hon@@ est@@ ly difficult to comment the time from yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze rest in peace , which causes the reasons for Deb@@ ak@@ el .
at the time of the world championship in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to compete for the title .
&quot; I will look something exactly what we changed in the last time . &quot;
&quot; it also counts my position , &quot; writing the three @-@ day tim@@ eless world champion who lost at the 5@@ 5.5 km more than three minutes on the Olympic Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) .

Group increases in start @-@ up for live video trans@@ missions
other people playing video games is a huge success - that will also profit Microsoft .
this technology group purchases the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
how much money runs for the tak@@ eover , Microsoft announced not on Thursday .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can look at other when playing , but also access .
for example , they can give up the players missions and equi@@ p@@ ments equipment and equipment .
the Board of Ac@@ ti@@ vision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
Facebook Help on the way to global media experience .
the advertising industry is already listening .
employees of the start @-@ ups that has its seat until now in Seattle in Washington state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft headquarters in California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and chief Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
the customers should therefore change nothing by the tak@@ eover .
according to Microsoft in the video player , Be@@ am is integrated around the Xbox console .
the market of the live streaming of video games is presently growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ wit@@ ch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ wit@@ ch bought the online stock tra@@ der Amazon in 2014 - for almost one billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be effectively over@@ se@@ ded by the Tem@@ por@@ ters .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be applied to an accident in Wiesbaden , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , to fre@@ eway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with a @-@ time Tem@@ plate , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limit .
a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ately .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days when the case data is transmitted via a modem .
in addition to laser technology , all vehicles on multiple tracks can also be recorded simultaneously .
we can also monitor the variable speed lim@@ es as well as the transfer rate according to time , strips and vehicle class .
the tra@@ ilers can move to the manufacturer according to manufacturer using any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not easy to sound , it is lowered into the measuring mode , so that the wheels are dis@@ cr@@ ushed in the pan@@ ze@@ al and f@@ avo@@ red outside .
it is also possible to protect a built @-@ in alarm system from v@@ and@@ alism .
the trailer has been tested in various German countries since 2015 and has now also been used since 2015 .
also foreign authorities including new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ way ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class car@@ ts
the amazing performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop during the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio here with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji divided a masterpiece in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back of the back , liner and raw force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ aille every color .
the defeat was sunk by the non @-@ bad Tro@@ st@@ Prize of the Silver Medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the B@@ ok@@ s , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day may fall back on them in the final .
but in this form Fi@@ ji could be beaten in this form a 15 man team .
it might be a comfort for GB - but it probably is probably not - that at least a gold medal around his neck will hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief manager Ben R@@ yan , the former boss of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sn@@ ap will wake up , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it was feeling the captain of Tom Mitchell and co . on , when the World Series winners run 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au placed on the corner .
with another four minutes playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he walked .
it has hardly arrived 12 @-@ 0 and GB .
a pre@@ stige of Mitchell stopped off the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third goal but it only stopped Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner was a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning with the re @-@ catch and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou are prec@@ eded by a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gateway .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like it was Fi@@ ji who was born to play the 7 while GB still learn .
it is like that too .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ ag@@ ic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ season , until Joshua was going through Tu@@ is@@ ova following a Br@@ illi@@ ant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started a touch for GB , made a touch down in the left corner of a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favor of the South Atlantic , whose fans sw@@ apped and d@@ anced at the Tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i t@@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ Ã¶n@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is em@@ aged and GB are ro@@ uted and beaten up in the grass .
early on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa into a cris@@ p match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown presented the leg in the first half to the front but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive foot@@ rest and scored a gate to the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Teams , secured the win - thereby the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the train@@ ers to win the rowing ...
there will be no emotional gold when playing these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing boat to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve which enter into the history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it were only the ones sitting on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices im boat . the Echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in branch without tax wife in succession , the first women in the history of the British sports that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ are un@@ le@@ aded operation , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete , which slides over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each Gold at the Ru@@ dern there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to give hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no more helpful than the trainer , who would not know that he would survive this day at all , than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said that he ris@@ ky .
I had a bladder cancer that is operational and they did so .
if you do not do it , he sp@@ read@@ eth everywhere .
it would have been a pretty worse situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to begin the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , so that the inter@@ ruption for a minimum , if this could be the right term even under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was a incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it starts like this .
the rowing itself is a challenge , but this makes it even larger .
in the case of the victory there went their first thoughts to Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning to talk a little more than otherwise and trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also have worked Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would not have a massive Dan@@ ke to him . it is the best trainer in the world .
I wouldn &apos;t have a better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver to reserve a lot in reserves .
we were then imprisoned at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in trial , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of them .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something of the rab@@ ies .
we wanted to see today no fire@@ works , we wanted to win a good result , go out and win the race , what we did so .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions of the future .
since next week , Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer of Steve B@@ shall .
now I want to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ ton Group &quot; , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ Ã¶ller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian brand . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose tool used as a model for large water producers .
so , some time ago , it was written in a review by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia sp@@ ends the purposes .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ed group sailed &quot; Bavarian national as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband employee , was 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water group with seat in K@@ otten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with around 5500 inhabitants .

in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised G@@ Ã¶l@@ lers loy@@ al , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 .
he used himself with a lot of warmth for its water purpose and he has lived with the water @-@ purpose association as well as it would be his own company .

as a highlights from his point of view , he called the fountain and the restructuring of the purpose .
the most difficult challenge , and the difficult use , but the pipe quar@@ ry at the case of Kirch@@ ner is on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be observed once only because they filled the flood of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches .

steel - Light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky agent and energy intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional cost in million@@ aires .
financial loads caused by the industry from the eco @-@ cost promotion threatened , are the table .
in the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es Reg@@ ions , the German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission had originally planned to demand the gases from the high furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , to the bag .
according to the German industry , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , which is now a meeting point with the EU Commission for talks with the competition fer@@ oci@@ ous Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if generators be replaced with the steel units , an EEG conversion of 20 percent will be replaced .
but also this will not be exalted in the steel industry .
the IG Metall had welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on its own power production .
this means that the status Quo would be largely written to date .
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission standards are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by IG Metall @-@ Chef JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China , focused on the world &apos;s largest consumer demand in China , fell on the global market .
European producers t@@ oss Chinese steel con@@ ties price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has quite relaxed .
one hand @-@ educ@@ ated import duties on import duties , to the other have improved economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear how sustainable the prize money is .
the German industry primarily ge@@ aring Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp in the German industry in Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp .
last@@ ly , the prices finally stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector re@@ acts on the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to close the closure of individual works as well .
at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel producers remain careful despite increased prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons and six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the German unification of Germany took place on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the set went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production rose by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation in the next months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : sing pra@@ ys good
the singing has already accompanied her whole life : as a young woman she was in school choir , at the teaching position , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a senior citizen .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels great , che@@ er@@ ful and totally alive , says it .
and at the door of her health , they doing something good at the same time .
because singing is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and divide the joy of music with equ@@ ackl@@ es of music .
through the regular mer@@ ges , senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts .
for often social and family structures are often exposed , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in their choir : &quot; to arrange and to organize and learn to others - a choir is a very special form of the compositions . &quot;
can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ackl@@ es writes .
for they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly requests his lung , even in everyday life are not as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Urs@@ ula L@@ enz from the Swiss Con@@ sortium for the senior citizen .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher degree of power , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people are spar@@ ked many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people themselves escape their lying events in a long time .
in case of singing the head requires a special performance , says L@@ enz .
at the same time to concentrate on their own voice and at a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only practice themselves on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition , which rides through the singing in the choir , H@@ ackl@@ es writes .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing by the singing in the choir .
self : show yourself : if I do something for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - these experience strengthens .
so good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
if anyone wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent , will av@@ enge L@@ enz .
you sing not alone - at 50 sing people who hears it when once a sound goes up next to it ?
in search of the matching offer , Sen@@ ackl@@ es has different possibilities , says H@@ ackl@@ es .
someone s@@ ings from a head @-@ circle in a senior par@@ ench@@ ym@@ a , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer reviews of the choirs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right directly to the church or church .
many seniors will also find over the Internet .
if any one has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask help for the Internet .
those who desire to sing , shou@@ ldn &apos;t connect to a choir .
singing the soul good and has just a liberation - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a cat to yo@@ y of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , the effect of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys are on adult animals .
in her surprise , the males also didn &apos;t get cold - however , they kept the difference to the female always .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ous@@ y degree of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ th@@ ening of the little ones .
they react around ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of Kitt@@ ens , which have chosen in great trou@@ bles , as scientists have found out by the veter@@ inary Academy of Medical School and Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also respond to the p@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the ten@@ sions of less and heavily exhau@@ sted young for the males either do not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the beginning of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ das Biology &quot; magazine in this Friday .
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie distingu@@ ishes itself with the drums of their help needy .
a total of nine adult males and eight lim@@ bs were observed from the standard arm of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a small p@@ enny of little babies that were taken for three minutes from the or@@ f@@ box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
at the other hand , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ened cookies , which were also raised in addition .
the researchers make their results despite the low sample for sa@@ wing vig@@ or@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted strongly in the terror , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned up faster to the speakers , when this sh@@ outs played the very well @-@ known k@@ itt@@ ens .
this Sk@@ ill may be born or have the sexually mature with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males did not react , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already resear@@ ched the reactions of women and men on child@@ care .
also , some studies showed that women did sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky ri@@ zes with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ k@@ is is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ k@@ Ã¼r an arrest warrant .
he is accused of having become a member of the terrorist group .

it is not possible even before the football .
the Prosecutor dropped an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ k@@ Ã¼r .
this is therefore accused of having been living in the South of America , member of a terrorist group .
SÃ¼@@ k@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len must be responsible for the observer of the Pre@@ dig@@ o Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the initial condition is valid for 90 days , it is still valid until October , in fact , the life of most Turks , however , does not affect the life of most Turks .

bombing error in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
in Thailand , the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was standing in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶ll , in Friday .
they suffered strange wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again .
she planned her home travel at the beginning of September .
whether of the explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ ch , also an Austrian citizen is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in a consistent contact with local authorities , so be@@ aded .
in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in had first explo@@ ded two bombs in an excav@@ ated area .
according to the police , the police have been killed in Thailand and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch , and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again , two petrol sets went up again , a further human being killed according to the authorities .
also by Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explo@@ ded in the morning .
at Det@@ onation in the near of the popular bathing train Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a police station .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a urban workforce .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ si@@ ding principle went to air in the air before the Re@@ vier of the Coast Police .
after all the determin@@ ations of Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and at Ch@@ om@@ on at the south @-@ east coast had several injured .
it is related to explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was called Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks have the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ ic@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re assum@@ ing that they are a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early in order to express itself to possible moti@@ ves , but it is likely to take action by the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
the Thai media also wanted to recogn@@ ise a pattern in the attacks of the country , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police declared that the terrorist attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
instead it rather , that the bombs of the prev@@ ailing military j@@ unta were laid .
in the past few days , the authorities have kept confi@@ dential references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the South of the country - but they did not have been informed about the exact time and places .
still be un@@ clear that a group behind the attacks .
the police reported public officials to strengthen the security office buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge any tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace dating back to the years of Thailand , King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after all successful bombing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry for Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to make the instructions on the Thai Security Council as a result .
high security risk ( level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ c@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ on and its surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be some necessary journeys in these provinces .
high security risk ( level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution .
these spatial influences have also been in developing the military influence in the next few years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs be an attempt to raise chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had taken in 2014 after a phase bloody uph@@ e@@ aval , keeps himself up to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it has not been succeeded in developing the military , which has been in the utter@@ most south of the country for years , in the outer south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at a popular meeting point - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is advis@@ able to the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several actions , the constitu@@ ents of the Federation also have provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity &apos; Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ident@@ ity Against the Freedom Party &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ arten of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immig@@ rants or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in fighting extrem@@ ist mode .
that is why we observe the movement too .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it is turned against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ land . &quot;
constitu@@ tional@@ ity in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NRW , Saxony , Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ as said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority I have closely voted in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group , where she says , &quot; said the constitu@@ tional@@ ity .
generally , extreme extrem@@ ists , they are an@@ gled with adol@@ escent speech , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as right homosexu@@ als .
this is not any advertising for the own thing .
the prop@@ aganda should be emotional .
young people are due in particular ways .
that is dangerous .
last year , there had been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D policies .
Ma@@ arten said that he had not in@@ sights .
the constitutional protection of this type is relevant only from certain point .
it comes to whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , which changes in extrem@@ ist , changes and extrem@@ ist extrem@@ istic .
that is crucial if such people will have influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of high @-@ speaking pen@@ alties and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ arten , he would not speak in this context , nor of new right terrorism .
but we found it in recent years that it can be legally ster@@ ile structures .
there were &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that further legally @-@ terrorism groups or small groups formed the attack against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee &apos;s or attacks in other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves .
a German @-@ wide or European control of legal ror@@ ism may not be recogni@@ z@@ able .
previous groups were created on the regional level or social networks .
however , Ma@@ arten did not worry about that many survi@@ vor@@ s went to the account of people who did not occur in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ect for attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed perpet@@ rators , who had nothing to do with right @-@ wing @-@ wing , who perhaps were polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , which however did not have radic@@ alised with right @-@ wing laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te comes to the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; not always determine the olymp@@ ic or world records at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center of the slightly out@@ varied s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer allowed to see time in TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected .
Hab@@ its was subsequently transferred to the social networks for vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
it was rather his not just an athlet@@ ic figure that moved the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ up from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ lying countries .
since in Eth@@ opia , most athletes run , Hab@@ it wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ name took the round .
some media showed him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pro@@ sper@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny to him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Freestyle , there was no role played .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL , &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i run for media attention .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea were unforgettable when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 meters of Freestyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old met only eight months before the Olympia , and had never had a long distance before the competition .

accidents - bus sliding in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ au@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
when an accident of a travel agency with 43 senior citizens were injured as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ au@@ n ( Landkreis Aur@@ i ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the construction of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their informations according to a opposite direction .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped in a atro@@ cities like an speaking speaker of the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an ambul@@ ance came to an accident on the provincial road 2 .
the in@@ sights were brought back by a liner bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ au@@ dien@@ ne district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .

the charges per cubic metre of waste water will amount to 2,@@ 10 euros as of October 1 , 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
in case of the Az@@ endorf plant , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then be increased once again , when appropriate support measures will be necessary .
after a large calculation , the se@@ wage prize in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 Euro per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget of the budget was established by the Land@@ rat and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ages .
the market is oblig@@ ated to operate the plants in due to legal basis to operate the plants .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and the industrial enterprises from Wel@@ ech@@ es will have to take refuge in Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ uth , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Head of Herbert Schmidt on the board , a re @-@ cal@@ ulation of the fees for se@@ wage plants was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there will be also obes@@ ity and covers from previous calendar period .
the degree of serious activ@@ ating increases so that there are relatively small establishments with a very low water san@@ itation , which is between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
as a result , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be engraved .
in addition , wast@@ ew@@ ater is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calendar period , in all three plants were not least incur@@ red in a considerable extent due to their age and repair applications .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ cel@@ es , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , Lin@@ den@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ew@@ ater system , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the pump@@ ed plant pupp@@ et , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to over@@ taken care of the ground and had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation of the first pl@@ ough@@ s , the se@@ wage sl@@ ud@@ ge provides an additional ventil@@ ating option to keep the water@@ legal regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenditure , the continuing education and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were clearly below the current level of the previous year in 2011 / 2012 .
Stein@@ hÃ¤user clearly made its expend@@ itures for the operation and maintenance &quot; in the three plants . &quot;
in this manner , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in se@@ wer@@ age plants had been spar@@ ed spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain further , especially since you can not extend the supply area of the san@@ itation group Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to be extended by these systems because it concerns de@@ struc@@ tive .

you can transform itself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting by Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are in@@ con@@ fin@@ ed , independent tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ enium per day .
all bug@@ tr@@ l to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have withdrawn in the past criticism of the past , in which it was charged that the App Black@@ face convey@@ ors or white skin would act as beauty ideal .
when this week some us@@ ers hit a filter , which gave them tw@@ inkl@@ es , false teeth and recorded che@@ eks , some critics named a rac@@ ist cartoon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish . &quot;
they asked if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y had a larger problem to prevent the company with diversity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat , it would have had the feature de@@ activated .
the company offered a debt : the filter was an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but exter@@ n@@ ally , the rac@@ is@@ os@@ us experienced , remin@@ ded the filters of infr@@ ing@@ ing cl@@ ashes .
other contra@@ cted the An@@ ime comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose information became widely distributed over the photos , that the filter is inj@@ ected and was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter @-@ setting of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not le@@ ak @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ low@@ ish was removed .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that threatened these cultural proud dra@@ stically .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ eness and integration policy , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we are all in their hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - those in the race of race several than their older counter @-@ players - could more likely to expect to be eligible for Sen@@ si@@ vity .
if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult to show that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and ur@@ ged others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a telephone interview they said they believe that road @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y has a lack of di@@ vers@@ eness in Snap@@ chat with Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leaders , finishing her record with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ight Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either , they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their employees so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who are working there , but not in positions in which they &apos;re safe or feel as well as to say . &quot;
other parts your opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has dropped largely un@@ answered .
the company has not published any numbers for the sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , they refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently maintained a personnel responsible , focusing on population groups and on internal integ@@ rating environments .
Zh@@ u said that she is closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask me if they need more users such as us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership for@@ gery IS@@ IS Secret Services , outlines the Congress of Congress
at the United States Central Command , United States Central Command and changed our detailed information to describe an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can Commun@@ ism , declared by major dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Intelligence Agen@@ cies , reported how pre @-@ established its estim@@ ations regarding the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Service Information , which were typically picked up by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , were regularly allowed by the American efforts towards terrorism , as the actual states of other news services , &quot; quoted newspaper article published the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , &quot; &quot; &quot;
gui@@ ding error in Cent@@ Com is enough to reach the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct remarks that government peaks under Obama instructions given to change the reports , as an@@ alysts were subjected to the pressure of their pre @-@ laws , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l , too .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements prior to Congress were clearly positive than the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com Speci@@ alist was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Republi@@ can from Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the peak of Central Command offers the latest reports to run the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after which was added that an@@ alysts had become wor@@ ried about the man@@ ipulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday is completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com Reports by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
the National Services Committee published its own findings on Thursday , which accounts with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com developed an over@@ ly limited process for creating news coverage regarding I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi safety services , &quot; gave the highest prime dem@@ ok@@ rat , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of re@@ conn@@ aissance reports , &quot; ur@@ rec@@ ated the mor@@ ally under an@@ alysts and &apos; handed over little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave up no evidence to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts &apos; as regards a &quot; designated political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was released on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; on Tuesday .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon &apos;s general spec@@ trometer , based on complaints of Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , announced that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the convention during the investigation of the general spec@@ ulative report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts could definitely have di@@ verg@@ ating opinions concerning interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ations@@ over the question of successful air@@ campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that in the meantime is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , rejected the question of President Obama to the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of decl@@ ining information about the Islamic State was remin@@ is@@ cent of dis@@ agreements more than ten years ago , as Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written part of the recommendations of many an@@ alysts , and a little time on the wall to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led to Mr. Hoo@@ ker on indication of government agencies , that contrary to the government &apos;s government proposals , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because this provis@@ ionally refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field of hockey , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 seal over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember to have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place , which stay after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet next round in the last match of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two will get in each group of six teams in each of the first and second place .
the first @-@ place finish will lead to the strong Dutch , somewhat longer from the way that lead the other group .
as always the game can go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host of their success story , four years after the last London Games have landed on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania while she had a hockey ra@@ cket in their hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became the national champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 when it was unable to qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team passed away everything .
in the subsequent year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus began to make things better .
&quot; a cultural change , an incre@@ mental change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the job @-@ job in London , which we have now .
we can rip off the ru@@ in .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed un@@ tough and kept the playing time from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter till B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it carried out a Sprint with the flat ball about the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ beat the ball in the gate to pro@@ cure the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez was the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the goal of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to make a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
like b@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the heart of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are too late as it is too late for the Olympic Games too .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and un@@ trained , a rapid relay for competition and stre@@ w@@ ns .
it is like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is provided by the wrist@@ watch to the Turner at the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to TV , a newspaper read or listen to your neigh@@ bors in the waiting long in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ut@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are log@@ an do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples , could have definitely be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ ancy .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not lit any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow , the sports that are not generally acknowledged : air guns , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest , and may reign for long .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me get the attention of the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines had already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was anno@@ ying that many of whom I had asked , did not know that it is at all .
this could also be regional Ig@@ il@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes competing for competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are invited to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian , to divide the women to the women .
Dong Dong in China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ines ski@@ p a certain exterior char@@ me , in part because it sounds for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ ard that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never too excited calls - but also the Gra@@ z@@ ie of the Turn@@ ens and Di@@ ves that combines two sports .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish @-@ bo@@ under @-@ trampoline , which means a lot like &quot; jumps . &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , h@@ real and salad ) before they landing at the feet .
they are evaluated according to the official programme , difficulty , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
officers from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
medal hop@@ ing must go beyond gold for gold , faster , upward , and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , to the top and down@@ wards on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast , another one @-@ known objective : the world or Olympic champion .
the goal oriented stre@@ b is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer .
but it &apos;s the thing that I own even while watching these games as a little effort .
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she super@@ vised , seem@@ ingly heavy he@@ avi@@ os like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , go down , then down , then back up again .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final round of the women will be held in Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to see in general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness of consciousness can only be reached by the attack@@ ing and the object of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air round off to the air in the morning .
&quot; a generation protest &quot; in Ethiopia , Long to become part of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting at the government &apos;s resistance .
witnesses say that eigh@@ ty protest@@ ing during cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia straight together now ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid construction of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government afflicted the country and far more territories .
last week , thousands of people hit the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was un@@ bar@@ red according to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen had shot down armed protest@@ ers and killed .
in the movement , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety merchants young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to assemble this country and yet it will even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence service collabor@@ ates closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
C@@ ush &apos;s economy grew in a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted to silence what dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or put into the wake of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you under@@ press people and these no other options have nothing to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m T@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation Protestant .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the soil to the wor@@ shipping in terms of power of the reg@@ ained coalition .
after a further critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and therefore control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the st@@ resses go along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line , in June hundreds of lives .
Analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who in the last years more or less than were forced to eng@@ age , and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years of survival have now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the past few years , many Ethiop@@ ian workers were able to communicate through the social media because cheaper smartphones and more frequently were improved and improved by Internet services .
even if the government shut access to Facebook and Twitter , whatever they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still communicate over the Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that they keep up .
several young Ethiop@@ ian showed that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest Eth@@ nic in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since Equ@@ ations pro@@ sper@@ ated the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia , predominantly of Christian bre@@ aches , in the politics and the economy , while the Oro@@ mos took off , of which many Muslims are living and live in Flach@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are involved in coordination with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests were in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is domin@@ ating un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , in the secret services , politics and politics .
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
in 2012 , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ claim leader , was forced to death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years , with Ethiopia , prime minister .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that it was particularly compens@@ ated in that , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special assigned to work opponents and to make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this basic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians , Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ significant reasons to take the status of Mr Mel@@ es .
An@@ other as Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , is Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South .
analy@@ tics say that he did not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ers controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had one such ri@@ ots had experienced in 2005 after thousands against elections , according to the information of analy@@ tics , the government failed and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many protest@@ ers were killed , even though there were less than in the last months , and that period of distur@@ ban@@ ces were relatively spe@@ eded .
based on Ethiopia , Ethiopia , leaders for their visionary infrastructure plan , as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this has not been the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ n@@ ical form .
last month a protest in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , headed by Tig@@ ray , and the hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray is always experienced in the social media .
analy@@ tics say that the protests inher@@ ited the United States and other Western allies into a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently ha@@ sted that it was closed on the basis .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to assemble its ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama ( IS@@ IS ) was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m &quot; was founded .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y , who turns his campaign by repe@@ ating his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; fo@@ unders &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions on the communications between the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clear and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ soldier , who ende@@ av@@ our to take him in an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain away statements , which he could not say .
after he had made the clari@@ fication on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the asser@@ tion of Thursday and existed in interviews , that he really had not inten@@ tional , the president and Mrs. Clinton used IS@@ IS .
but in a early morning in Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply sto@@ cky .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump has said in a series of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ations entirely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to sm@@ ash the testimony by saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate would not know about it .
the last storm of criticism is down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign for fail@@ ing effects on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held words for economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject .
on Twitter , it war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ os would result in force to higher taxes , and that he was bor@@ ing out of their speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken her defense to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved to himself when he meant that the Russians should make Mrs. Clin@@ t Ema@@ ils , but he later declared &quot; Natural , &quot; I said the sar@@ ist . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the spe@@ ech@@ es borders in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages of his fans are taken , as they arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who are observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe it is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements enough to be interpreted so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received a still prot@@ ector , because his conversion has gone continued .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the Federal States North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to exc@@ use his pro@@ voc@@ alist appearance , he charged his critics frequently to understand his testimonies or his hum@@ or false .
but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his loy@@ al co @-@ stri@@ des brought into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ ok@@ ant would like to be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent inter@@ c@@ ists , was to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said that he was inter@@ ro@@ gated by Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama named IS@@ IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ b@@ Ã¤n@@ kler , entirely wrong and therefore it happened because he left the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to ar@@ gue that the government had served as an outdoor minist@@ Minister to spread it to IS@@ IS , to spread out the situation in the Middle East , under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued its attacks on the media and threw their attacks against them on each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats don@@ ates to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use only one more proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .

after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ ained power to old customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through William@@ sburg from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , there was a while the coffee he@@ ap appeared , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was right on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , who liked it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drinks a coffee , even if they set the same day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time and loy@@ al customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and he ordered the same as the same .
&quot; I got a quarter after seven , every day as a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he would have wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal has still his usual order , but sometimes , he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , eggs and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t give his anger about it , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the propriet@@ or of the So@@ ap ch@@ ery , a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the caf@@ Ã©s as ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
the cafÃ© is also accepted by the traditional , Polish and Green@@ point .
a new customer has translated the menu to Poland and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to provide them soon , so that his new neighbours will be welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance to expand the cafÃ© at a neighboring building .
for many customers there is a new Ver@@ b to get their old favorites help .
Joseph W@@ itt was a certificate and said that it was destroyed on the ground , when the cafÃ© was closed .
when the new cafÃ© opened , Wh@@ itt said that the loc@@ als of the loc@@ als and the Order felt a new coffee machine as a return home .

the de@@ pri@@ ming meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , just after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt was a F@@ ai@@ ble for elabor@@ ate delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue , like P@@ Ã¢@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water &apos;s tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pr@@ au@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the elderly people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was published by the Chinese cuisine in the USA during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building in Lower East Side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; An an independent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they presented culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop . together with a repor@@ ter at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
bricks , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive trees while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables eat .
when the repor@@ ter ordered min@@ ced , this was appropriate for a discussion about the meal in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from a ingredient , and some cheaper , which stretches out the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have put on the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of Women boiling for male field workers and fresh b@@ aked past@@ el served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
they were the Americans that sent food to an hung@@ red Europeans during the first World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the way to which the country went so to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when the Americans was a central , donated theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ te was the same model : mysterious dishes such as bread and cass@@ ettes into stap@@ le food , the c@@ asserole dish as &quot; wonderful kind , essence re@@ lics recovered , &quot; noted bricks , since coo@@ ks could hide unt@@ ou@@ bt@@ ful ingredients under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry matter .
meat , for years the centre of the American cuisine was , became a rarely ser@@ vi@@ able luxury .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally mixed mixtures were tried to test as a low @-@ cal@@ ori@@ ous and nutr@@ itious satisfaction in front of taste or even healthy household stuff .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , a court prepared a court of this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no more popular on noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
butter and b@@ aked onions don &apos;t match each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
like never before or ever since , the bud@@ get@@ ary management - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the essence of the country .
by pressing the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ ages women to become &quot; budget spi@@ ders &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals , just to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic d@@ ain@@ ties .
in particular , reports on the answer of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ded L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude .
while he praised the simple I@@ owa farm house of his kitchen , he has grown like the billi@@ on@@ ely man of world to whom he has become .
&quot; he mo@@ cked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded meal @-@ room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful real@@ ise .
President Roosevelt might have had the same error if not his wife &apos;s Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to equi@@ p his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the an@@ cho@@ res of a house@@ keeper with no interest in taste compounds conducted by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House produced the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also prepared one of the most controversi@@ al food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected when the country came back onto the legs .
during our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair gave better understood by writing the ess@@ hab@@ its of brick @-@ in @-@ law in law - for example , how they could not dis@@ card food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really got sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a storm of rain .
after the plate at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were evacu@@ ated , they pulled down a dessert which she had prepared at home : the pr@@ au@@ car@@ ess , which he ate Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick that was to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone turned somewhat le@@ ased a spo@@ ons in the nar@@ rator , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .

in Bom@@ b Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he appointed his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the lives of their lives .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a fac@@ ial attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil group that has so far saved the lives of nearly 60,000 humans .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life into the game to pull people out of their bom@@ bed houses and to aff@@ ord the first aid of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue plan of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the g@@ lowing symbol in the thro@@ at of war .
but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die for my life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar itself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ oc@@ op@@ ters have been dis@@ car@@ ded over the Alz@@ ette district , which was filled with chlor@@ inated gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the remains of the bomb , that no children are playing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bombs of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship &apos;s research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland was only sold after 150 years of yo@@ ungst@@ ers .
on the ground of the northern Atlantic coast , in an hour he comes in an hour an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes up , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and is almost as fast as a Rob@@ be with this top speed .
that was characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , but seems to be a cylinder position for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any point of Greenland , which could be 392 years of age .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock , which means that this life expectancy for verteb@@ rates a world record .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long that Greenland will be st@@ aging .
only the evidence was .
Greenland ha@@ w@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer the water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they dive in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s Greenland lifestyle .
her time l@@ up@@ un@@ emp@@ o lim@@ bs them when they took six animals with a transmitter .
they nevertheless make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had ar@@ ous@@ ed the jaw of a young iron .
maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver , that sw@@ ings out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , Fis@@ her@@ men , between 2010 and 2013 , in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 is cm size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already built before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic tests are larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centi@@ metres in length , the lens @-@ core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 due to nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland hair@@ y had normal Carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was actually shown for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metres of Greenland , an age of 335 years , while the record of Hai with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ birds only grew after @-@ up , when they are longer than four metres , was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age .
as one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be reached on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries .
and this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in iron waters , is no co@@ incidence .
even the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on pointed tip , was caught on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organ@@ ism from there live animals living on savings banks .
they turn later - and al@@ igh@@ ters slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to which the animal is swal@@ low .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on how many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; says the Evol@@ u@@ tion@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life .
construction in double pack
with themes around building , the community at the youngest meeting is mainly explo@@ ited .
with a relief , the committee took a Communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently given residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the land of land , par@@ cel@@ or@@ atory and re@@ mot@@ ions could be clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on measurement , the sale of plots in residential areas &quot; Street &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶n@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area binder 1 ) could not be interested in interest .

as it was said , building content can be obtained from now on the City Hall , over the awarding of the plots to the Municipal Council is expected to advise in its September meeting .
in order to en@@ vis@@ ing further industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided to change the ground plan for the newly created land area in the spring of this year .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main was therefore competing in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the best chances to put out work@@ places and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder , head of the Compet@@ ence environment Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is impossible to allow money to operate from financial transactions within the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass the approval in Britain is far enough .
that only use major US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs , jobs .
lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; will be bil@@ led with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Management ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have completed its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the sheet bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder .
indeed , Luxembourg houses a large fund sector , cutting edge , as well as Dublin and infrastructure .
Frankfurt am significantly easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
furthermore the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it wasn &apos;t easy to find free high @-@ quality offices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rental prices for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer the city stand at No. 7 in Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ference is : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt may attract other banks and investors . &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it vote .
for this even the forces involved : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead will receive legal costs of the hepatitis C Patent with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counter@@ act decided that Gilead @-@ based Technologies Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs that it was created from the H@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the federal government
Hill@@ ary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 , this resulted for the presidential election of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the presidential elections .
in 2015 , Clin@@ ique USD 1 million donated to charity projects , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in spe@@ ech@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister , issued a income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , released his tax exemp@@ tions from the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .

in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind the incorrect expres@@ sions and return to his previous promises to publish his instrum@@ entation .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax inspection through the tax authorities as the reason for its ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s elec@@ toral fight in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential election of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Thursday , she spoke the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what has committed any other presidential candidate over the past decades and his tax returns to publish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump had not been paid during the 1990s for two years , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Federal Government has become one topic in election campaign .
Clinton supports a control which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that would ensure people who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka required buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat to exchange a meeting on their tax returns .

Jewish Director at Berliner Hotel in Berlin , since Israeli pres@@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation to Berlin - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots compiled a media watch , having betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , where there had been no Israeli election in Berlin since the Arab guests had requested a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ en@@ entation &quot; Shoah &quot; sent his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list box list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s capital , elim@@ in@@ ates that Israel eliminated and eliminated ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a possibility to select Israel via an own call center .
based on an explanation , the director returned to the hotel reception area .
the answer , which he received , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; like Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel set out that the measure had a clear decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , le@@ aded the director even more rage .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix was cleared , &quot; the staff of Lanz@@ mann quotes .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ wo @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and was over@@ thrown .
that is really highly ac@@ em@@ ailed .
the fact that this is allocated in Germany in exactly these hotel chain is even a larger dis@@ grace .
the need no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people knew the whole a sc@@ and@@ al .
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been a con@@ sign@@ age of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ aming to you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was noted in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is situated on the no@@ bles Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all the alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ an &quot; for Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror .
&quot; there was never a direct directive &quot; to record Israel in the quick list box , &quot; quoted from the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds to the country code now added .
police Sets Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ raine against Protestant students of Brazilian students
students drove on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police together when they were gathered to demonstrate against the re@@ forms of the government for public education system .
the police put Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ a and Gum@@ mig@@ uel to the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began , as police officers attempted to inter@@ sec@@ t the students , which led to the police , rubber handles and dr@@ um@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their taxation of the plans .
according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300.000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the protest@@ ers saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er of walls .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
with the repe@@ al of the sanctions imposed by the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , who grew up by 7@@ 0.9 percent between Moscow and Teheran in the year @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions were abolished in Iran , the interest in pages of Russian companies increased heavily in the country , the ambassador .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to have access to the market .
of course , the further trading expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran remained in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade swing was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Irish tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , the Russian foreign companies represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as well as the tourist settlement in Russia .
you could say that the record figures will be broken in Russia from last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ ds to Pfor@@ z@@ iness of Charity
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch &apos;s Church were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were handled .
around the time until the next Rom@@ antic voyage of all ministers in the past two years , the upper chamber of St. Anna decided to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different Pil@@ gri@@ mage was examined and they finally decided for the Bish@@ ops of Fri@@ bourg , where in this year the anniversary of Mer@@ cy was rendered with an opened gate of the Freiburg Mu@@ enster , a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Car@@ lo@@ oms spread themselves on the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration of St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ ots and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point in Vill@@ ingen , where a MÃ¼nster &apos;s wife is also born and so the pilgrimage of MÃ¼nster was driven out of MÃ¼nster .
the individual day tours were shot in the morning and in the evening by a short im@@ pulse with different prayers , songs and fonts .
but on the way , the Min@@ is went on field@@ gun , chap@@ els or churches and again to sing together a song from the pilgrims to sing together .
for the nights there were a parish church on the local parish .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller also served for a tasty work as well as the evening meal and breakfast .
on the second day there went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to GÃ¼@@ ten@@ bach .
tags on the stage went to St. Peter , who had the exhau@@ sting distance , had to be dropped at the same time , at first , at first , approximately 500 altitude metres and then resum@@ ed .
the rewarded reward was a common gr@@ illing at the evening on the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing convent church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage of Freiburg .
in the late afternoon , the Min@@ is met in the afternoon at the Freiburg Mu@@ enster and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small im@@ pulse , God was ab@@ dic@@ ated here .
Min@@ is was greeted by Ko@@ h Markus O@@ bert in the evening Mass in MÃ¼nster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims could see the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar .
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon it went back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong congreg@@ ational experience were left .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms into the house when Br@@ ite Gold caught for cycling opportunities
the Scottish team in Rio to fame , in Scotland , Call@@ eman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner on the last night in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , in Rio to boast , as the British team ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow increased the anchor of Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who broke his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the j@@ acks and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to home a win of the favorites new Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick , after it takes just a modest sixth place in March , despite the Ho@@ ys World Championships in London .
the problem of Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ ring a gap created by K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the sc@@ ots that now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ ts , Kenn@@ y - the winner four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic champion , but won the New Zealand round the New Zealand for the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , barely returned , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and the Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a great part of transformation , in the execution in a higher gear in order to slow him to slow down and to keep it and above all scor@@ ners to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a dirty comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
in the final round , we mounted an Olympic champion and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there are no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave a weak start to the rail after a weak start .
he moved this statement later and there was no depos@@ iting of England Ri@@ vals .
for such a superior victory there was no problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels complete with all the GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined the last three months as a team .
we &apos;re in such a lot of world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London .
if that a barometer of our progress has been in the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated the win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve R@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese made by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat , to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two gold medals , he should be defeated to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there was a good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dy W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ner Dou@@ ill quali@@ fier with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 on the target .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest , where the Lon@@ gri@@ dge is foc@@ uss@@ ed on security .
he fought yesterday with applic@@ ants in front of the qualification , when they had called the officials to be called to measure his height .
in the respective women competition , which continued until tomorrow and finished , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team will rely on his powerful railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a band to medals .
based on a truly extraordinary representation of absolute Domin@@ anz in Beijing and London the expectations were run@@ off for Rio .
we played a drama in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex and fashion designs as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
but if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks much later than the legendary name GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of work - are on the game since the plant operators are termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , so that all delivery contracts opened , as the remote energy company will over@@ took .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to use the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 work stations in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Port@@ land are on the game .
no fewer than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of a closure .
in addition , it could happen to Domin@@ ic effects , since the sm@@ el@@ ter consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point of Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Port@@ land loses weight and ris@@ ed a closing time .
this stage follows the lon@@ gl@@ ass@@ y spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price of the plant .
AG@@ L that the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ ance with his Lo@@ y Yang A Power Plant in Lat@@ robe Valley distributed that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p represent smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to run , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting , &quot; the company divided by .
AG@@ L will continue to be the so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; that should have been in force since November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts for the financial year 17 may contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong sales markets for large retail prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of contracts in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; Exp@@ enses of a Termin@@ ation &quot; .
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; Ability to operate Al@@ co@@ as ... or ensure the power supply to the melting , &quot; not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that it had finished a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have been in force by November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has been re@@ signed by the contract .
analy@@ tics of the industry in front of the possible storage conditions in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements from the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ awatt hours of electricity every year .
if both plants disappear from the market , would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth subsidiary of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ade Cl@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ al issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York arrived on Thursday , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers was followed by a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ lo@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family and producers of Ke@@ eping up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she finished the cover of her sister and ends with a classic return : they all have a surprise work .
this is the cl@@ ish@@ ee@@ ated hands for almost any birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ claim brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to be able to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Car@@ path@@ hi@@ an began with safety .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue Cover is going to be beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September edition is for Vog@@ ue the most advanced edition of the year .
with a circumference , rather similar to a photo tape when a fashion magazine resem@@ bles a large number of advertising labels ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista used by the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 615 @-@ page advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ stum@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive , that in the past two years , the magazine appeared before the official announcement in front of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were definitely more &quot; celebr@@ ities , that &quot; as &quot; models that are famous are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ ani and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ acher J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga the honour had honor .
but even with the minor chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break model &quot; of its generation - below the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to fam@@ ed persons or reality Stars or yo@@ ungst@@ ers today , who know how to shoot a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is in@@ advert@@ ised ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career in Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to each other .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always an@@ gled in the fashion world .
in June critic@@ ized Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings of sal@@ ted boiling again when the news came with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but at the mis@@ sil@@ ut seemed to be pre@@ vent@@ ured at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is the true sense of the word a super@@ structure .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your plan of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell you on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
you are sold by her noticed pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds subsidiary to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time it is visible to the reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
annually , municipal districts have 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 votes from the country are exp@@ elled by the local government annually , while the industry accounts for the effects of other middle @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly elderly people , immig@@ rants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar products - are rejected on free legal services and legal services .
legal services to the municipality , which are already rented out , are ready for further cuts .
starting in June of the next year , these legal centres will lose a further 30 percent of its Federal agents .
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal Cent@@ res showed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Municipal Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically unified , which means thousands of people of major services that you need to be dismissed , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and afflicted debt , families that were dismissed by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have trouble @-@ specific species and this survey shows that they could not get the help you need .
the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of hil@@ s@@ needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems without any assistance .
we call for the Federal Minister of Justice and Federal Minister of the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , so that people who need help to maintain them with legal problems .
in the last year the state government had to raise funds for legal aids to national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the city centres and their customer community , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

while the red @-@ black government coalition , which could further reign in the north , it is not possible after the reconstruction industry in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have so good chances to continue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in Time l@@ upe : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the success@@ ors now domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a lot and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather t@@ apping .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight meg@@ abytes , which would now be enough for about two suit@@ ability with high resolution .
an iPhone is now available with a minimum of 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator , &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the stores and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros you can buy the devices even on the internet , but they &apos;re somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; Office in the West African format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax , the Communic@@ ator could be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , if too slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then there were a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was rather pro@@ ud@@ ly : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015 .
nobody could do in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything is different since .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled at Microsoft .
the market today rule over the market , which came to all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s today for a lot of people everyday .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion units have been sold , by Samsung and Apple alone , alone , 555 million units .
the global turnover of the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ current business provider of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ation accounts are coming .
around the Smartphone , all of the industry has grown .
the decisive breakthrough towards the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs in the Mac world began introducing the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet wireless , easy to use by touch screen .
the winner of Apple started today , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market .
finally , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has finally fighting .
the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ understanding of 20 years after the invention .
on average , every German today sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to push the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only to bring in our local commun@@ es and in the whole of London , but in the whole country , renew@@ ing pro@@ sper@@ ity and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , this is the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as we were in London in 2012 when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come again by creating new possibilities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices , some 40,000 new jobs and a youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and we will be able to bl@@ am@@ aze us at the world stage .
the bi@@ fl@@ es were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to survive , but He@@ ath@@ row answers to any questions asked .
like the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , Â£ 211 billion at wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in quite GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has earned a Â£ 11 billion valuable infrastructure programme in time and budget , from the T5 - which was elected five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies test drives of the world .
now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row as well as to ensure future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; Cat and mouse game &quot; regarding display block
for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block@@ ades , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ play . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the ad block@@ ades on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ od@@ al , in which user could upgrade their filters in the program to block rest@@ art@@ ing advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook has announced that his desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising , to identify which is the advertisement that is part of advertising is to be avoided .
but Ad@@ block told that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ od@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the show @-@ loos@@ ening Open Source Community and the modifications have already been possible since the invention of sco@@ ot@@ ting players in the g@@ ange , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media in the fight is a powerful indi@@ z for the industry .
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are lo@@ cur@@ ated , nearly four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users active on Facebook , which access their mobile devices to Facebook , makes Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the accounts recei@@ v@@ ables .
the company has optimized for display windows on desktop computers because mobile ad block does not have any effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , the spokes@@ person .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient great share of income so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile to be worthwhile as worth reading .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be &quot; ad &quot; in@@ ference tool &quot; to upgrade to people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just sends new filters to block it , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user does not constitute a positive experience , we are planning to address the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ person for Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b average , which is why we have concentrated on the development tools such as ad pre@@ ferences to lay more control into the hands of the people .
woman with thought suicide on Swiss motorway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witness , after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday arrived in a thought suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 close to Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman put in the Dun@@ kl@@ es &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; at the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , was wanted to kill themselves .
she died before the place .
several drivers have already been picked , but some have not been identified , the police said these as well as every voucher of the incident to report themselves .
it opened an investigation into an investigation , which is a logical step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something what the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases have been shown in the last five years that the drivers are not withdrawn into responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ es on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to go out in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of the cas@@ ual killing , after having left a man and had killed one night at the A1 in the near of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and was un@@ conscious in the streets , took the court .
the Court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- which had responded to a emergency call -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; entirely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Judge .
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should noti@@ fies the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Change : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past the Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with their hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could have been recorded out similar conditions .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their tight atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , similar atmosphere , and still slowly move slowly .
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet , probably accounted for more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to cover life and protect themselves before faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Models simulation , the slow rotation of Venus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Venus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained for almost two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produced rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that works like a rain@@ bow to sc@@ ute the surface from a large majority of the sun heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously suspected of planet surveys .
even though they were probably hab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years , --@@ encour@@ ages heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans are evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect - the Venus , who like we know them today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus Climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy come back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back to Colorado on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado River and led to a certain extent to the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years , I have been managing my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , Colorado River , with energy , passion and authenti@@ city , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy op@@ ted in a position .
I have thought in the course of the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth and to give it a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be matched to the organization .
he must also have a determination in all decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had been tax@@ ed on 23 May 2013 , op@@ pressed with him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Z@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy , during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 , he won the best coach of the league during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the association at 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild spot in the Western Conference around five points .
when Hall of Fame was won by Roy four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ Ã¶@@ Declaration join talks , set a strike out of
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers are exposed to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while all disp@@ utes set up at the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group performed spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to begin the process of current streaming process , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks , starting the next next year to rest@@ rain the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , protest against possible wage sub@@ missions of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has reduced rates to its counter@@ f@@ ishers in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent decline to on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to come across the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for his part of thousands of people and plans , to spend his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries since its activities were rati@@ onal@@ ised as a result of his mega @-@ expansion BG Group .
energy companies are subject to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that caused by the ruling of the British in June to rein@@ force the European Union .
in the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament Dave Anderson met this week with workers &quot; leaders in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we will need a business that works for many , not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rotation speed of stars in the star@@ z@@ ap of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest Mission with the Kepler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers helped to gather the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star@@ ing Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star@@ ry loops in different inst@@ al@@ ments as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods of planets are standing .
&quot; we hope that we experienced by the same one of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , to the age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ z@@ ap of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation originated approximately 125 million years ago now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you now turn right now .
at top rotating gu@@ esses , these m@@ stri@@ ches meet large amounts of star@@ ches .
because this winch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rot@@ ational speed begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every day by recogni@@ zing the time between the release of an recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- like s@@ ooth@@ ills -- .
the latest catalogue of rotary rates indicates that massive star more than less massive floors than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ ei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors to be more massive , while against faster rot@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ voy of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal laboratory to compare primary qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ z@@ ap of Pl@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
it &apos;s still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , when , when and why stars their rotation rates will slow down their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades which soon will be published in the astronom@@ ical journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball star turn off
tears ran to Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
following his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional winner will be on 12th August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the trial of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ship .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star game participants of Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ an .
his signature among a tenth year @-@ year contract granted him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast on December 31 , 2017 , he served as an advisor and youth coach - with a full content .
as a player paid Rodri@@ guez worth a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas rank@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to run some mil@@ estones .
the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two other bas@@ eball player found in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old has not yet been recorded in the glory hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ ar .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - Spitz@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al his appearance is outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star presented the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 ster@@ oids have been taken into existence .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main susp@@ ect for years to have an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida high @-@ performance funding .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I played a break of 20 years without break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its f@@ arewell day will not fail sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball alloys in their last games have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job includes no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Du@@ c@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the ratios with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson has been said to be sympath@@ y with the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ val@@ en Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want to use a @-@ Rod with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping cases
caught : due to a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , Wei@@ ght@@ lifting Adrian has not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are transfer@@ ed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
an athl@@ ete athl@@ ete should have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ falls the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro were known .
the Chinese swimming pool Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter ste@@ ep@@ le ch@@ ie@@ fly in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish poems became positi@@ vely tested in Brazil - immediately before the start of the athlet@@ ic light athlet@@ ics cont@@ ests come this news on time .
in Ch@@ en it had been demonstrated last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de that is used as a m@@ asked means for D@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ section .
the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their expul@@ sion by the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only ten seconds missed it the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to attend the prec@@ urs@@ ing over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; we will co@@ operate with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history is the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ itation of sports@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio abandoned the news about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was innocent , &quot; the only statement could be food supplements , &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics .
according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance around blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporary suspended , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial is supposed to have been positive .
by Bulg@@ arians , Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow registered with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right loop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , for example , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ load@@ able nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier than the an@@ ab@@ oli@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both compete for in@@ gest@@ ion , but may not launch in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association introduced the entire Russian team until except for systematic D@@ op@@ ings the start , too , too , produces many bad news in Rio .
in the swim sports , the former insur@@ ances in China had ensured even more violent disp@@ utes between athletes .
thus Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ ed@@ t touched the Chinese Olympic Sun Y@@ y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ ed@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was in the centre of a con@@ front@@ ation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping control , &quot; said this .
sun was positi@@ vely tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker her rans@@ om
programmer by erotic malware . currently , targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of malware @-@ def@@ ences , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , United Kingdom and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of a attack with comp@@ ress@@ er software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already generating a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware path@@ way .
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rator drawn by the perpet@@ rators , in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their ex@@ pressing software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential feed money is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching quick evolution of the malware software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the col@@ oring programs have been designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the perpet@@ rator software for themselves .
only private use were the aim , but the change to company att@@ els were out@@ stretched in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once in the computer of a victim , it seeks specifically for un@@ long changing files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
then the software will present the requirements of the comp@@ ress@@ er .
to get the final key code to the files , the victim need money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ne Bit@@ coin .
however , where with private use the personal photo database on the game is , it works for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the loss falls off when a cen@@ time is added .
22 percent of the affected German firms registered sales loss by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business activities completely , in case of a case .
in Germany , several hospitals already were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of acute disease .
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you can only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to re@@ ject the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators , in view of stand@@ still .
the chi@@ pper turn to know and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety for@@ gers of F @-@ Secure explo@@ res the user surface and get to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free @-@ to @-@ accessible support sites or un@@ dec@@ ryp@@ t for example files .
and private people after payments of a few hundred Euros will have to pay companies part hard negoti@@ ation and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ dec@@ ryp@@ t .
given the potentially high and relatively risk winn@@ ings from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware Er@@ press@@ ation , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains safety sex@@ es Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the antivirus vend@@ or SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write an om@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely it is that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their cont@@ ing@@ software then in the form of a software building box to the actual press operators .
the existing malware kits were created by providing malware , advise and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; delivery includes an adap@@ table tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the comp@@ ress@@ ors are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to distribute the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
you can log into one of the for@@ ums in the underground , buy the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per registered computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crimin@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ iny with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data .
over 50 percent of the IT @-@ IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte @-@ survey rely on to retri@@ eve R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scan software .
the perpet@@ rators have already been pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient thre@@ ats for successful path@@ ology more , thre@@ aten the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as some customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential of any kind of data even so much higher than before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things .
the Security Conference Def@@ con demonstrate security for@@ gers as they were able to receive control with the Internet linked thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the sec@@ tioning of a kind of block@@ aded system could definitely be a rans@@ om value .
if the perpet@@ rators have then to block a factory in a factory instead of heating in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a topic of Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and flexible working
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to put everything : a little SUV , a little CoupÃ© and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty re@@ load , but the HR V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually flexible in everyday life as a deci@@ de@@ dly flexible .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , and there &apos;s no place close to any place .
the materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortably , only the cockpit of the inside falls off there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
it is not only a trunk trunk of 453 l at the same time and 10@@ 26 l under hing@@ ed back @-@ backs , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bench can be valves and provide the storage space that is high from the floor to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space is slightly loaded , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to teach his work somewhat more quiet .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine of engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
it is set to be a bit direct .
the equipment available in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; is nothing to be desired .
the City emergency braking system is part of the security systems ( operates till temp@@ o 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the micro@@ set@@ ti@@ an assistant .
sometimes , the coll@@ isions were sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes because he has been rated as &quot; wander@@ ing objects . &quot;
very reliable , the remote control system works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respond to traffic sign recognition and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI connector located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ equipped gasoline @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much will the petrol engine will get from 20000 Euro , the diesel is starting from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday use car .
Airline does not stick : crash on aviation power
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of DÃ¼sseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) is a liability for liability in d@@ angers which are typical for air traffic .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken up at the fall of a kne@@ e gra@@ b .
the accident would have had anywhere , however - it handles a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the organis@@ er
after their journey , after their journey only money back then , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was severely beaten in di@@ arr@@ he@@ a on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ eness and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ists back to a def@@ ective folding situation , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that had been a man@@ oeu@@ vre and def@@ aul@@ ted against the promot@@ er .
before the court , the claim@@ ers had no success .
in fact , the situation was faul@@ ty .
but the organizer was just short before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the verdict .
especially during the samples of the water , no contamination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ less among others - belonged to the general living risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re told the violence of violence in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach , in July , many people were wor@@ ried about other attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and decided to react to terror at the same time .
certainly is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
we will not succeed this triumph with the terror@@ ists .
if criminal off@@ ences would have to leave the country , the height above the security and strength of the population will also apply to the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re wants to implement a proposal by the European Parliament election until 2017 .
he announced also a further management rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ sized orders over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism must be returned under punishment .
video surveillance needs to be improved that ce@@ ase@@ fire may be as amended , especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is used .
the very much @-@ discussed swe@@ at light for doctors should remain according to de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨res &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical conditions , he wants to search for solutions how to reduce the haz@@ ard of the citizens , he said with a look at the psych@@ ic di@@ lig@@ ations .
in order to meet a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary .
teachers would have to be prepared better in dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
to the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is planning an investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that concern safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister is clearly pronounced against action .
&quot; this was a thor@@ ough for the hin@@ ge in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re had rejected Ru@@ fe in the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality .
a gen@@ eric prohibition of complet@@ eness to be justified with constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t forget everything you re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .

better traffic flow on the motorway
there are regularly on the ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legislation has to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in the professional traffic on the surrounding road every night when they ride over the highway via Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction company extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the direction of Wes@@ eler Road is one lane gauge 700 meters .
drive then directly from the hammer to the right .
the big advantage : traffic spl@@ its itself early , making the total occurr@@ ence on a long @-@ driven section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District Court of MÃ¼nster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is very nerv@@ ous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return trip dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way , and sometimes also beyond .
this is why the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 is shortly before the direction of Wes@@ eler Road .
from here traffic can only pass a track on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back over thirty @-@ four@@ ths of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had found that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to absorb the heavy duty of the heavy duty .
how long the bott@@ len@@ eck and the temporary inj@@ un@@ cture has lasted , the responsible state can not say .
however , at years of age : for the bridge has an official trading period of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislation of the legislation has been deliber@@ ately chosen for the transport time in the school holidays , because they are to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
the traffic will be run on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

rain instead of shooting : hope on weather progress
the weather made the d@@ wind@@ ling Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stake in the night - but there are hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain so that the heavenly spect@@ acle was observed , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ cent , which include 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star d@@ olls .
they have their names , because they seem to be apparent from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us which is in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for ins@@ om@@ nia
in the evening we will roll off for ever , at night there is hour for hours in the morning , and in the morning it is not far to think of sleep .
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , one of these problems with such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , it has approximately one quarter of adults sleep distur@@ b@@ ance and more than ten percent , sleep often or permanently recovered .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , and there are many different causes are under@@ lying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ e@@ Ã , member of the German Society for Com@@ missions and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what you under@@ stands , however , however , the In@@ som@@ nia is never , so an I and a sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess .
just the sleep can be found as harm@@ less or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the German House@@ hold association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ b@@ ance are complex .
behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or ra@@ cial @-@ related factors , but also consult medicines .
the ins@@ ane expression of another condition is not rare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awak@@ ening is common with depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ Ã . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
who for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to gre@@ asy on all @-@ day problems and give thanks , We@@ e@@ Ã is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should I get to the doctor with sleep problems ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite differently , tired , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleeping trou@@ bles , it is important to find out its causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablet only in case of acceptance and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
headquartered in Germany there are hardly noticeable in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ ore , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ itÃ© University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should contact for sleeping difficulties at first time , at home , We@@ e@@ Ã is at first .
the can clari@@ fy with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory physician , for example , with breathing difficulties , in disease @-@ heart@@ ly di@@ ast@@ ness , at sleep , or when you do not find the cause of a passage of a passage , says Fi@@ bre .
it is not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ bre .
after glu@@ ing , you go into the bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body you are wearing a nose , chest strap and a antenn@@ ae .
in addition , a camera sees the sleeping room to the ceiling .
how can I get any problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of locking screws on which you can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ Ã is on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not to sleep to sleep , alcohol before and at night not at the clock - then you start to expect immediately , and that &apos;s all and not eligible to ensure that .
what is the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German flo@@ at Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been dis@@ ap@@ pointing to the DS@@ V teams at the Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
in December 2014 he took up gold for the first time in Doha and took up his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected via Facebook to be protected against his former former ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 â¬ Pr@@ emia and one jung@@ le of 150,000 â¬ should not wonder about lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the feed system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , were very good .
that &apos;s why we can not compete with countries that do not require a lot and operate at the topic D@@ oping - not so accurate or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be hired here , &quot; he explained .
if he wanted to com@@ eback to com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported already nine months before his first start of the national anti @-@ d@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly how to keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de Ban@@ de Bag@@ gage R@@ ails
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the DÃ¼sseldorf Airport
civil invasion of the DÃ¼ssel@@ dor@@ fer police was able to arrest two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts alleged that Ban@@ de had committed several pocket and luggage bars .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs civilian civil servants detected a ban@@ de again at the airport DÃ¼sseldorf Airport , which was known as the polic@@ emen from last theft .
the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ph@@ ins in the middle of July of this year and have been working very professional .
the specialists of the crime nov@@ els 34 can do the dens@@ ities , specifically for off@@ ences of offen@@ ders to Germany , four do@@ ings .
they had a total of more than 15.000 euros .
Alt@@ buildings , a few Left Baker , in between even a rest head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous sites &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one comes to play places , a refresh@@ ing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
for the facade of a gray house som@@ eb@@ ody has ug@@ ly ! &quot; spec@@ kl@@ ed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it will be built here : by 2017 there is an house with a high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
article about these &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are pre@@ illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks .
this is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , meanwhile the residents are occupied , but there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator had several times for a tough approach to the project , the well known as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
having been cleared on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , had pat@@ ched the police three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site , closed parts of the road and held visitors from it to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building staff in the order of the unknown house owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , sitting in front of the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others entert@@ ain about Sp@@ et@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are mainly from the police site .
with the residents of skin projects they distribute the concern before rising rentals and genetic disorders .
it does not sound according to a pine , which wish to handle more complex protection from v@@ and@@ al@@ ating left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin sp@@ ens@@ or@@ ator and police between cattle and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional labour area , which today has a lower average age and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
also houses and the nati@@ ves are already long to the surrounding area : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including virtually the whole main@@ road street near the Riga .
while the ma@@ inst@@ ances were cleared under a controlled road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are still inhabited by people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter in the past few years became increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner of all over the world : with them now residents of GDR times and former houses will divide their p@@ ine@@ z .
this can also be felt during rentals in 2009 , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them missing slices or fresh@@ ly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to paint .
no other road this year was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
one reason for this , that not all neighbours can be seen as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : offen@@ ders such as body injuries , according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make up atomic facts rather the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years , can no talk of un@@ certainty .
what violence is concerned is it important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who don &apos;t have been determined .
also the famous burning cars will give you no longer in the Riga car anymore .
for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal case , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , living together on the road and gets more of each other with , than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn and stayed in the Riga street .
therefore , it was so important that the residents got their way back : by the police , politics and media , which in July all suddenly taken the deadline over the neighborhood .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through new buildings built in former buildings , which inhab@@ it the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are finally con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Viol@@ ence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction can &apos;t be gu@@ essed . &quot;
but what should one do if a man never stops ?
it focuses on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are over color bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
who attrac@@ ts , should be aware of it - just like someone , who moves in a quarter @-@ quarter , can be easily compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons named in the fore@@ name have asked to be asked to be named , not named with its name .
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee institution
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organiz@@ ational matters .
also she is a social worker spot .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been a refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it can be seen as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administrative , authorities and who else are missing .
RE@@ G@@ INE client of the working group indicates that the honorary might have more than than@@ k@@ ful , that Deu@@ ver@@ le now is there , the pleasure of wo@@ ol@@ factory , which has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cking as much instead of the variety of tasks wish to be targeted - commonly referred to as the administration wanted to write the place .
we searched for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a whol@@ es@@ hip wo@@ ol@@ factory .
but administrative labour is not its central area , comments appro@@ ach@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , there are about organization , working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
she had a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer who supports An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Ehr@@ en- and Great official actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straÃe
it has been a serious problem since some time , to find flats for the close @-@ fle@@ ets that have been recognized .
the municipalities are competent for connecting the connection .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented hab@@ itats .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
responsibility has been changed from Land@@ rat@@ chet to the community and a job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to do not find private apartments .
it has not been working so far , to get to private apartments , then Deu@@ ver@@ le .
hence the rural homes must be am@@ ous , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straÃe .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a permanent stay there are inter@@ places , training places , school places , one @-@ Euro jobs and encour@@ agement for refugees and migrants that have to be m@@ illed or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do @-@ profit @-@ making work - and the motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outdoor effect .
this was &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not only work .
the day do a solid structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
men would have to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so , offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
this also jump in management and honorary positions .
it is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense to the time , for example , with language courses .
those who could get the feeling of development , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate itself .
the significant majority are motiv@@ ated .
problem cases are but also , says customer hon@@ est , &quot; People where nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack is called ch@@ ai@@ v like &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a remaining risk could but not complete them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sen@@ si@@ zing are the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents were also the subject of refugees .
they were afraid that the attack they had completely destroyed completely .
