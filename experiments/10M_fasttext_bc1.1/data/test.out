gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gains the pil@@ es of stones
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lang@@ er sought a little variation with some colleagues at a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes , the horses remin@@ ded their closing night , they pursued the fast gal@@ lop of home to the feeding branches .
one kilometer during this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the e@@ quest@@ rian arri@@ ers ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he led to his family through the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he couldn &apos;t look at photo@@ co@@ als .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe encour@@ ages the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala of Golden Athlet@@ es .
there won &apos;t be hon@@ est@@ able athletes of the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Ar@@ rest Cross , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour players of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already applied him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the pil@@ es of stones .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for they are not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lang@@ he has been promoting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more outstanding athletes competing in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the events were born : athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schm@@ itt , who is acting on Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ is@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@
many of these sports participants came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society mig@@ rated to the jum@@ per stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - which is to both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
un@@ one are the two US presidential candidate at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are based on a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy will harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton to regul@@ ate the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be completely different , said Tr@@ ump .
he will drive some ra@@ uli@@ ers massi@@ vely , and he makes himself a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton against that says : the state has appointed certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money .
that is why the tax for the rich is increased , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton become almost wor@@ t@@ ely .
the democratic candidate , announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are the classic @-@ democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical team @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so there could be an internal discussions on the tr@@ ump .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and res@@ ili@@ ze coal plants in the US again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris Climate agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to expand and ur@@ ges the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will make the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only for infrastructure - also at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far away from each other .
T@@ PP , which is a trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both of them want to ins@@ ulated the United States by the international trade , but simply protect American jobs .
they then should be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
what tr@@ ump in this question is not clear : once say he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ on , then he says he will not be changed .
but the great discussion of the next months is likely to develop more about the control policy of both bearings .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ load the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics have before him , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton says that at least from the rich he wants to pay more tax , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who alone will flee , almost as long as everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often sad .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
each has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has laid her little son into the arm .
he sn@@ ails with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother st@@ icky on the table top .
till it is noticed that it is observed .
they sm@@ iling short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is part of Con@@ dro@@ bs division , a sponsor for social auxiliary offers in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Relief Association .
it has recently been opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made on her run experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically pursued because of them torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope to Europe , &quot; says it .
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honor of honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives her away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that t@@ ug@@ boat for a bottle of water for a bottle of sexual action is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , tell B@@ ahr .
the standing women would often be regarded as a min@@ d@@ ful women in refugee quot@@ as often and ab@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the Munich &apos;s North , is sad and estimates .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are as usual that they can say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trust not to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not need to help others , it need more accommodation only for them , requ@@ est@@ ing B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven district ra@@ ins are responsible for the placing of refugees .
to the question whether they w@@ asted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no .
in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something that should not be found in governments of governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women alone are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press review of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia are available in some common floors or their own houses only for single and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the European Parliament &apos;s rights and gender equality must also be challenged by women to be separated from men .
in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are set up separately . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for lack of privacy or become men and women , it can come to - for@@ getting - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , in the study .
like the women of this protection need , one can read on And@@ alu@@ d , which there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; since that time has been spoken , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could make a second house lightly .
assist@@ ants strike : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new jobs
as representatives of the assist@@ ants , their union representatives will be called to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has required its entire Council , from the beginning of September more working relief measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that it was ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go to the concerns relating to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assist@@ ants and medical students have voted on the re@@ jection of a contract to agreement with BM@@ A on July 2014 .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday night on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government had remained &quot; been quiet@@ ly quiet &quot; to problems , what was denied that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of what the J@@ DC board voted to complete the proposed new contract in complete and un@@ official new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board appointed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of calendar work measures that begins in early September .
the disp@@ utes reported that assistant doctors of this year began six times , the first total events in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A assistant doctors , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana was the head of the agreed contract conditions , which had been suggested by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical assist@@ ants that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jeremy Hunt , said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be implemented .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external vibr@@ ations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and the official end of the eight months of lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter in the gilded hall in the St. Petersburg Palace of St. Petersburg , I cannot make sure that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation .
there was the action , yes .
but putting into the smile had its nar@@ row@@ ly and radi@@ ated warmth , even for his rest@@ rained conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an spoke to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had so ben@@ evol@@ ve , than that would never happen something worse .
my enthusiasm seemed to me rather the opposite .
but one of Putin was brilliant , sustainable cooling showed that the Russian state of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ alled burning .
Putin divi@@ des and accused Ankara to withdraw Russia into the back .
the insur@@ rection was even bigger , since it was committed by a good friend .
the show@@ cases re@@ build again will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media initiated a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once it seemed to be , the Turks would bear all the gu@@ ilt .
most seriously , the alleg@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials were benef@@ ited from their own family from illegal oil retailers in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look back .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin was trying to ap@@ preh@@ end the President of the President Erd@@ og@@ an that he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice are clear at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs primarily all friends who can get received after he became the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic images .
Russian sanctions were hard hit in Turkey - in particular , the ban of char@@ ters that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and bat@@ ches will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ oc@@ onal side tower in the Mediterranean .
this week , the national television appro@@ ached fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural products are imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i formulated this way : &quot; tourists &quot; &quot; tourists &quot; long &quot; &quot; &quot; long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is we@@ al@@ able in the West , since its reaction to power was considered a weak answer .
to this end , the continued h@@ anger of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian state @-@ of state won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the chosen state of State .
that is well @-@ known for Moscow a self @-@ intelli@@ gible , which has changed a deeper fear@@ ful fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ zer .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in the sea enabled the Russia and Turkey , one as it described me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of out@@ sider &quot; : two countries who are cat@@ ching off from the West and po@@ or@@ ly treated so bad@@ ly .
nonetheless , despite the public conc@@ iliation , there are always great differences between the two others .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace of peace , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sites .
it might be significant that after almost three hours , both pre@@ sidents appeared on the press conference , said they would not have under@@ gone the topic once .
the President of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize it .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator could be found in Syria .
but after months open host@@ ilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , as NATO member Turkey declared the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland are no longer available
according to the board of directors of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a Back@@ office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland .
by Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand have been connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself so far , when it had had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; brand @-@ mounted brand &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have been used to protect other end consumer brands .
she supported the international sports with millions of £ in sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by until the Wimbledon winner of Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to look more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the central head office and the stock market will switch to Nat@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private clients that will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees are employed , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are no global targets , but local objectives .
each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working under these stamps .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsor@@ ing no longer , and that it will increase the perc@@ eptions of the various brands in their sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time to develop itself to the bank of brands , for how we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very c@@ yn@@ ical , if we said we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think it will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

the three @-@ person winner D@@ ett@@ ori which previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy that it &apos;s been at New@@ market , because I landed some 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a band Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am ligh@@ tened and modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori occupies the Ju@@ bel , when he brings the victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction .
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the ste@@ ep@@ est race in the ste@@ ep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 times winner of Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time D@@ ed@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career bars
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone in just days before it .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct , who distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusi@@ astic fans for this sport since years .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already won 6.000 winn@@ ings when he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has won almost 30 years of winning players , what &apos;s great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition it is an incredible vintage jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone in a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

three years ago , at the beginning , he had left trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month sperm , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fer his branches and return to his best .
and yet it &apos;s not yet a long time at the end of the D@@ ett@@ ori last year , that he wants to continue in cont@@ ests until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin hum@@ ert Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin reli@@ eved his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the close contact of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport issues .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin was de@@ ferred under his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was the deputy @-@ representative of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital , Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of log head and administration of the government &apos;s government .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of government to assist your activity as state @-@ of @-@ of @-@ the law and insp@@ ections on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ade the sm@@ iling Fac@@ es ?
this stage has made secret lost in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of a close contact of Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV in television , both men deemed that the Chief of Staff was re@@ directed at his own request .
but despite being a lot for cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections .
is this a consequence of a kind of power combat ?
the one knows no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once glorified as a potential President was to lead to even the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin I said Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation between the beginning of 2012 - they could have been very complicated - they could have been able to trust - requ@@ est@@ able for four years .
as it emerged , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as a former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Aviation Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov became deputy chairman of his deputy .
when Putin met his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in most of them .
once , Ivan@@ ov was supposed to be President of Russia in Put@@ to the second term of President of Russia , since a third term of putting into the Constitution had been cast against the constitution .
but this item was taken by another , near @-@ end ally plaster , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became a president in three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he smote producers
Gibson was also involved in a physical con@@ front@@ ation at the Set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his termination in a common position .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , l@@ act@@ himself on Thursday before the announcement of his notice .

Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ds of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which near the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rotary valves .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy K@@ eit@@ h Brown was appointed a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of a short@@ fall in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ fer activity that require extreme precise tolerances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of all Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ cks in their place and the last part of the de@@ cks are in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents a tr@@ end@@ setting top and deep construction .
after the installation of the last street @-@ section and its connection with the northern northern hemisphere , we had to close the still existing gap on the North or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern town bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ icky job .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , approx . 6,000 tons , and at a gradient of approximately 3 % had to be moved .
fin@@ cle because the tolerances , which the team is working , they were tiny - at each side , it amounted to only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we looked like the boat in its proximity to turned and brought us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the life station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; than@@ k@@ fully , the strong winds ble@@ w up the boat except of its reach until we left water , &quot; he added .

who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs low apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors are expected to be taken much stronger in the future .
how to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 inexpensive dwellings in the coming years ?
the SPD suggests the next ratings for the &quot; Action Concept Living . &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are pleased to build us with the Green : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to exhibit as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the affordable housing can however also be made in our inventory .
however , the grand pi@@ v@@ ot in the Town Hall is however , called Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you go with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but preferably 20 percent of dwellings as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new residential building programme that will cost millions and will be financed even to incenti@@ vi@@ ze .
the problem so viol@@ i : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as short as possible .
the lin@@ ke wants even more rigi@@ dity for investors .
regardless of these , viol@@ i , ex@@ h@@ ort a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the skilled workers .
however , the program is not completely completely : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be tra@@ ded in .
but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose mining is going to go out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ing spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought for the current ties of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about it to bring apartments back to the bond .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
one fell on a blow to solve the problem .
the west city run to the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could take you back to the price of favorable flats .
only : this will not want to do the owners , housing corpor@@ ations .
because the number of social con@@ domin@@ iums in the West@@ stadt will be dra@@ stically increased again , one is the aim of the so @-@ called tran@@ spl@@ ash .
a concentration of social cont@@ emp@@ t in just a few districts should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens said that there will be motion in the discussion .
leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a wide majority the CDU have to be made with the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating , how the world has changed .
that teen@@ ager and child did not go beyond outside , but rather prefer@@ able to spend their free time in doing on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it will cause people to collect and active people from the sofa .
the time at the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and last@@ ly limited to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are unable to exclu@@ de each other .
I inter@@ connect myself of course to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created for video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , games cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture sunk the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand which over@@ load the servers .
within few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ ym@@ s and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go with their smartphone outside , looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found once , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which reg@@ ained the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
with Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 users , announced that the Washington Post informed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , that j@@ ump@@ ed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data of the performance increase .
many public awareness campaigns to take up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day to be active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are bo@@ red and people are coming to everyone who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly drives sport , reduces his opportunities to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to run it here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there are people to do something in the open , that fun makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health benefits - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close the hunt for new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ g game destro@@ ys , that must always be compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone Apps were already able to follow our activity as Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game .
the new will lose his matur@@ ation and the use will be returned with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will join apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people in the hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the j@@ umping horse .
effort@@ less on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic Champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ ands on Thursday to the multi event title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
the overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team nationals A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ keys on the Swedish brothers during the single majority of women in the arts at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual amer@@ ican player , who wins a combined campaign and had a total of the fifth , while she is a reputation to be the best of its generation or even ever .
it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was at the end .
this success introduces it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought her sports with new heights :
it has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world champion - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected it a last test in Brazil , a competition , which was not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather , between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful of gold to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , after they have gained gold and silver in the individual combined events of women in the arts at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
it took the first medal to Tuesday during the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a call@@ sign .
even though it insi@@ sted on the top of having planned the future , this is not really true .
a part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would match at home on the street outside of the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
that is not acci@@ dental .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no more lost competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak which will hold so long as it wishes .
even if pattern was slightly led by two tor@@ ches , the picture suspended the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ et and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which image stops the world title - lau@@ ded .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating floor again - and placed one on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her to her final bur@@ ial - pure form@@ ality and tears in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue p@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collective book to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went on a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team competition , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
according to their ground exercise , she designed the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly appeared .
as a result , the rapidly spread of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a brand new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mur@@ der@@ ers killed during musical listening in the car
according to police report , which were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who were killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks on a decade in the first serial port of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a pilgrimage .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight sh@@ uts out of a hand fire@@ arm while sitting on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another car , is read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of an smo@@ ker all @-@ over , since the attack@@ er didn &apos;t carry the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting started investig@@ ating a investig@@ ator to see if it is connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven attacks were killed in nine attacks seven people within four months , and two more injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house &quot; organized by Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to prove the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are associated and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised by their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died .
a witness to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities have also published a police report on the shooting , which ended up an empty Pick@@ up @-@ Truck up half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial port .
investigations found pat@@ ron@@ g@@ uts and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ zep@@ ool : &quot; it &apos;s better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his age@@ ing did Edmund micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorders that knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought I was not .
I will not make it .
I didn &apos;t let me down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right -- of course - of course , you told it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has informed her husband Vincent and her husband , that Edmund she may never recogn@@ ise under any circumstances that he may not survive one time .
some doctors even went so far that they struck him to support him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; explained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a remedy .
Edmund continued to sit cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year of life , neither can he talk yet .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run and biking with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character call@@ sign , which Edmund for &quot; Please sing something &quot; out of &quot; . &quot;
&quot; we give him a character language in &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character set -- says it . Edmund has found some signs alone .
micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund , and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is too early to say how to influence the life of the av@@ av@@ irus @-@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional prize of a certain future .
I question@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have no longer asked for the forecast for a long time because I don &apos;t expect it to really say goo@@ db@@ ye to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with native injuries caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I pre@@ ach@@ able to help me among women &apos;s Olympi@@ ad in the Tur@@ nen and that is more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ ing many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is cath@@ olic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has been the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast , one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year was Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America during the last Olympic Games .
now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible achievement of the three @-@ fold world champion , Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they had expected , but most widely used Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone , the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual men , who won women for women in an individual combined event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experi@@ encing the top of this sport , but this is not visible classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ashed all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic script will only have four pairs of tur@@ ers in the team . in addition , Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi was the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality is that spl@@ itting a more expensive sport is and Turner &apos;s primarily associated with parents that are waiting for training , entry , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these societies , Turner receive its total training and for the families a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since it started with the tower .
we must make the municipalities of Au@@ n numerous , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a safe and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
for my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ ast@@ eries in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) offered by national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer a high @-@ quality tower to learn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination of the body as well as hard work , discipline and setting for the spirit .
this combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for the school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
that is so exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with a different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggest@@ ion
the ministers agreed to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants , who abst@@ ained from election .
in July , Hunt plans revealed to lead the treaty and said that N@@ HS had to be employed in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land &quot; associations and any further delay for employees and patients .
the first assistance of assistance should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ - and weekend work to improve care of continuous movements .

at only eight weeks that remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by BM@@ A contribute to the solution of disp@@ utes ar@@ ising with regard to government &apos;s government and sometimes leads to coh@@ er@@ ful swe@@ ep .
that was the meaning of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made this last month , that his door would always open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to act now to lift up the action and the wor@@ ries of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , he did not have the assistant doctors that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 sched@@ ules , since n@@ urses and medical doctors were included in order to grant doctors on strike post@@ code cover .
the ministers promised to finish the dispute over the modifications by an acceptance of the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , encouraged the assistance of assist@@ ants to strike the strike .
Mor@@ ti@@ dy said : &quot; labour measures reach nothing but the just a little , but already more load@@ able teams and service providers and prepare for the patient , care and their families are wor@@ ried , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months , we have been talking to the committee of assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries a positive impact on the concerns relating to the officers and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employ@@ ers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as aston@@ ishment , flexibility in training , training courses and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign that health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness levels may flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the occasion of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ dence has led to the pro@@ ving elec@@ toral fr@@ aud in Muslim congregations will be ignor@@ ant like a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es ri@@ p@@ ens the police , election agent and Rath@@ geber for it to ignore the evidence of elec@@ toral violence related to eth@@ nic@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government now , which is now a ant@@ acid disc@@ ern@@ ess , said that the in@@ firm@@ ities of voters from religious moti@@ ves should be simply that the police should be permitted to protect shut@@ ters outside of election cabins in order to protect pi@@ vot@@ al voters .
he recommends that voters should have a identity card to prove their identity in the elections .
at present , a voters must name only his name and address .
the report suggests , non @-@ ink ink on the fingers of a person when they vote their elec@@ toral vote to prevent som@@ eb@@ ody cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should obtain more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official administrative or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election @-@ election , but also the municipal government plans to protect against the wider corruption and financial ul@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the East of London .
last year , a special report decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be moved to a lit@@ eral on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; and had per@@ ver@@ ted his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ ame .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that the reli@@ es of Muslims has been to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ ted or consequence of a follow @-@ up , where one person cho@@ oses other than someone other .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fr@@ aud in the whole country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community had made print on people to choose a candidates of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the guide to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that printing on protection members had exercised several ethnic min@@ orities , particularly women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ an@@ dic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were obj@@ ections to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state institutions such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning eth@@ nic@@ ities as well as religion could be ignor@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban being made political activists material to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is made by Ther@@ esa May is required , demands the tough@@ er registration investigations to prevent that the elec@@ toral folder is used for immig@@ ration and social welfare purposes .
for options , select elec@@ tors prior to your selection .
do not take distance ink on the finger of a person as soon as it has given her voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on assign@@ ments to automatic post@@ ure sel@@ ector .
ban on political activ@@ ist and envelop@@ es of correspondence .
the police give the request of locking points for election stations .
a bill of law that invol@@ ve an charge for in@@ compliance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( German Federal Law of Law 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ers in election stations .
request that only English may be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( excluding Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the workout to ensure that the staff will rule over the rule that voters want to go alone into the turn@@ tables alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no pen@@ al display .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral Court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ eral on corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ ly explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons for in@@ suff@@ iciently - according to the high demands on the criminal procedure - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the elections of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said , &quot; The court sur@@ fer in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country is as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud inheritance , but the poss@@ essing and deep@@ ening of poll@@ s and emp@@ t@@ ance of some authorities re@@ thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ der and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics are viewing this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , apart from the edge and band , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ rate of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ics in this summer is far not the only one to fight gold fighting Ath@@ let who has his own famous bi@@ ans - at least not if you may remember the social media faith .
to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ ads which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with the Hollywood @-@ famous .
the fighter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from the person Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , a lot of people on the Internet , as a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the Team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after some pictures where he looks like a w@@ olf of Wall Street star out of secret .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness to the social media with and gave that he had already heard her childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself do not see a great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a happy guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will be und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly coming to the center : the simil@@ arity between the British wide range Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through to the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ in .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one ais@@ le higher : this user is of view that Nathan the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor is
another sustained comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ h who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ on@@ ary hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ est@@ ed to Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; an athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only one : one Twitter user was very happy about that other the simil@@ ar@@ ities are also abandoned .
the theory has been made in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of a couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter mar@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet think that Hope and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar fac@@ ial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , big smile , which resem@@ bles that of Stri@@ ke It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous spot , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ em@@ .com could make it a little saf@@ er for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to tackle armed rob@@ bers at the nearby distance .
regardless of whether you come from the front or from behind it will show you this video as you turn the sk@@ ewer for your th@@ iev@@ es .
if you att@@ aching to you from behind , then you should see to see your attack@@ ers and enter &quot; from the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon before your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
beat him with the kne@@ e into the l@@ ath and turn it down , while the attack@@ ers collap@@ sed from pain . beat the weapon from his hands . beat the weapon on the face and move on back@@ ward while they set the weapon on him .
when you are attack@@ ing , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the gun and turn them away so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
sei@@ ze the weight at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before moving forward and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
check out the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .

Reis@@ itting Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to put his tongue on the most dirty places of Europe
a British travel subject to its immune system and dig@@ nity of a serious examination - having dra@@ ining some of the most poll@@ uted and f@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar sites in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and vo@@ y@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will hand over to a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a pull @-@ out space as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system .
in front of the le@@ ak every object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show yourself and show us what he turns .
but the experiment , that was filmed by the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results of daylight .
the thought to hide the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull @-@ out space which has already been used by thousands of others , can be fully e@@ ased , but actually there are more poor bacteria .
in his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily nothing left everything he left , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things as well as wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from public money to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing n@@ ul@@ ls of toilets , the task turned his immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns and I have put all things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in his film he was just righteous for his call .
the only thing that he was refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his dent@@ ures showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ance of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to be refused after their lumin@@ ance had over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a little less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial population at different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst thing that I have ro@@ asted in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;ll feel nothing at this , because there is indoor use here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company took Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .

we performed crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that we finished saying &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
it claim that the interest in health business is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the significance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and we could provide the consumption of more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , said : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , when he had tast@@ ed some of the things I have instructed to him , like the ek@@ y Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things , where it was sim@@ pler , Ian , to bring it , and others where this was quite hard .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of this dirty le@@ ak@@ eup on film . &quot;
in a survey carried out from the year 2015 , 84 percent of those question@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ og@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ z , Corn@@ wall
a con@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a delay in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ um@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall cast .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from her estate , sho@@ cked people of housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ rever@@ able state .
the walls were abandoned , wood sh@@ ri@@ m@@ ps have been raised , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on a floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to walls .
the family were moved and it is believed to live in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they feared not to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I &apos;m the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this estate is probably not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and her call is also .
the couple had three sons , the temporarily lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had given the family , street strug@@ gles with bas@@ eb@@ ooks , ad@@ mis@@ ery of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drugs and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an order for anti @-@ electronic behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under circumstances , old litter is found .
in the property , in which the past drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wooden di@@ ps have been torn .
neighbours said they wanted to fight them on the streets and called the police regularly !
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed them and their partners to leave this week , after having a prolonged period of 11 weeks for an extended period of 11 weeks .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neigh@@ bors who told her life to hell .
one said , &quot; They were interested in vain . &quot;
we lived 20 years in addition to them and it was bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , wherever they are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was ab@@ duc@@ ed the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years .
on the over@@ coming side of the Municipal House , gar@@ bage and old toys were sunk
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the Mi@@ l ab@@ hor@@ des to assume any responsibility for their behaviour and her family as a Del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing has taken into account .
that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely fear@@ ful and their deeds for her neighbours had to be broken .
I guess all the work , my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church which have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information provided .
I hope that the development of some neighbours is consol@@ ation and the message will not be toler@@ ated that ant@@ is@@ o@@ idal behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress included in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation left on the floor
workers of the house management are now heated by a land@@ fill , the house surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police arrested a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine penalty after it was found guilty of the possession of a drug B in trade .
it claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 by a car accident .
after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation at Plymouth .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not stick a r@@ enter , which do not stick to the rules of house
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall wrote that Del@@ og@@ ation had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the rules of house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who may remember that they have been killed without self @-@ deduc@@ tions , as well as to those who were killed by such a behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ political behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .

this was the moment , in the fri@@ gh@@ tened tourists start to grow in pan@@ ic after an ti@@ effect jet about a full beach crashed .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ancy went up when they under@@ stand@@ able to make worry about the noise of the nozzle tra@@ pped , without fir@@ stly to see what came through the clouds at her .
the incident happened yesterday in the afternoon at Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the countless artists who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it descended . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just at surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down to me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved in pan@@ ic as the plane escaped from the darkness and it was incredibly low .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on aircraft was found on a training flight to identify f@@ ish@@ boats before the coast and thereby had to fly out that this was the only possibility to recogn@@ ise them .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet is slightly lower than usual in the vicinity of bad view conditions . however , the Air Force was able to end@@ ure that the safety of no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four men came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly in due to the ratios - a strong b@@ m@@ ist and bran@@ t - as low as its vision was reduced .

Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting the first step towards the first step in the new soccer season .
the Catal@@ ans qu@@ arri@@ ed in Du@@ eling around the Spanish Super cup starting to FC Sevilla , the return is rising for three days later in Camp Nou .
the Dou@@ ble@@ Tree needs to compete in the forces with the underground Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reg@@ ained Europe @-@ League Champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar who den@@ ies the Olympic Football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e are also missing .
the Germans suffered a change @-@ dust in the kne@@ e with which the ser@@ en@@ quiries regarding Bar@@ ca should be clari@@ fied at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Stadium in Barcelona have been one number one for two years now .
coach Luis En@@ rique is ren@@ ounced on a clear decision on so far and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but that T@@ er St@@ egen enters most of the remaining acqu@@ is@@ itions .
prior to the first mandatory match of the new season , there are doubt about the Spanish team of the team , who hum@@ bled Saturday in a test match of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ spect@@ acle against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. is still not really convincing .
Sevilla opened the 2 : 3 defeat after receiving the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid to di@@ gest the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with its eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in a separate league in p@@ ong @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis @-@ Olympic Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a single finals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the world premi@@ er lists the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournament and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ che@@ ani .
the two Chinese were made as expected in the final match and made the title one another .
this was clear that for the third time a Chinese won the single titles in the sign of the five rings .
the last non @-@ chin@@ ese war on the top of the Olympia was the former SV S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the record alone , between the movements and during time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they had pulled off the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their tra@@ stu@@ ds in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches till I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been tor@@ tured for me in the finals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma was really strug@@ gling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first proposition .
after that , he pointed out the temp@@ o at the top and dropped by 13 points , only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma was not developing the expected exciting match .
but there were not enough stunning ball change to see .
Mi@@ ron@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ze had emerged in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was afterwards in medical treatment , was forced to settle &quot; with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump Lo@@ t ″ hard problems ″ in the campaign fight
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , also in traditional con@@ serv@@ atives states .
presidential candidate of Donald Tr@@ ump now announced the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can High@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a less moment , in which the normally large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals of his own Republi@@ can camp within his own Republi@@ can camp , now doubt the doubt about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Evangelical Christians who asked for support in major federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
false reports are false reports on his candidate , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media reports .
Republi@@ can Se@@ ated W@@ ack@@ ing
Ut@@ ah is normally a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
as a pol@@ l of Surv@@ ey@@ s in June , Tr@@ ump and its competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump , however , not by the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state of Germany .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be end@@ angered .
in an interview of the transmitter of CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump on the question as he had to stop the advance of the Clin@@ ique : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and if back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make any other thing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich in order for the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is the order , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump has to pay attention to the support of its elec@@ toral campaign , it should not be able to present no better rec@@ ess values .
instead of its wool , you can reach the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress stronger than arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister Sc@@ am with D@@ oping test
the IOC will be set up a disciplinary committee for the IOC .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second d@@ oping aff@@ air at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
a coach sent home on a d@@ oping control during a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village .
the International Olympic Committee divided up an order to investigate the case in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian func@@ tionary told that the former Sprinter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village is a ur@@ ine @-@ rehear@@ sal under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team leader Ken@@ ias from the d@@ oping control centers .
the IA@@ AF world association has gained information on the case in order to rig@@ orous his own studies , the IA@@ AF is an IA@@ AF project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will cause an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was written in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and emerged as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated ken@@ es Chef de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list of training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i joined the Beijing World Cup in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan female athlet@@ ics delegation Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to have informed about money @-@ payments of his country about the following d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly was arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
as recently as many d@@ oping control , Kenya has already been under special observation since a long time .
during the announcement of the IOC &apos;s more than 2000 d@@ oping targets before the Rio Olympics , it was previously pointed out that athletes of Kenya and Russia could be taken into vis@@ or .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency led a lot of pressure on African country in front of the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was approved a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
in a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya started from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won the most medals in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , the German charts have always been raised again that in Kenya d@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there is a substantial ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ s .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und claimed a similar study in Kenya , as he had used it in Russian female Athlet@@ ics .
it could be proved that this sport @-@ type surface and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival highlights the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as portable lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ ward masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli did the musical in the temple of the classical music and was filled with Mary &apos;s role in youth .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony led to the management of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in her pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we truly have Bern@@ st@@ ain music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she is remin@@ is@@ cent of her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there were Mari@@ as Personal@@ ity .
she says it in her song : &quot; I like Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh , Pre@@ t@@ ty , I like Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very similar to me to my Italian character , whom I taught as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so great for us to work with her .
it is a monster of man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is for him a need .
you see it in every of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share these musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the American director Philip W@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ conception and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have passed the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York population did not want them .
the same issues are the same topics , and they are exactly the same as the same time .
59 years later , it is still relevant .
London School Girl , which joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school students , left in London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the advoc@@ ate of Tas@@ man@@ je@@ e said that her family knew some weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ ks of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after their family shortly after she had previously left the war@@ fare country and returned to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder , and warning to others that these are the risks associated to go in a war zone - people ever want to make this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the East of Lon@@ d@@ ons increased in a plane in Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas Family has been informed that they have married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months there was a widow .

Tre@@ ats wants to have neck calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere in order to release a 1970 @-@ year Pi@@ relli inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ ics for 2017 .
the editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us early this year that his naked magazine of classic school Play@@ boys are colorful as &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; . &quot;
I do it for women .
apparently , he is the view that the calendar does also do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classical neck , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass repression
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on wrapped suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish municipality in Germany anticip@@ ates a short term of thousands of protective seek@@ ers who fled to Germany from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term it might even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believed the subject of the Group president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard passing of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , after the attempted p@@ utsch of the Turkish president , the Kur@@ dish congregation in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term I reck@@ oning with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term , with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Group president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already crossed high bur@@ ging against pen@@ alties before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey at the run .
after the failed coup , se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added .
many will continue to start in Europe if it is further ex@@ presses in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assi@@ sts himself refugees in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee of Staff accused the targeted investment of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ish cities .
consequently , Erd@@ og@@ an may increase the voyage to the remaining cur@@ sor .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were even wi@@ ped out in the last one hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CDU member .
the post @-@ president demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; hex@@ ag@@ hunting &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics are also held .
in the last months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire market as a quality tra@@ ilers destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics in professional existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on wrapped suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len foundation for Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
like the newspaper stated on appeal to the German Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks reported the biggest group of asylum in Germany in front of the coup of political persecution in Germany .
for the reporting date June 30 , this will be 11.@@ 386 people , thus almost 29 percent of all authorised as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9,@@ 625 ) .
this collection won &apos;t be found in front of war , poverty or Per@@ c@@ tiv@@ eness .
asylum in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so from state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where we &apos;re going to go , &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : the loc@@ als get nothing of summer presidential campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern they understood them .
the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as to date , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and de@@ fer@@ oci@@ a combat - that bit@@ es itself .
the loc@@ als that are to be impressed by the candidates , are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the countryside , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not loc@@ als , so are not allowed to choose the land .
practical problems include : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , spread the posters , fl@@ yers fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and count on the end of the votes only .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to pass over again to Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern once again for election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D will cut and what remains at the end of the runner @-@ up .
S@@ ing , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous round campaign , one can see from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the land , spread forth ros@@ es and pl@@ u@@ cked out a little with the people , as it did most legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff predecessor .
otherwise , sail@@ ering can get cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel em@@ bo@@ unded the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;re creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the legal op@@ uli@@ sts what will now cost him to the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top @-@ class data , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced as it is when you w@@ rest@@ ling to the wrong time at the right place of elections .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel on major expl@@ or@@ ations ; Merkel parliament is in the northeast .
but the target group did not so , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he probably was the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent co@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no man &apos;s eman@@ ating from other corners of Germany , once in Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU relate to the usual election levels on market spaces and shopping m@@ alls with sun umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , co@@ king , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that in the country their base fires that it must be very severe , to find a wire to the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the times of the land hardly available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Council of the CDU elections to his fel@@ low@@ soldier is also self @-@ related : &quot; you have to go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wedding receptions , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot on the game is , the S@@ ing S@@ DP is called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats currently last with 22 percent behind Partner CDU ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD still had a clearly won 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , want to create the jump into the land .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holidays and lay their elec@@ toral campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; states the president of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green elec@@ tors are based on track search for local ab@@ stain@@ ing of the holidays .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ it@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house boat through the Mecklenburg Lake L@@ akes and it is still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from bar@@ ri@@ ers
at the speed of speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing about square .
for the leaders of the construction work which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only ending at 20 o &apos;clock , there are always praise to praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all things are quite cro@@ chet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no delay .
the building site was scheduled to be transferred to the South at the start of October , and by the end of October everything will be ready .
once again the entity is responsible for the construction works , for example , when it comes to the establishment of house drives .
since the construction site was collap@@ sed on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was removed and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been relaxed and relaxed within the resort .
citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the exploitation by the place seems to return .
&quot; there were partly considerable problems , &quot; says the Deputy Head of the Interim Management of Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ut@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ erst@@ raße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to battle with more traffic noise , because many sn@@ aps searched for their Nav@@ i and trusted in their Nav@@ i .
what led to that , some trucks in residential areas have under@@ gone .
as the speed lim@@ bs were not observed , the community called for the brass vehicle of M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable over , &quot; says King , who made itself on site about the location .
there were already two to three per minute .
the fastest speed was at a speed of 77 hours at a speed of 77 hours .
it has been moved to the construction site since the construction site .
for the staff at the B 27 , there is only a small consol@@ ation for customers coming from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to the road again .
they don &apos;t have to look at the cards .
but , however , that the B 27 reconstruction has led to them in sales mer@@ ges , everyone that asks , can look through .
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who are less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other firms , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most light decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but certainly also known that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lear@@ ner fare is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strongest hit the road along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already threat@@ ening .
not just him , but all the restaurants have it &apos; hard hit . &quot;
they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ a@@ eil .
we &apos;ll be glad to be glad for every euro .
the sales revenues amounted to more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road sl@@ ender have thrown his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to be released half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics could have been re@@ acted differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt was on request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , having regard to the information , the restaurant has benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they even have the dis@@ advantages , which caused by the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something generous was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its inn will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
other common guests are now able to understand more frequently due to the complicated traffic management even less frequently .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is pretty nice anyway .
in the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doub@@ ts after the end of the renovation work .
despite the cris@@ es with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction works to its clients for the largest crisis that its inn has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of work is already brutal there .
the terror campaign is continuously har@@ assed in the name of the terror campaign .
according to recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now offering a th@@ icker security package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior on the introduction of his new security package .
they ur@@ ged you up .
other , further points would be discussed within the parties first .
I also involved myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of the Interior , it is situated on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Würzburg and Ans@@ zi@@ ère takes a little time after his recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
but now the fall , however , fell so extensive .
a lot is already known , pro@@ claims that a new safety authority is to worry about the b@@ aked communication , is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications for flight passengers and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities comes as well as sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is launching a second race for proposals that have not been to do with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ y for terror@@ ists below penalty and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU man dre@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , it can still be done for reasonable and challenging even what has no chance at the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist partner .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in themselves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is planning a quick procedure for shi@@ fts and more ways to escape people in front of deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees that are brought specifically to the country are to leave their smart phones and account social media accounts for a security check .
with Dul@@ ings for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than date - about such that off@@ ences will go away or cast their papers in order to dev@@ ise their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally resistant .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
and in some points - at the un@@ equal treatment of thought , the question arises : what does that actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not obvious that the terrorist attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
Moreover , many people in view of the high refugee numbers wor@@ ried about safety .
and things , who in@@ filtr@@ ate people , were now not cl@@ amped in election seasons .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the im@@ pur@@ ge is great .
and yes , there are turn@@ outs .
Union and SPD measures the subject of internal security increasingly in position .
in the past few days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ n@@ ful dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Unions of the Interior , in which the State leaders also require a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is concerned here to reconc@@ il@@ ate sounds too .
from a return from the double pass he is nothing .
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ pri@@ ck , be not sen@@ sible .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he concerns his constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional , and whether it is really &quot; done &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first be shown here .
it &apos;s a lot of things that could cause dispute .
however , the SPD also tries to pro@@ claim the topic of internal safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ ens@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once with careful meeting of talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything to help maintain security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming to come by .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als the delivery pay worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the call action there are vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen launches from the deliveries in the second half of 2015 .
Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ boat can continue to present an increase in the previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air due to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand VW mark@@ eted primarily in Western Europe and loaded with the sale of the company , like the company recorded in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent lower vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales rose 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by nearly a sixth place .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker numbers from July , mainly due to two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets , in some core markets , the change economic conditions has been given .
besides the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote disp@@ ers@@ ed from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the US , where the exhaust gas aff@@ or@@ ated first is es@@ cal@@ ated , there is also a decrease of Min@@ us .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony was further limited by diesel sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition deficit of 0.9 per cent is equivalent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales expansion from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls for some 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW stated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance does not show any deteri@@ oration .
the bus stop to the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed eg@@ ram &quot; certificate , but I didn &apos;t talk about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as was on Friday in the company on Friday .
reason or legal im@@ perfec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee on the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the past Monday .
from the Ministry of Culture , this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fully comply with the editions of my In@@ quiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; stated by the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has acquired the guarantee that reduces fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after upgrading no deteri@@ oration , and all the typical verification of vehicles will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers for example a half year after retro@@ fitting approximately with one engine damage to a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
it is also important to avoid the customer &apos;s customer , that there is nothing to do with the ab@@ ass@@ or@@ ab@@ al damage , which means nothing to do with the ab@@ ass@@ or@@ al guarantee , such as it was called .
therefore , for example , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is required by rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers that park 40 million euros on plaster or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single case and does not see the signal : normal savings would not have to be afraid to pay for their au@@ ster@@ ity pen@@ alties . &quot;
storage Ban@@ ks money above night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this charge requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ ap from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over € 100.000 to gi@@ ro@@ - or day deposits .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been able to rise 40 million euros for some time , that could be withdrawn from one day to the others and cannot be able to understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me on the central bank account and also cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay 4000 Euros for every million Euros . &quot;
from now on , the costs will continue to give the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is simply dropped in the Tres@@ or@@ acle of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had already experienced four inst@@ ances , I did not play the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have their understanding and changed to other investment platforms .
just a few emig@@ rants to other banks .
the cooperative association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone bear alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working permanently not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased its fees for account , credit cards or transactions .
for deposits with deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Bank &apos;s Association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients need to pay for deposits , to do this , the competition in Germany is subject to banks and savings . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; a client@@ ele , who is endowed with some l@@ ush under management . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank account if they are free of charge .
established in 1911 , Co@@ operatives G@@ mund has offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ager , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative organization of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comp@@ lied on deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of June , the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich followed the end of June : &quot; the threshold of the neg@@ atives to go towards the private customers , is very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ us the emig@@ ration from An@@ alloy to the competition .
customers in Germany will not cover the width in the width .
destination plates : who actually buy sil@@ es ?
lon@@ ely men of middle age love sheets .
before you have to divide the comment on it , in order to surprise him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ slip cases with har@@ rows , this statement now runs from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most common re@@ sign@@ ment of sound records came not to an boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that gre@@ et the re@@ alities of physical objects , but due to the Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a plate are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most un@@ likely buyer group .
it is also not hor@@ des by Hob@@ bies - it has a emotional significance : older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend some time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow an news report on TV would like to follow the camera , while I remain in am@@ id@@ st a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , before I stop , my hands hold and somewhat more immense of things like : &quot; so let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw at a glance .
even if the heart rises to So@@ H@@ os slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent S@@ eller are located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I &apos;d like to ask the camera , I would like to switch the camera for the next part in which I meet in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to under@@ estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I say of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours .
is he a collectors , and I ask ?
&quot; I guess &quot; I guess &quot; says he .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 boards .
these sound records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed after him ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available entry : it is now able to buy sheets when he had appeared and again buy articles that he had sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late &apos; 60s , early &apos; 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; says he .
he is true to those who buy the boards , rather giving , and glad@@ ly spend some time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who influenced by the Medi@@ en@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and will have happened to buy their old plates back .
concerning the talks , which I have led , people usually have taken care of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs will now sell their CDs to buy back their records . &quot;
this would explain the boom in a particular age of a particular age .
but what about the inn@@ ate emotional meaning of plates ?
it just takes some seconds in a shop as phon@@ ica to real@@ ise that record business provides a relaxing community of equ@@ ine inn@@ s .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the contact @-@ free payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of the b@@ aff@@ ing plate , from objects to call the happ@@ ier excursions .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of material ownership , as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people so .
it is a simple way to continue intellectual .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of a plate stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people purchased a board have not yet heard .
the survey also revealed that 41 % have a record players who never use them while 7 % of those who have a plate , no turn@@ tables .
at this point of the news report , I probably would look very wor@@ ried about , while I bl@@ amed a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ ile versions .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone only recently came here and said , &quot; I am sitting a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound top that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; says he .
this is not a big percentage but it will definitely happen .
more productive , less musi@@ kl@@ ast@@ y .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who only pur@@ ged slowly .
opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor has a b@@ lower audience , than I go .
there are couples about 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women &apos;s middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops is - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thesis and sex@@ es Pop instead of experimental Jazz goes from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in the customer .
none of them looks strange , but n@@ ag@@ ant psych@@ ic sad@@ ness are hard to be fixed when you see someone at someone for 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and consider the variation of the available plates for sale .
she rather makes a p@@ addle ste@@ aler as a big one .
they don &apos;t earn much , so the collecting of plates do not say real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a lovely pl@@ agues .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers : urban Out@@ back .
while I give the ticket to sample the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager cameras for a moment to purchase Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to hold them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction in these objects could mean more money for the industry , and some customers send in the depths of so@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like boards .
even though my research studies showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v will vote , at least in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collector in S@@ oh@@ o , who exist in reality , sheet shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums are not taken into account .
those people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ roll through Lake stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by sl@@ abs , while they fall short of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoul@@ ders of middle age .

French Court re@@ jects on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , settled .
at a venue this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops within the camp goods , of cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ ote , sell , hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few euro in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture are argu@@ ed that these places would be over@@ thrown because they would not be paid a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that &apos;s a fire and a risk of fire .
all humanitarian groups divided into court with that business and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups are not enough to offer enough food for growing numbers in the warehouse .
they also brought out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accomodation and free meals for people in need to offer .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 provisional shops , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely essential . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food business , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than only people who live &quot; in extremely pre@@ prec@@ ari@@ ous terms . &quot;
he said that the areas of tran@@ qui@@ l relations between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the re@@ mor@@ sel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum for the hundreds of needy people , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition in order to maintain the Kids &apos;s Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; for that children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jung@@ le camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new sl@@ ender in the course of the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be effectively over@@ se@@ ded by the Tem@@ por@@ ters .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be applied to an accident in Wiesbaden , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , to fre@@ eway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with a @-@ time Tem@@ plate , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limit .
a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ately .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days when the case data is transmitted via a modem .
in addition to laser technology , all vehicles on multiple tracks can also be recorded simultaneously .
we can also monitor the variable speed lim@@ es as well as the transfer rate according to time , strips and vehicle class .
the tra@@ ilers can move to the manufacturer according to manufacturer using any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not easy to sound , it is lowered into the measuring mode , so that the wheels are dis@@ cr@@ ushed in the pan@@ ze@@ al and f@@ avo@@ red outside .
it is also possible to protect a built @-@ in alarm system from v@@ and@@ alism .
the trailer has been tested in various German countries since 2015 and has now also been used since 2015 .
also foreign authorities including new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ way ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class car@@ ts
the amazing performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop during the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio here with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji divided a masterpiece in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back of the back , liner and raw force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ aille every color .
the defeat was sunk by the non @-@ bad Tro@@ st@@ Prize of the Silver Medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the B@@ ok@@ s , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day may fall back on them in the final .
but in this form Fi@@ ji could be beaten in this form a 15 man team .
it might be a comfort for GB - but it probably is probably not - that at least a gold medal around his neck will hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief manager Ben R@@ yan , the former boss of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sn@@ ap will wake up , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it was feeling the captain of Tom Mitchell and co . on , when the World Series winners run 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au placed on the corner .
with another four minutes playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he walked .
it has hardly arrived 12 @-@ 0 and GB .
a pre@@ stige of Mitchell stopped off the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third goal but it only stopped Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner was a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning with the re @-@ catch and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou are prec@@ eded by a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gateway .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like it was Fi@@ ji who was born to play the 7 while GB still learn .
it is like that too .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ ag@@ ic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ season , until Joshua was going through Tu@@ is@@ ova following a Br@@ illi@@ ant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started a touch for GB , made a touch down in the left corner of a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favor of the South Atlantic , whose fans sw@@ apped and d@@ anced at the Tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i t@@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is em@@ aged and GB are ro@@ uted and beaten up in the grass .
early on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa into a cris@@ p match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown presented the leg in the first half to the front but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive foot@@ rest and scored a gate to the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Teams , secured the win - thereby the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the train@@ ers to win the rowing ...
there will be no emotional gold when playing these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing boat to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve which enter into the history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it were only the ones sitting on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices im boat . the Echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in branch without tax wife in succession , the first women in the history of the British sports that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ are un@@ le@@ aded operation , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete , which slides over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each Gold at the Ru@@ dern there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to give hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no more helpful than the trainer , who would not know that he would survive this day at all , than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said that he ris@@ ky .
I had a bladder cancer that is operational and they did so .
if you do not do it , he sp@@ read@@ eth everywhere .
it would have been a pretty worse situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to begin the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , so that the inter@@ ruption for a minimum , if this could be the right term even under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was a incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it starts like this .
the rowing itself is a challenge , but this makes it even larger .
in the case of the victory there went their first thoughts to Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning to talk a little more than otherwise and trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also have worked Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would not have a massive Dan@@ ke to him . it is the best trainer in the world .
I wouldn &apos;t have a better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver to reserve a lot in reserves .
we were then imprisoned at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in trial , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of them .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something of the rab@@ ies .
we wanted to see today no fire@@ works , we wanted to win a good result , go out and win the race , what we did so .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions of the future .
since next week , Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer of Steve B@@ shall .
now I want to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ ton Group &quot; , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian brand . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose tool used as a model for large water producers .
so , some time ago , it was written in a review by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia sp@@ ends the purposes .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ed group sailed &quot; Bavarian national as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband employee , was 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water group with seat in K@@ otten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with around 5500 inhabitants .
member states are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for more cities and municipalities .

the outstanding events called it the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of the flood tank ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ generation of water lines .
I have not given a stand@@ still and I resum@@ ed novel@@ ties because drinking water is over and drinking water for the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised G@@ öl@@ lers loy@@ al , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 .
he used himself with a lot of warmth for its water purpose and he has lived with the water @-@ purpose association as well as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he started to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ton Group to nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Water Forum des Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ under too fi@@ dd@@ ess Ma@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best waterfalls and he was a faithful button .
we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he called the fountain and the restructuring of the purpose .
the most difficult challenge , and the difficult use , but the pipe quar@@ ry at the case of Kirch@@ ner is on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be observed once only because they filled the flood of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches .

steel - Light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky agent and energy intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional cost in million@@ aires .
financial loads caused by the industry from the eco @-@ cost promotion threatened , are the table .
in the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es Reg@@ ions , the German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission had originally planned to demand the gases from the high furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , to the bag .
according to the German industry , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , which is now a meeting point with the EU Commission for talks with the competition fer@@ oci@@ ous Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if generators be replaced with the steel units , an EEG conversion of 20 percent will be replaced .
but also this will not be exalted in the steel industry .
the IG Metall had welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on its own power production .
this means that the status Quo would be largely written to date .
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission standards are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China , focused on the world &apos;s largest consumer demand in China , fell on the global market .
European producers t@@ oss Chinese steel con@@ ties price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has quite relaxed .
one hand @-@ educ@@ ated import duties on import duties , to the other have improved economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear how sustainable the prize money is .
the German industry primarily ge@@ aring Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp in the German industry in Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp .
last@@ ly , the prices finally stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector re@@ acts on the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to close the closure of individual works as well .
at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel producers remain careful despite increased prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons and six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the German unification of Germany took place on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the set went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production rose by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation in the next months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : sing pra@@ ys good
the singing has already accompanied her whole life : as a young woman she was in school choir , at the teaching position , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a senior citizen .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels great , che@@ er@@ ful and totally alive , says it .
and at the door of her health , they doing something good at the same time .
because singing is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and divide the joy of music with equ@@ ackl@@ es of music .
through the regular mer@@ ges , senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts .
for often social and family structures are often exposed , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in their choir : &quot; to arrange and to organize and learn to others - a choir is a very special form of the compositions . &quot;
can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ackl@@ es writes .
for they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly requests his lung , even in everyday life are not as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Urs@@ ula L@@ enz from the Swiss Con@@ sortium for the senior citizen .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher degree of power , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people are spar@@ ked many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people themselves escape their lying events in a long time .
in case of singing the head requires a special performance , says L@@ enz .
at the same time to concentrate on their own voice and at a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only practice themselves on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition , which rides through the singing in the choir , H@@ ackl@@ es writes .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing by the singing in the choir .
self : show yourself : if I do something for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - these experience strengthens .
so good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
if anyone wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent , will av@@ enge L@@ enz .
you sing not alone - at 50 sing people who hears it when once a sound goes up next to it ?
in search of the matching offer , Sen@@ ackl@@ es has different possibilities , says H@@ ackl@@ es .
someone s@@ ings from a head @-@ circle in a senior par@@ ench@@ ym@@ a , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer reviews of the choirs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right directly to the church or church .
many seniors will also find over the Internet .
if any one has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask help for the Internet .
those who desire to sing , shou@@ ldn &apos;t connect to a choir .
singing the soul good and has just a liberation - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a cat to yo@@ y of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , the effect of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys are on adult animals .
in her surprise , the males also didn &apos;t get cold - however , they kept the difference to the female always .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ous@@ y degree of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ th@@ ening of the little ones .
they react around ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of Kitt@@ ens , which have chosen in great trou@@ bles , as scientists have found out by the veter@@ inary Academy of Medical School and Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also respond to the p@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the ten@@ sions of less and heavily exhau@@ sted young for the males either do not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the beginning of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ das Biology &quot; magazine in this Friday .
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie distingu@@ ishes itself with the drums of their help needy .
a total of nine adult males and eight lim@@ bs were observed from the standard arm of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a small p@@ enny of little babies that were taken for three minutes from the or@@ f@@ box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
at the other hand , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ened cookies , which were also raised in addition .
the researchers make their results despite the low sample for sa@@ wing vig@@ or@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted strongly in the terror , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned up faster to the speakers , when this sh@@ outs played the very well @-@ known k@@ itt@@ ens .
this Sk@@ ill may be born or have the sexually mature with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males did not react , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already resear@@ ched the reactions of women and men on child@@ care .
also , some studies showed that women did sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in the athlet@@ ics team .
he was closed for two time due to ro@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .

bombing error in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
in Thailand , the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was standing in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , in Friday .
they suffered strange wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again .
she planned her home travel at the beginning of September .
whether of the explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ ch , also an Austrian citizen is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in a consistent contact with local authorities , so be@@ aded .
in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in had first explo@@ ded two bombs in an excav@@ ated area .
according to the police , the police have been killed in Thailand and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch , and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again , two petrol sets went up again , a further human being killed according to the authorities .
also by Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explo@@ ded in the morning .
at Det@@ onation in the near of the popular bathing train Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a police station .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a urban workforce .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ si@@ ding principle went to air in the air before the Re@@ vier of the Coast Police .
after all the determin@@ ations of Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and at Ch@@ om@@ on at the south @-@ east coast had several injured .
it is related to explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was called Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks have the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ ic@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re assum@@ ing that they are a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early in order to express itself to possible moti@@ ves , but it is likely to take action by the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
the Thai media also wanted to recogn@@ ise a pattern in the attacks of the country , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police declared that the terrorist attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
instead it rather , that the bombs of the prev@@ ailing military j@@ unta were laid .
in the past few days , the authorities have kept confi@@ dential references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the South of the country - but they did not have been informed about the exact time and places .
still be un@@ clear that a group behind the attacks .
the police reported public officials to strengthen the security office buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge any tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace dating back to the years of Thailand , King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after all successful bombing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry for Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to make the instructions on the Thai Security Council as a result .
high security risk ( level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ c@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ on and its surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be some necessary journeys in these provinces .
high security risk ( level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution .
these spatial influences have also been in developing the military influence in the next few years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs be an attempt to raise chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had taken in 2014 after a phase bloody uph@@ e@@ aval , keeps himself up to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it has not been succeeded in developing the military , which has been in the utter@@ most south of the country for years , in the outer south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at a popular meeting point - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is advis@@ able to the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several actions , the constitu@@ ents of the Federation also have provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity &apos; Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ident@@ ity Against the Freedom Party &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ arten of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immig@@ rants or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in fighting extrem@@ ist mode .
that is why we observe the movement too .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it is turned against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ land . &quot;
constitu@@ tional@@ ity in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony , Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ as said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority I have closely voted in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group , where she says , &quot; said the constitu@@ tional@@ ity .
generally , extreme extrem@@ ists , they are an@@ gled with adol@@ escent speech , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as right homosexu@@ als .
this is not any advertising for the own thing .
the prop@@ aganda should be emotional .
young people are due in particular ways .
that is dangerous .
last year , there had been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D policies .
Ma@@ arten said that he had not in@@ sights .
the constitutional protection of this type is relevant only from certain point .
it comes to whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , which changes in extrem@@ ist , changes and extrem@@ ist extrem@@ istic .
that is crucial if such people will have influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of high @-@ speaking pen@@ alties and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ arten , he would not speak in this context , nor of new right terrorism .
but we found it in recent years that it can be legally ster@@ ile structures .
there were &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that further legally @-@ terrorism groups or small groups formed the attack against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee &apos;s or attacks in other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves .
a German @-@ wide or European control of legal ror@@ ism may not be recogni@@ z@@ able .
previous groups were created on the regional level or social networks .
however , Ma@@ arten did not worry about that many survi@@ vor@@ s went to the account of people who did not occur in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ect for attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed perpet@@ rators , who had nothing to do with right @-@ wing @-@ wing , who perhaps were polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , which however did not have radic@@ alised with right @-@ wing laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te comes to the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; not always determine the olymp@@ ic or world records at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center of the slightly out@@ varied s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer allowed to see time in TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected .
Hab@@ its was subsequently transferred to the social networks for vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
it was rather his not just an athlet@@ ic figure that moved the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ up from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ lying countries .
since in Eth@@ opia , most athletes run , Hab@@ it wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ name took the round .
some media showed him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pro@@ sper@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny to him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Freestyle , there was no role played .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL , &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i run for media attention .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea were unforgettable when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 meters of Freestyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old met only eight months before the Olympia , and had never had a long distance before the competition .

accidents - bus sliding in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ au@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
when an accident of a travel agency with 43 senior citizens were injured as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ au@@ n ( Landkreis Aur@@ i ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the construction of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their informations according to a opposite direction .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped in a atro@@ cities like an speaking speaker of the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an ambul@@ ance came to an accident on the provincial road 2 .
the in@@ sights were brought back by a liner bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ au@@ dien@@ ne district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investigations demanded the load drivers and potential witnesses to sign up in the police .
the charges per cubic metre of waste water will amount to 2,@@ 10 euros as of October 1 , 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
in case of the Az@@ endorf plant , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then be increased once again , when appropriate support measures will be necessary .
after a large calculation , the se@@ wage prize in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 Euro per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget of the budget was established by the Land@@ rat and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ages .
the market is oblig@@ ated to operate the plants in due to legal basis to operate the plants .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and the industrial enterprises from Wel@@ ech@@ es will have to take refuge in Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ uth , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Head of Herbert Schmidt on the board , a re @-@ cal@@ ulation of the fees for se@@ wage plants was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there will be also obes@@ ity and covers from previous calendar period .
the degree of serious activ@@ ating increases so that there are relatively small establishments with a very low water san@@ itation , which is between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
as a result , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be engraved .
in addition , wast@@ ew@@ ater is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calendar period , in all three plants were not least incur@@ red in a considerable extent due to their age and repair applications .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ cel@@ es , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , Lin@@ den@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ew@@ ater system , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the pump@@ ed plant pupp@@ et , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to over@@ taken care of the ground and had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation of the first pl@@ ough@@ s , the se@@ wage sl@@ ud@@ ge provides an additional ventil@@ ating option to keep the water@@ legal regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenditure , the continuing education and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were clearly below the current level of the previous year in 2011 / 2012 .
Stein@@ häuser clearly made its expend@@ itures for the operation and maintenance &quot; in the three plants . &quot;
in this manner , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in se@@ wer@@ age plants had been spar@@ ed spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain further , especially since you can not extend the supply area of the san@@ itation group Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to be extended by these systems because it concerns de@@ struc@@ tive .

when this week some us@@ ers hit a filter , which gave them tw@@ inkl@@ es , false teeth and recorded che@@ eks , some critics named a rac@@ ist cartoon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish . &quot;
they asked if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y had a larger problem to prevent the company with diversity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat , it would have had the feature de@@ activated .
the company offered a debt : the filter was an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but exter@@ n@@ ally , the rac@@ is@@ os@@ us experienced , remin@@ ded the filters of infr@@ ing@@ ing cl@@ ashes .
other contra@@ cted the An@@ ime comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose information became widely distributed over the photos , that the filter is inj@@ ected and was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter @-@ setting of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not le@@ ak @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ low@@ ish was removed .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that threatened these cultural proud dra@@ stically .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ eness and integration policy , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we are all in their hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - those in the race of race several than their older counter @-@ players - could more likely to expect to be eligible for Sen@@ si@@ vity .
if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult to show that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and ur@@ ged others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a telephone interview they said they believe that road @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y has a lack of di@@ vers@@ eness in Snap@@ chat with Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leaders , finishing her record with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ight Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either , they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their employees so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who are working there , but not in positions in which they &apos;re safe or feel as well as to say . &quot;
other parts your opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has dropped largely un@@ answered .
the company has not published any numbers for the sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , they refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently maintained a personnel responsible , focusing on population groups and on internal integ@@ rating environments .
Zh@@ u said that she is closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask me if they need more users such as us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership for@@ gery IS@@ IS Secret Services , outlines the Congress of Congress
at the United States Central Command , United States Central Command and changed our detailed information to describe an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can Commun@@ ism , declared by major dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Intelligence Agen@@ cies , reported how pre @-@ established its estim@@ ations regarding the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Service Information , which were typically picked up by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , were regularly allowed by the American efforts towards terrorism , as the actual states of other news services , &quot; quoted newspaper article published the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , &quot; &quot; &quot;
gui@@ ding error in Cent@@ Com is enough to reach the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct remarks that government peaks under Obama instructions given to change the reports , as an@@ alysts were subjected to the pressure of their pre @-@ laws , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l , too .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements prior to Congress were clearly positive than the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com Speci@@ alist was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Republi@@ can from Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the peak of Central Command offers the latest reports to run the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after which was added that an@@ alysts had become wor@@ ried about the man@@ ipulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday is completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com Reports by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
the National Services Committee published its own findings on Thursday , which accounts with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com developed an over@@ ly limited process for creating news coverage regarding I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi safety services , &quot; gave the highest prime dem@@ ok@@ rat , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of re@@ conn@@ aissance reports , &quot; ur@@ rec@@ ated the mor@@ ally under an@@ alysts and &apos; handed over little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave up no evidence to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts &apos; as regards a &quot; designated political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was released on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; on Tuesday .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon &apos;s general spec@@ trometer , based on complaints of Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , announced that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the convention during the investigation of the general spec@@ ulative report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts could definitely have di@@ verg@@ ating opinions concerning interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ations@@ over the question of successful air@@ campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that in the meantime is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , rejected the question of President Obama to the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of decl@@ ining information about the Islamic State was remin@@ is@@ cent of dis@@ agreements more than ten years ago , as Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written part of the recommendations of many an@@ alysts , and a little time on the wall to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led to Mr. Hoo@@ ker on indication of government agencies , that contrary to the government &apos;s government proposals , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because this provis@@ ionally refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field of hockey , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 seal over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember to have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place , which stay after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet next round in the last match of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two will get in each group of six teams in each of the first and second place .
the first @-@ place finish will lead to the strong Dutch , somewhat longer from the way that lead the other group .
as always the game can go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host of their success story , four years after the last London Games have landed on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania while she had a hockey ra@@ cket in their hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became the national champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 when it was unable to qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team passed away everything .
in the subsequent year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus began to make things better .
&quot; a cultural change , an incre@@ mental change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the job @-@ job in London , which we have now .
we can rip off the ru@@ in .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed un@@ tough and kept the playing time from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter till B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it carried out a Sprint with the flat ball about the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ beat the ball in the gate to pro@@ cure the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez was the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the goal of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to make a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
like b@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the heart of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are too late as it is too late for the Olympic Games too .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and un@@ trained , a rapid relay for competition and stre@@ w@@ ns .
it is like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is provided by the wrist@@ watch to the Turner at the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to TV , a newspaper read or listen to your neigh@@ bors in the waiting long in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ut@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are log@@ an do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples , could have definitely be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ ancy .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not lit any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow , the sports that are not generally acknowledged : air guns , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest , and may reign for long .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me get the attention of the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines had already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was anno@@ ying that many of whom I had asked , did not know that it is at all .
this could also be regional Ig@@ il@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes competing for competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are invited to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian , to divide the women to the women .
Dong Dong in China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ines ski@@ p a certain exterior char@@ me , in part because it sounds for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ ard that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never too excited calls - but also the Gra@@ z@@ ie of the Turn@@ ens and Di@@ ves that combines two sports .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish @-@ bo@@ under @-@ trampoline , which means a lot like &quot; jumps . &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , h@@ real and salad ) before they landing at the feet .
they are evaluated according to the official programme , difficulty , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
officers from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
medal hop@@ ing must go beyond gold for gold , faster , upward , and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , to the top and down@@ wards on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast , another one @-@ known objective : the world or Olympic champion .
the goal oriented stre@@ b is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer .
but it &apos;s the thing that I own even while watching these games as a little effort .
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she super@@ vised , seem@@ ingly heavy he@@ avi@@ os like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , go down , then down , then back up again .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final round of the women will be held in Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to see in general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness of consciousness can only be reached by the attack@@ ing and the object of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air round off to the air in the morning .
&quot; a generation protest &quot; in Ethiopia , Long to become part of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting at the government &apos;s resistance .
witnesses say that eigh@@ ty protest@@ ing during cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia straight together now ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid construction of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government afflicted the country and far more territories .
last week , thousands of people hit the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was un@@ bar@@ red according to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen had shot down armed protest@@ ers and killed .
in the movement , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety merchants young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to assemble this country and yet it will even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence service collabor@@ ates closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
C@@ ush &apos;s economy grew in a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted to silence what dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or put into the wake of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you under@@ press people and these no other options have nothing to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m T@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation Protestant .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the soil to the wor@@ shipping in terms of power of the reg@@ ained coalition .
after a further critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and therefore control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the st@@ resses go along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line , in June hundreds of lives .
Analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who in the last years more or less than were forced to eng@@ age , and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years of survival have now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the past few years , many Ethiop@@ ian workers were able to communicate through the social media because cheaper smartphones and more frequently were improved and improved by Internet services .
even if the government shut access to Facebook and Twitter , whatever they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still communicate over the Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that they keep up .
several young Ethiop@@ ian showed that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest Eth@@ nic in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since Equ@@ ations pro@@ sper@@ ated the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia , predominantly of Christian bre@@ aches , in the politics and the economy , while the Oro@@ mos took off , of which many Muslims are living and live in Flach@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are involved in coordination with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests were in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is domin@@ ating un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , in the secret services , politics and politics .
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
in 2012 , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ claim leader , was forced to death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years , with Ethiopia , prime minister .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that it was particularly compens@@ ated in that , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special assigned to work opponents and to make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this basic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians , Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ significant reasons to take the status of Mr Mel@@ es .
An@@ other as Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , is Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South .
analy@@ tics say that he did not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ers controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had one such ri@@ ots had experienced in 2005 after thousands against elections , according to the information of analy@@ tics , the government failed and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many protest@@ ers were killed , even though there were less than in the last months , and that period of distur@@ ban@@ ces were relatively spe@@ eded .
based on Ethiopia , Ethiopia , leaders for their visionary infrastructure plan , as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this has not been the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ n@@ ical form .
last month a protest in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , headed by Tig@@ ray , and the hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray is always experienced in the social media .
analy@@ tics say that the protests inher@@ ited the United States and other Western allies into a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently ha@@ sted that it was closed on the basis .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to assemble its ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama ( IS@@ IS ) was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m &quot; was founded .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y , who turns his campaign by repe@@ ating his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; fo@@ unders &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions on the communications between the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clear and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ soldier , who ende@@ av@@ our to take him in an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain away statements , which he could not say .
after he had made the clari@@ fication on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the asser@@ tion of Thursday and existed in interviews , that he really had not inten@@ tional , the president and Mrs. Clinton used IS@@ IS .
but in a early morning in Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply sto@@ cky .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump has said in a series of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ations entirely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to sm@@ ash the testimony by saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate would not know about it .
the last storm of criticism is down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign for fail@@ ing effects on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held words for economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject .
on Twitter , it war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ os would result in force to higher taxes , and that he was bor@@ ing out of their speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken her defense to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved to himself when he meant that the Russians should make Mrs. Clin@@ t Ema@@ ils , but he later declared &quot; Natural , &quot; I said the sar@@ ist . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the spe@@ ech@@ es borders in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages of his fans are taken , as they arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who are observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe it is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements enough to be interpreted so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received a still prot@@ ector , because his conversion has gone continued .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the Federal States North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to exc@@ use his pro@@ voc@@ alist appearance , he charged his critics frequently to understand his testimonies or his hum@@ or false .
but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his loy@@ al co @-@ stri@@ des brought into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ ok@@ ant would like to be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent inter@@ c@@ ists , was to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said that he was inter@@ ro@@ gated by Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama named IS@@ IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ b@@ än@@ kler , entirely wrong and therefore it happened because he left the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to ar@@ gue that the government had served as an outdoor minist@@ Minister to spread it to IS@@ IS , to spread out the situation in the Middle East , under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued its attacks on the media and threw their attacks against them on each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats don@@ ates to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use only one more proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once ti@@ ci@@ ded over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
b Cafe was a first cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay only cash , that &apos;s no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was displaced .
the shop So@@ ap ch@@ ery , put in summer 2014 , sells soap to Cup@@ cakes .
indi@@ genes , there were injured as the last loss in an anti @-@ gent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ating city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is alter@@ ation but I can not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , except the Chelsea hotel and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is alter@@ ation , it is also inv@@ alid .
a restored ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began work in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to prepare money for a new site , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the b@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ ome machinery model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would have experim@@ enting himself .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , Sand@@ wi@@ ches are spread out with bac@@ on and cheese and s@@ aut@@ é onions as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are natural ambi@@ ence .
the café is not served beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ ained power to old customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through William@@ sburg from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .

the de@@ pri@@ ming meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , just after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt was a F@@ ai@@ ble for elabor@@ ate delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue , like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water &apos;s tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pr@@ au@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the elderly people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was published by the Chinese cuisine in the USA during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building in Lower East Side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; An an independent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they presented culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop . together with a repor@@ ter at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
bricks , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive trees while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables eat .
when the repor@@ ter ordered min@@ ced , this was appropriate for a discussion about the meal in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from a ingredient , and some cheaper , which stretches out the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have put on the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of Women boiling for male field workers and fresh b@@ aked past@@ el served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
they were the Americans that sent food to an hung@@ red Europeans during the first World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the way to which the country went so to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when the Americans was a central , donated theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ te was the same model : mysterious dishes such as bread and cass@@ ettes into stap@@ le food , the c@@ asserole dish as &quot; wonderful kind , essence re@@ lics recovered , &quot; noted bricks , since coo@@ ks could hide unt@@ ou@@ bt@@ ful ingredients under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry matter .
meat , for years the centre of the American cuisine was , became a rarely ser@@ vi@@ able luxury .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally mixed mixtures were tried to test as a low @-@ cal@@ ori@@ ous and nutr@@ itious satisfaction in front of taste or even healthy household stuff .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , a court prepared a court of this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no more popular on noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
butter and b@@ aked onions don &apos;t match each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
like never before or ever since , the bud@@ get@@ ary management - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the essence of the country .
by pressing the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ ages women to become &quot; budget spi@@ ders &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals , just to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic d@@ ain@@ ties .
in particular , reports on the answer of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ded L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude .
while he praised the simple I@@ owa farm house of his kitchen , he has grown like the billi@@ on@@ ely man of world to whom he has become .
&quot; he mo@@ cked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded meal @-@ room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful real@@ ise .
President Roosevelt might have had the same error if not his wife &apos;s Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to equi@@ p his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the an@@ cho@@ res of a house@@ keeper with no interest in taste compounds conducted by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House produced the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also prepared one of the most controversi@@ al food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected when the country came back onto the legs .
during our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair gave better understood by writing the ess@@ hab@@ its of brick @-@ in @-@ law in law - for example , how they could not dis@@ card food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really got sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a storm of rain .
after the plate at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were evacu@@ ated , they pulled down a dessert which she had prepared at home : the pr@@ au@@ car@@ ess , which he ate Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick that was to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

in Bom@@ b Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he appointed his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the lives of their lives .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a fac@@ ial attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil group that has so far saved the lives of nearly 60,000 humans .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life into the game to pull people out of their bom@@ bed houses and to aff@@ ord the first aid of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue plan of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the g@@ lowing symbol in the thro@@ at of war .
but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die for my life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar itself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ oc@@ op@@ ters have been dis@@ car@@ ded over the Alz@@ ette district , which was filled with chlor@@ inated gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the remains of the bomb , that no children are playing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bombs of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship &apos;s research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland was only sold after 150 years of yo@@ ungst@@ ers .
on the ground of the northern Atlantic coast , in an hour he comes in an hour an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes up , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and is almost as fast as a Rob@@ be with this top speed .
that was characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , but seems to be a cylinder position for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any point of Greenland , which could be 392 years of age .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock , which means that this life expectancy for verteb@@ rates a world record .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long that Greenland will be st@@ aging .
only the evidence was .
Greenland ha@@ w@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer the water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they dive in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s Greenland lifestyle .
her time l@@ up@@ un@@ emp@@ o lim@@ bs them when they took six animals with a transmitter .
they nevertheless make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had ar@@ ous@@ ed the jaw of a young iron .
maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver , that sw@@ ings out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , Fis@@ her@@ men , between 2010 and 2013 , in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 is cm size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already built before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic tests are larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centi@@ metres in length , the lens @-@ core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 due to nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland hair@@ y had normal Carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was actually shown for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metres of Greenland , an age of 335 years , while the record of Hai with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ birds only grew after @-@ up , when they are longer than four metres , was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age .
as one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be reached on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries .
and this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in iron waters , is no co@@ incidence .
even the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on pointed tip , was caught on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organ@@ ism from there live animals living on savings banks .
they turn later - and al@@ igh@@ ters slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to which the animal is swal@@ low .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on how many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; says the Evol@@ u@@ tion@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life .
construction in double pack
with themes around building , the community at the youngest meeting is mainly explo@@ ited .
with a relief , the committee took a Communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently given residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the land of land , par@@ cel@@ or@@ atory and re@@ mot@@ ions could be clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on measurement , the sale of plots in residential areas &quot; Street &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area binder 1 ) could not be interested in interest .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main was therefore competing in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the best chances to put out work@@ places and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence environment Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is impossible to allow money to operate from financial transactions within the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass the approval in Britain is far enough .
that only use major US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs , jobs .
lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; will be bil@@ led with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Management ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have completed its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the sheet bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
indeed , Luxembourg houses a large fund sector , cutting edge , as well as Dublin and infrastructure .
Frankfurt am significantly easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
furthermore the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it wasn &apos;t easy to find free high @-@ quality offices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rental prices for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer the city stand at No. 7 in Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ference is : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt may attract other banks and investors . &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it vote .
for this even the forces involved : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the federal government
Hill@@ ary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 , this resulted for the presidential election of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the presidential elections .
in 2015 , Clin@@ ique USD 1 million donated to charity projects , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in spe@@ ech@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister , issued a income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind the incorrect expres@@ sions and return to his previous promises to publish his instrum@@ entation .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax inspection through the tax authorities as the reason for its ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s elec@@ toral fight in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential election of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what has committed any other presidential candidate over the past decades and his tax returns to publish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump had not been paid during the 1990s for two years , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Federal Government has become one topic in election campaign .
Clinton supports a control which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that would ensure people who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .

Jewish Director at Berliner Hotel in Berlin , since Israeli pres@@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation to Berlin - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots compiled a media watch , having betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , where there had been no Israeli election in Berlin since the Arab guests had requested a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ en@@ entation &quot; Shoah &quot; sent his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list box list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s capital , elim@@ in@@ ates that Israel eliminated and eliminated ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a possibility to select Israel via an own call center .
based on an explanation , the director returned to the hotel reception area .
the answer , which he received , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; like Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel set out that the measure had a clear decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , le@@ aded the director even more rage .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix was cleared , &quot; the staff of Lanz@@ mann quotes .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ wo @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and was over@@ thrown .
that is really highly ac@@ em@@ ailed .
the fact that this is allocated in Germany in exactly these hotel chain is even a larger dis@@ grace .
the need no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people knew the whole a sc@@ and@@ al .
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been a con@@ sign@@ age of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ aming to you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was noted in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is situated on the no@@ bles Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all the alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ an &quot; for Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror .
&quot; there was never a direct directive &quot; to record Israel in the quick list box , &quot; quoted from the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds to the country code now added .

students drove on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police together when they were gathered to demonstrate against the re@@ forms of the government for public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and Gum@@ mig@@ uel to the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began , as police officers attempted to inter@@ sec@@ t the students , which led to the police , rubber handles and dr@@ um@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their taxation of the plans .
according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300.000 students will be converted to save money .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
with the repe@@ al of the sanctions imposed by the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , who grew up by 7@@ 0.9 percent between Moscow and Teheran in the year @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions were abolished in Iran , the interest in pages of Russian companies increased heavily in the country , the ambassador .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to have access to the market .
of course , the further trading expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran remained in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade swing was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Irish tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , the Russian foreign companies represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as well as the tourist settlement in Russia .
you could say that the record figures will be broken in Russia from last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ ds to Pfor@@ z@@ iness of Charity
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch &apos;s Church were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were handled .
around the time until the next Rom@@ antic voyage of all ministers in the past two years , the upper chamber of St. Anna decided to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different Pil@@ gri@@ mage was examined and they finally decided for the Bish@@ ops of Fri@@ bourg , where in this year the anniversary of Mer@@ cy was rendered with an opened gate of the Freiburg Mu@@ enster , a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Car@@ lo@@ oms spread themselves on the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration of St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ ots and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point in Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster &apos;s wife is also born and so the pilgrimage of Münster was driven out of Münster .
the individual day tours were shot in the morning and in the evening by a short im@@ pulse with different prayers , songs and fonts .
but on the way , the Min@@ is went on field@@ gun , chap@@ els or churches and again to sing together a song from the pilgrims to sing together .
for the nights there were a parish church on the local parish .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller also served for a tasty work as well as the evening meal and breakfast .
on the second day there went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
tags on the stage went to St. Peter , who had the exhau@@ sting distance , had to be dropped at the same time , at first , at first , approximately 500 altitude metres and then resum@@ ed .
the rewarded reward was a common gr@@ illing at the evening on the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing convent church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage of Freiburg .
in the late afternoon , the Min@@ is met in the afternoon at the Freiburg Mu@@ enster and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small im@@ pulse , God was ab@@ dic@@ ated here .
Min@@ is was greeted by Ko@@ h Markus O@@ bert in the evening Mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims could see the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar .
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon it went back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong congreg@@ ational experience were left .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms into the house when Br@@ ite Gold caught for cycling opportunities
the Scottish team in Rio to fame , in Scotland , Call@@ eman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner on the last night in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , in Rio to boast , as the British team ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow increased the anchor of Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who broke his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the j@@ acks and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to home a win of the favorites new Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick , after it takes just a modest sixth place in March , despite the Ho@@ ys World Championships in London .
the problem of Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ ring a gap created by K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the sc@@ ots that now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ ts , Kenn@@ y - the winner four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic champion , but won the New Zealand round the New Zealand for the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , barely returned , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and the Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a great part of transformation , in the execution in a higher gear in order to slow him to slow down and to keep it and above all scor@@ ners to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a dirty comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
in the final round , we mounted an Olympic champion and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there are no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave a weak start to the rail after a weak start .
he moved this statement later and there was no depos@@ iting of England Ri@@ vals .
for such a superior victory there was no problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels complete with all the GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined the last three months as a team .
we &apos;re in such a lot of world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London .
if that a barometer of our progress has been in the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated the win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve R@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese made by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat , to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two gold medals , he should be defeated to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there was a good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dy W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ner Dou@@ ill quali@@ fier with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 on the target .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest , where the Lon@@ gri@@ dge is foc@@ uss@@ ed on security .
he fought yesterday with applic@@ ants in front of the qualification , when they had called the officials to be called to measure his height .
in the respective women competition , which continued until tomorrow and finished , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team will rely on his powerful railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a band to medals .
based on a truly extraordinary representation of absolute Domin@@ anz in Beijing and London the expectations were run@@ off for Rio .
we played a drama in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex and fashion designs as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
but if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks much later than the legendary name GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of work - are on the game since the plant operators are termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , so that all delivery contracts opened , as the remote energy company will over@@ took .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to use the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 work stations in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Port@@ land are on the game .
no fewer than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of a closure .
in addition , it could happen to Domin@@ ic effects , since the sm@@ el@@ ter consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point of Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Port@@ land loses weight and ris@@ ed a closing time .
this stage follows the lon@@ gl@@ ass@@ y spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price of the plant .
AG@@ L that the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ ance with his Lo@@ y Yang A Power Plant in Lat@@ robe Valley distributed that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p represent smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to run , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting , &quot; the company divided by .
AG@@ L will continue to be the so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; that should have been in force since November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts for the financial year 17 may contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong sales markets for large retail prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of contracts in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; Exp@@ enses of a Termin@@ ation &quot; .
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; Ability to operate Al@@ co@@ as ... or ensure the power supply to the melting , &quot; not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that it had finished a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have been in force by November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has been re@@ signed by the contract .
analy@@ tics of the industry in front of the possible storage conditions in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements from the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ awatt hours of electricity every year .
if both plants disappear from the market , would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth subsidiary of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ade Cl@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ al issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York arrived on Thursday , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers was followed by a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ lo@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family and producers of Ke@@ eping up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she finished the cover of her sister and ends with a classic return : they all have a surprise work .
this is the cl@@ ish@@ ee@@ ated hands for almost any birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ claim brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to be able to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Car@@ path@@ hi@@ an began with safety .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue Cover is going to be beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September edition is for Vog@@ ue the most advanced edition of the year .
with a circumference , rather similar to a photo tape when a fashion magazine resem@@ bles a large number of advertising labels ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista used by the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 615 @-@ page advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ stum@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive , that in the past two years , the magazine appeared before the official announcement in front of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were definitely more &quot; celebr@@ ities , that &quot; as &quot; models that are famous are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ ani and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ acher J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga the honour had honor .
but even with the minor chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break model &quot; of its generation - below the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to fam@@ ed persons or reality Stars or yo@@ ungst@@ ers today , who know how to shoot a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is in@@ advert@@ ised ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career in Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to each other .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always an@@ gled in the fashion world .
in June critic@@ ized Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings of sal@@ ted boiling again when the news came with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but at the mis@@ sil@@ ut seemed to be pre@@ vent@@ ured at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is the true sense of the word a super@@ structure .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your plan of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell you on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
you are sold by her noticed pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds subsidiary to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time it is visible to the reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
annually , municipal districts have 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 votes from the country are exp@@ elled by the local government annually , while the industry accounts for the effects of other middle @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly elderly people , immig@@ rants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar products - are rejected on free legal services and legal services .
legal services to the municipality , which are already rented out , are ready for further cuts .
starting in June of the next year , these legal centres will lose a further 30 percent of its Federal agents .
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal Cent@@ res showed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Municipal Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically unified , which means thousands of people of major services that you need to be dismissed , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and afflicted debt , families that were dismissed by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have trouble @-@ specific species and this survey shows that they could not get the help you need .
the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of hil@@ s@@ needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems without any assistance .
we call for the Federal Minister of Justice and Federal Minister of the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , so that people who need help to maintain them with legal problems .
in the last year the state government had to raise funds for legal aids to national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the city centres and their customer community , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

while the red @-@ black government coalition , which could further reign in the north , it is not possible after the reconstruction industry in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have so good chances to continue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in Time l@@ upe : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the success@@ ors now domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a lot and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather t@@ apping .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight meg@@ abytes , which would now be enough for about two suit@@ ability with high resolution .
an iPhone is now available with a minimum of 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator , &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the stores and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros you can buy the devices even on the internet , but they &apos;re somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; Office in the West African format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax , the Communic@@ ator could be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , if too slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then there were a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was rather pro@@ ud@@ ly : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015 .
nobody could do in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything is different since .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled at Microsoft .
the market today rule over the market , which came to all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s today for a lot of people everyday .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion units have been sold , by Samsung and Apple alone , alone , 555 million units .
the global turnover of the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ current business provider of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ation accounts are coming .
around the Smartphone , all of the industry has grown .
the decisive breakthrough towards the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs in the Mac world began introducing the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet wireless , easy to use by touch screen .
the winner of Apple started today , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market .
finally , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has finally fighting .
the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ understanding of 20 years after the invention .
on average , every German today sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to push the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only to bring in our local commun@@ es and in the whole of London , but in the whole country , renew@@ ing pro@@ sper@@ ity and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , this is the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as we were in London in 2012 when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come again by creating new possibilities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices , some 40,000 new jobs and a youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and we will be able to bl@@ am@@ aze us at the world stage .
the bi@@ fl@@ es were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to survive , but He@@ ath@@ row answers to any questions asked .
like the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in quite GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has earned a £ 11 billion valuable infrastructure programme in time and budget , from the T5 - which was elected five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies test drives of the world .
now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row as well as to ensure future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; Cat and mouse game &quot; regarding display block
for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block@@ ades , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ play . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the ad block@@ ades on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ od@@ al , in which user could upgrade their filters in the program to block rest@@ art@@ ing advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook has announced that his desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising , to identify which is the advertisement that is part of advertising is to be avoided .
but Ad@@ block told that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ od@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the show @-@ loos@@ ening Open Source Community and the modifications have already been possible since the invention of sco@@ ot@@ ting players in the g@@ ange , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media in the fight is a powerful indi@@ z for the industry .
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are lo@@ cur@@ ated , nearly four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users active on Facebook , which access their mobile devices to Facebook , makes Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the accounts recei@@ v@@ ables .
the company has optimized for display windows on desktop computers because mobile ad block does not have any effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , the spokes@@ person .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient great share of income so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile to be worthwhile as worth reading .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be &quot; ad &quot; in@@ ference tool &quot; to upgrade to people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just sends new filters to block it , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user does not constitute a positive experience , we are planning to address the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ person for Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b average , which is why we have concentrated on the development tools such as ad pre@@ ferences to lay more control into the hands of the people .
woman with thought suicide on Swiss motorway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witness , after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday arrived in a thought suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 close to Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman put in the Dun@@ kl@@ es &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; at the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , was wanted to kill themselves .
she died before the place .
several drivers have already been picked , but some have not been identified , the police said these as well as every voucher of the incident to report themselves .
it opened an investigation into an investigation , which is a logical step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something what the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases have been shown in the last five years that the drivers are not withdrawn into responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ es on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to go out in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of the cas@@ ual killing , after having left a man and had killed one night at the A1 in the near of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and was un@@ conscious in the streets , took the court .
the Court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- which had responded to a emergency call -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; entirely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Judge .
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should noti@@ fies the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Change : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past the Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with their hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could have been recorded out similar conditions .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their tight atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , similar atmosphere , and still slowly move slowly .
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet , probably accounted for more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to cover life and protect themselves before faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Models simulation , the slow rotation of Venus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Venus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained for almost two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produced rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that works like a rain@@ bow to sc@@ ute the surface from a large majority of the sun heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously suspected of planet surveys .
even though they were probably hab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years , --@@ encour@@ ages heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans are evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect - the Venus , who like we know them today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus Climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy come back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back to Colorado on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado River and led to a certain extent to the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years , I have been managing my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , Colorado River , with energy , passion and authenti@@ city , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy op@@ ted in a position .
I have thought in the course of the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth and to give it a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be matched to the organization .
he must also have a determination in all decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had been tax@@ ed on 23 May 2013 , op@@ pressed with him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Z@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy , during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 , he won the best coach of the league during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the association at 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild spot in the Western Conference around five points .
when Hall of Fame was won by Roy four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ ö@@ Declaration join talks , set a strike out of
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers are exposed to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while all disp@@ utes set up at the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group performed spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to begin the process of current streaming process , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks , starting the next next year to rest@@ rain the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , protest against possible wage sub@@ missions of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has reduced rates to its counter@@ f@@ ishers in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent decline to on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to come across the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for his part of thousands of people and plans , to spend his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries since its activities were rati@@ onal@@ ised as a result of his mega @-@ expansion BG Group .
energy companies are subject to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that caused by the ruling of the British in June to rein@@ force the European Union .
in the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament Dave Anderson met this week with workers &quot; leaders in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we will need a business that works for many , not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rotation speed of stars in the star@@ z@@ ap of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest Mission with the Kepler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers helped to gather the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star@@ ing Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star@@ ry loops in different inst@@ al@@ ments as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods of planets are standing .
&quot; we hope that we experienced by the same one of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , to the age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ z@@ ap of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation originated approximately 125 million years ago now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you now turn right now .
at top rotating gu@@ esses , these m@@ stri@@ ches meet large amounts of star@@ ches .
because this winch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rot@@ ational speed begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every day by recogni@@ zing the time between the release of an recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- like s@@ ooth@@ ills -- .
the latest catalogue of rotary rates indicates that massive star more than less massive floors than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ ei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors to be more massive , while against faster rot@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ voy of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal laboratory to compare primary qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ z@@ ap of Pl@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
it &apos;s still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , when , when and why stars their rotation rates will slow down their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades which soon will be published in the astronom@@ ical journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball star turn off
tears ran to Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
following his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional winner will be on 12th August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the trial of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ship .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star game participants of Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ an .
his signature among a tenth year @-@ year contract granted him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast on December 31 , 2017 , he served as an advisor and youth coach - with a full content .
as a player paid Rodri@@ guez worth a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas rank@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to run some mil@@ estones .
the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two other bas@@ eball player found in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old has not yet been recorded in the glory hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ ar .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - Spitz@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al his appearance is outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star presented the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 ster@@ oids have been taken into existence .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main susp@@ ect for years to have an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida high @-@ performance funding .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I played a break of 20 years without break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its f@@ arewell day will not fail sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball alloys in their last games have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job includes no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Du@@ c@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the ratios with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson has been said to be sympath@@ y with the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ val@@ en Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want to use a @-@ Rod with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping cases
caught : due to a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , Wei@@ ght@@ lifting Adrian has not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are transfer@@ ed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
an athl@@ ete athl@@ ete should have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ falls the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro were known .
the Chinese swimming pool Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter ste@@ ep@@ le ch@@ ie@@ fly in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish poems became positi@@ vely tested in Brazil - immediately before the start of the athlet@@ ic light athlet@@ ics cont@@ ests come this news on time .
in Ch@@ en it had been demonstrated last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de that is used as a m@@ asked means for D@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ section .
the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their expul@@ sion by the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only ten seconds missed it the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to attend the prec@@ urs@@ ing over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; we will co@@ operate with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history is the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ itation of sports@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio abandoned the news about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was innocent , &quot; the only statement could be food supplements , &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics .
according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance around blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporary suspended , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial is supposed to have been positive .
by Bulg@@ arians , Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow registered with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right loop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , for example , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ load@@ able nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier than the an@@ ab@@ oli@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both compete for in@@ gest@@ ion , but may not launch in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association introduced the entire Russian team until except for systematic D@@ op@@ ings the start , too , too , produces many bad news in Rio .
in the swim sports , the former insur@@ ances in China had ensured even more violent disp@@ utes between athletes .
thus Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ ed@@ t touched the Chinese Olympic Sun Y@@ y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ ed@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was in the centre of a con@@ front@@ ation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping control , &quot; said this .
sun was positi@@ vely tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker her rans@@ om
programmer by erotic malware . currently , targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of malware @-@ def@@ ences , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , United Kingdom and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of a attack with comp@@ ress@@ er software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already generating a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware path@@ way .
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rator drawn by the perpet@@ rators , in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their ex@@ pressing software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential feed money is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching quick evolution of the malware software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the col@@ oring programs have been designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the perpet@@ rator software for themselves .
only private use were the aim , but the change to company att@@ els were out@@ stretched in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once in the computer of a victim , it seeks specifically for un@@ long changing files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
then the software will present the requirements of the comp@@ ress@@ er .
to get the final key code to the files , the victim need money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ne Bit@@ coin .
however , where with private use the personal photo database on the game is , it works for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the loss falls off when a cen@@ time is added .
22 percent of the affected German firms registered sales loss by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business activities completely , in case of a case .
in Germany , several hospitals already were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of acute disease .
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you can only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to re@@ ject the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators , in view of stand@@ still .
the chi@@ pper turn to know and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety for@@ gers of F @-@ Secure explo@@ res the user surface and get to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free @-@ to @-@ accessible support sites or un@@ dec@@ ryp@@ t for example files .
and private people after payments of a few hundred Euros will have to pay companies part hard negoti@@ ation and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ dec@@ ryp@@ t .
given the potentially high and relatively risk winn@@ ings from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware Er@@ press@@ ation , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains safety sex@@ es Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the antivirus vend@@ or SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write an om@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely it is that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their cont@@ ing@@ software then in the form of a software building box to the actual press operators .
the existing malware kits were created by providing malware , advise and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; delivery includes an adap@@ table tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the comp@@ ress@@ ors are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to distribute the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
you can log into one of the for@@ ums in the underground , buy the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per registered computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crimin@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ iny with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data .
over 50 percent of the IT @-@ IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte @-@ survey rely on to retri@@ eve R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scan software .
the perpet@@ rators have already been pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient thre@@ ats for successful path@@ ology more , thre@@ aten the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as some customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential of any kind of data even so much higher than before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things .
the Security Conference Def@@ con demonstrate security for@@ gers as they were able to receive control with the Internet linked thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the sec@@ tioning of a kind of block@@ aded system could definitely be a rans@@ om value .
if the perpet@@ rators have then to block a factory in a factory instead of heating in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a topic of Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and flexible working
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to put everything : a little SUV , a little Coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty re@@ load , but the HR V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually flexible in everyday life as a deci@@ de@@ dly flexible .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , and there &apos;s no place close to any place .
the materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortably , only the cockpit of the inside falls off there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
it is not only a trunk trunk of 453 l at the same time and 10@@ 26 l under hing@@ ed back @-@ backs , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bench can be valves and provide the storage space that is high from the floor to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space is slightly loaded , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to teach his work somewhat more quiet .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine of engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
it is set to be a bit direct .
the equipment available in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; is nothing to be desired .
the City emergency braking system is part of the security systems ( operates till temp@@ o 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the micro@@ set@@ ti@@ an assistant .
sometimes , the coll@@ isions were sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes because he has been rated as &quot; wander@@ ing objects . &quot;
very reliable , the remote control system works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respond to traffic sign recognition and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI connector located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ equipped gasoline @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much will the petrol engine will get from 20000 Euro , the diesel is starting from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday use car .
Airline does not stick : crash on aviation power
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) is a liability for liability in d@@ angers which are typical for air traffic .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken up at the fall of a kne@@ e gra@@ b .
the accident would have had anywhere , however - it handles a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the organis@@ er
after their journey , after their journey only money back then , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was severely beaten in di@@ arr@@ he@@ a on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ eness and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ists back to a def@@ ective folding situation , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that had been a man@@ oeu@@ vre and def@@ aul@@ ted against the promot@@ er .
before the court , the claim@@ ers had no success .
in fact , the situation was faul@@ ty .
but the organizer was just short before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the verdict .
especially during the samples of the water , no contamination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ less among others - belonged to the general living risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mai@@ zi@@ ère told the violence of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , in July , many people were wor@@ ried about other attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and decided to react to terror at the same time .
certainly is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
we will not succeed this triumph with the terror@@ ists .
if criminal off@@ ences would have to leave the country , the height above the security and strength of the population will also apply to the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement a proposal by the European Parliament election until 2017 .
he announced also a further management rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ sized orders over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism must be returned under punishment .
video surveillance needs to be improved that ce@@ ase@@ fire may be as amended , especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is used .
the very much @-@ discussed swe@@ at light for doctors should remain according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical conditions , he wants to search for solutions how to reduce the haz@@ ard of the citizens , he said with a look at the psych@@ ic di@@ lig@@ ations .
in order to meet a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary .
teachers would have to be prepared better in dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
to the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning an investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that concern safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister is clearly pronounced against action .
&quot; this was a thor@@ ough for the hin@@ ge in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe in the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality .
a gen@@ eric prohibition of complet@@ eness to be justified with constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t forget everything you re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
you could talk about rules for road traffic or witnesses in court .

better traffic flow on the motorway
there are regularly on the ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legislation has to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in the professional traffic on the surrounding road every night when they ride over the highway via Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction company extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the direction of Wes@@ eler Road is one lane gauge 700 meters .
drive then directly from the hammer to the right .
the big advantage : traffic spl@@ its itself early , making the total occurr@@ ence on a long @-@ driven section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is very nerv@@ ous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return trip dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way , and sometimes also beyond .
this is why the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 is shortly before the direction of Wes@@ eler Road .
from here traffic can only pass a track on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back over thirty @-@ four@@ ths of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had found that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to absorb the heavy duty of the heavy duty .
how long the bott@@ len@@ eck and the temporary inj@@ un@@ cture has lasted , the responsible state can not say .
however , at years of age : for the bridge has an official trading period of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislation of the legislation has been deliber@@ ately chosen for the transport time in the school holidays , because they are to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
the traffic will be run on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

rain instead of shooting : hope on weather progress
the weather made the d@@ wind@@ ling Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stake in the night - but there are hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain so that the heavenly spect@@ acle was observed , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ cent , which include 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star d@@ olls .
they have their names , because they seem to be apparent from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us which is in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for ins@@ om@@ nia
in the evening we will roll off for ever , at night there is hour for hours in the morning , and in the morning it is not far to think of sleep .
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , one of these problems with such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , it has approximately one quarter of adults sleep distur@@ b@@ ance and more than ten percent , sleep often or permanently recovered .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , and there are many different causes are under@@ lying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Com@@ missions and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what you under@@ stands , however , however , the In@@ som@@ nia is never , so an I and a sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess .
just the sleep can be found as harm@@ less or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the German House@@ hold association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ b@@ ance are complex .
behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or ra@@ cial @-@ related factors , but also consult medicines .
the ins@@ ane expression of another condition is not rare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awak@@ ening is common with depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
who for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to gre@@ asy on all @-@ day problems and give thanks , We@@ e@@ ß is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should I get to the doctor with sleep problems ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite differently , tired , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleeping trou@@ bles , it is important to find out its causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablet only in case of acceptance and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
headquartered in Germany there are hardly noticeable in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ ore , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should contact for sleeping difficulties at first time , at home , We@@ e@@ ß is at first .
the can clari@@ fy with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory physician , for example , with breathing difficulties , in disease @-@ heart@@ ly di@@ ast@@ ness , at sleep , or when you do not find the cause of a passage of a passage , says Fi@@ bre .
it is not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ bre .
after glu@@ ing , you go into the bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body you are wearing a nose , chest strap and a antenn@@ ae .
in addition , a camera sees the sleeping room to the ceiling .
how can I get any problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of locking screws on which you can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not to sleep to sleep , alcohol before and at night not at the clock - then you start to expect immediately , and that &apos;s all and not eligible to ensure that .
what is the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German flo@@ at Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been dis@@ ap@@ pointing to the DS@@ V teams at the Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
in December 2014 he took up gold for the first time in Doha and took up his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected via Facebook to be protected against his former former ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € Pr@@ emia and one jung@@ le of 150,000 € should not wonder about lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the feed system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , were very good .
that &apos;s why we can not compete with countries that do not require a lot and operate at the topic D@@ oping - not so accurate or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be hired here , &quot; he explained .
if he wanted to com@@ eback to com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported already nine months before his first start of the national anti @-@ d@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly how to keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de Ban@@ de Bag@@ gage R@@ ails
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil invasion of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police was able to arrest two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts alleged that Ban@@ de had committed several pocket and luggage bars .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs civilian civil servants detected a ban@@ de again at the airport Düsseldorf Airport , which was known as the polic@@ emen from last theft .
the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ph@@ ins in the middle of July of this year and have been working very professional .
the specialists of the crime nov@@ els 34 can do the dens@@ ities , specifically for off@@ ences of offen@@ ders to Germany , four do@@ ings .
they had a total of more than 15.000 euros .
Alt@@ buildings , a few Left Baker , in between even a rest head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous sites &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one comes to play places , a refresh@@ ing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
for the facade of a gray house som@@ eb@@ ody has ug@@ ly ! &quot; spec@@ kl@@ ed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it will be built here : by 2017 there is an house with a high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
article about these &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are pre@@ illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks .
this is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , meanwhile the residents are occupied , but there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator had several times for a tough approach to the project , the well known as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
having been cleared on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , had pat@@ ched the police three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site , closed parts of the road and held visitors from it to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building staff in the order of the unknown house owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , sitting in front of the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others entert@@ ain about Sp@@ et@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are mainly from the police site .
with the residents of skin projects they distribute the concern before rising rentals and genetic disorders .
it does not sound according to a pine , which wish to handle more complex protection from v@@ and@@ al@@ ating left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin sp@@ ens@@ or@@ ator and police between cattle and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional labour area , which today has a lower average age and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
also houses and the nati@@ ves are already long to the surrounding area : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including virtually the whole main@@ road street near the Riga .
while the ma@@ inst@@ ances were cleared under a controlled road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are still inhabited by people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter in the past few years became increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner of all over the world : with them now residents of GDR times and former houses will divide their p@@ ine@@ z .
this can also be felt during rentals in 2009 , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them missing slices or fresh@@ ly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to paint .
no other road this year was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
one reason for this , that not all neighbours can be seen as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : offen@@ ders such as body injuries , according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make up atomic facts rather the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years , can no talk of un@@ certainty .
what violence is concerned is it important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who don &apos;t have been determined .
also the famous burning cars will give you no longer in the Riga car anymore .
for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal case , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , living together on the road and gets more of each other with , than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn and stayed in the Riga street .
therefore , it was so important that the residents got their way back : by the police , politics and media , which in July all suddenly taken the deadline over the neighborhood .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through new buildings built in former buildings , which inhab@@ it the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are finally con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Viol@@ ence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction can &apos;t be gu@@ essed . &quot;
but what should one do if a man never stops ?
it focuses on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are over color bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
who attrac@@ ts , should be aware of it - just like someone , who moves in a quarter @-@ quarter , can be easily compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons named in the fore@@ name have asked to be asked to be named , not named with its name .
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee institution
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organiz@@ ational matters .
also she is a social worker spot .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been a refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it can be seen as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administrative , authorities and who else are missing .
RE@@ G@@ INE client of the working group indicates that the honorary might have more than than@@ k@@ ful , that Deu@@ ver@@ le now is there , the pleasure of wo@@ ol@@ factory , which has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cking as much instead of the variety of tasks wish to be targeted - commonly referred to as the administration wanted to write the place .
we searched for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a whol@@ es@@ hip wo@@ ol@@ factory .
but administrative labour is not its central area , comments appro@@ ach@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , there are about organization , working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
she had a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer who supports An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Ehr@@ en- and Great official actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem since some time , to find flats for the close @-@ fle@@ ets that have been recognized .
the municipalities are competent for connecting the connection .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented hab@@ itats .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
responsibility has been changed from Land@@ rat@@ chet to the community and a job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to do not find private apartments .
it has not been working so far , to get to private apartments , then Deu@@ ver@@ le .
hence the rural homes must be am@@ ous , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a permanent stay there are inter@@ places , training places , school places , one @-@ Euro jobs and encour@@ agement for refugees and migrants that have to be m@@ illed or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do @-@ profit @-@ making work - and the motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outdoor effect .
this was &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not only work .
the day do a solid structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
men would have to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so , offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
this also jump in management and honorary positions .
it is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense to the time , for example , with language courses .
those who could get the feeling of development , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate itself .
the significant majority are motiv@@ ated .
problem cases are but also , says customer hon@@ est , &quot; People where nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack is called ch@@ ai@@ v like &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a remaining risk could but not complete them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sen@@ si@@ zing are the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents were also the subject of refugees .
they were afraid that the attack they had completely destroyed completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would glad@@ ly stay in ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary @-@ volunte@@ er must look for activities and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new ship could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer this question .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not arrived there where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher was already as@@ le@@ ached to integrate thanks to previous people .
there are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
