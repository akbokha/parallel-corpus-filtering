<seg id="1">Clint and trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - which is to both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unone are the two US presidential candidate at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns before, as the state of the economy will harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to regulate the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different, said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive some rauliers massively, and he makes himself a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton against that says: the state has appointed certain tasks, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax for the rich is increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton become almost wortely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate, announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are the classic-democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical team-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be an internal discussions on the trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and resilize coal plants in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to cancel the Paris Climate agreement" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton wants to expand and urges the renewable energies with their investment program:" "" "a country will make the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only for infrastructure - also at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, which is a trade agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them want to insulated the United States by the international trade, but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They then should be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump in this question is not clear: once say he says: the minimum wage must be ron, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the next months is likely to develop more about the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one hand, Trump, who wants to reload the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics have before him, so that the budgetary deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton says that at least from the rich he wants to pay more tax, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who alone will flee, almost as long as everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often sad.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sit four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He snails with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>

<seg id="11">They smiling short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is part of Condrobs division, a sponsor for social auxiliary offers in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentral accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Relief Association.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been opened officially.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here has made on her run experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically pursued because of them torture or death, or because their families send them as a hope to Europe," says it.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape: "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honor of honour, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives her away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "that tugboat for a bottle of water for a bottle of sexual action is no rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whoever believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany, tell Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">The standing women would often be regarded as a mindful women in refugee quotas often and abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the Munich's North, is sad and estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are as usual that they can say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they trust not to speak openly about the earth, because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not need to help others, it need more accommodation only for them, requesting Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven district rains are responsible for the placing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">To the question whether they wasted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken, there are not something that should not be found in governments of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben, women alone are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press review of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia are available in some common floors or their own houses only for single and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The European Parliament's rights and gender equality must also be challenged by women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women are set up separately."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external vibrations"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and the official end of the eight months of lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter in the gilded hall in the St. Petersburg Palace of St. Petersburg, I cannot make sure that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the action, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But putting into the smile had its narrowly and radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to his "dear friend" Putin, according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had so benevolve, than that would never happen something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed to me rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin was brilliant, sustainable cooling showed that the Russian state of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was walled burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divides and accused Ankara to withdraw Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The insurrection was even bigger, since it was committed by a good friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The showcases rebuild again will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media initiated a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed to be, the Turks would bear all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the allegations of conductive officials were benefited from their own family from illegal oil retailers in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look back.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin was trying to apprehend the President of the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice are clear at hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all friends who can get received after he became the last month in a failed coup d'etat of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic images.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions were hard hit in Turkey - in particular, the ban of charters that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and batches will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisoconal side tower in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national television approached fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural products are imported.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" tourists "" tourists "long" "" long "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is wealable in the West, since its reaction to power was considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued hanger of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian state-of state won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d "Ã©tat for the chosen state of State.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well-known for Moscow a self-intelligible, which has changed a deeper fearful fear of regimezer.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace in the sea enabled the Russia and Turkey, one as it described me a analyst, "Alliance of outsider": two countries who are catching off from the West and poorly treated so badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite the public conciliation, there are always great differences between the two others.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace of peace, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours, both presidents appeared on the press conference, said they would not have undergone the topic once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator could be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey declared the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin humert Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin relieved his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of the close contact of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin it is that Putin was deferred under his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino who was the deputy-representative of Ivanovs since 2012 was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website, it is called (in Russian) that he later became the head of log head and administration of the government's government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of government to assist your activity as state-of-of-the law and inspections on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuade the smiling Faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage has made secret lost in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time of a close contact of Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV in television, both men deemed that the Chief of Staff was redirected at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite being a lot for cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this a consequence of a kind of power combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">The one knows no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once glorified as a potential President was to lead to even the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the site of Kremlin I said Ivanov, "it's true that I asked you in a conversation between the beginning of 2012 - they could have been very complicated - they could have been able to trust - requestable for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it emerged, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as a former member of the State Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Aviation Security Service (FSB), Ivanov became deputy chairman of his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin met his power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in most of them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was supposed to be President of Russia in Putto the second term of President of Russia, since a third term of putting into the Constitution had been cast against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, near-end ally plaster, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became a president in three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Â£1.35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown was appointed a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensland Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a shortfall in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heifer activity that require extreme precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of all BrÃ¼ckendecks in their place and the last part of the decks are in Rosyth a concrete deck for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place.</seg>

<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents a trendsetting top and deep construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street-section and its connection with the northern northern hemisphere, we had to close the still existing gap on the North or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern town bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very finicky job.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, approx. 6,000 tons, and at a gradient of approximately 3% had to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fincle because the tolerances, which the team is working, they were tiny - at each side, it amounted to only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD suggests the next ratings for the "Action Concept Living."</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent of dwellings as social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new residential building programme that will cost millions and will be financed even to incentivize.</seg>

<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, which will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the program is not completely completely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be traded in.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments, whose mining is going to go out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">PokÃ©mon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, how the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child did not go beyond outside, but rather preferable to spend their free time in doing on screens, was complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go, it will cause people to collect and active people from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and lastly limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are unable to exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I interconnect myself of course to the PokÃ©mon Go-Wahn, an app that were created for video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, games cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sunk the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand which overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days, PokÃ©mon Go more users than Tinyms and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go with their smartphone outside, looking for PokÃ©mons that will be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found once, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which regained the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">With Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users, announced that the Washington Post informed that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, that jumped every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays PokÃ©mon Go - only the raw data of the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to take up "" "" to take people "" "" of the sofa "" "" to come "" "" of the sofa "" "" and "" "" day to be active. "" "" because many public messages are bored and people are coming to everyone who look like. "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sport, reduces his opportunities to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to run it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to PokÃ©mon Go is that there are people to do something in the open, that fun makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health benefits - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt for new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mÃ¼rg game destroys, that must always be complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps were already able to follow our activity as Fitbit earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose his maturation and the use will be returned with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will join apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people in the hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel subject to its immune system and dignity of a serious examination - having draining some of the most polluted and feculiar sites in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moderator and voyautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will hand over to a Euro-Schein, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing pot of a pull-out space as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the leak every object he used a Luminometer to show yourself and show us what he turns.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, that was filmed by the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to hide the rinsing button of a pull-out space which has already been used by thousands of others, can be fully eased, but actually there are more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left everything he left, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things as well as wonderful things." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to rinsing nulls of toilets, the task turned his immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I have put all things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In his film he was just righteous for his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he was refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His dentures showed a luminance of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminance of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to be refused after their luminance had over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a little less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial population at different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "this comes to the worst thing that I have roasted in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll feel nothing at this, because there is indoor use here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company took Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation of Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of Probiotics ".</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy Brainstormings that we finished saying "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">It claim that the interest in health business is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the significance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and we could provide the consumption of more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, said: "let me lose my respect for Ian, when he had tasted some of the things I have instructed to him, like the eky Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, where it was simpler, Ian, to bring it, and others where this was quite hard.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of this dirty leakeup on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out from the year 2015, 84 percent of those questioned lactic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries increased by nearly a sixth place.</seg>

<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony was further limited by diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition deficit of 0.9 per cent is equivalent to 3,37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group CEO Fred Kappler was able to present a sales expansion from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software gas tests.</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "Volkswagen itself uses the term" "" "guarantee" "" "but not as it was in corporate identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers for example a half year after retrofitting approximately with one engine damage to a workshop - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also important to avoid the customer's customer, that there is nothing to do with the abassorabal damage, which means nothing to do with the abassoral guarantee, such as it was called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buy siles?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love sheets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you have to divide the comment on it, in order to surprise him under the pseudonym non-slip cases with harrows, this statement now runs from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most common resignment of sound records came not to an boom in millennials that greet the realities of physical objects, but due to the Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a plate are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by Hobbies - it has a emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend some time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow an news report on TV would like to follow the camera, while I remain in amidst a busy street in Soho, before I stop, my hands hold and somewhat more immense of things like: "so let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart rises to SoHos slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent Seller are located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'd like to ask the camera, I would like to switch the camera for the next part in which I meet in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to underestimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I say of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors, and I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" I guess "says he.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed after him), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available entry: it is now able to buy sheets when he had appeared and again buy articles that he had sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late '60s, early' 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true to those who buy the boards, rather giving, and gladly spend some time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers who hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who influenced by the Medienpe, people who have heard about the comeback and will have happened to buy their old plates back.</seg>
<seg id="24">Concerning the talks, which I have led, people usually have taken care of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs will now sell their CDs to buy back their records. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in a particular age of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It just takes some seconds in a shop as phonica to realise that record business provides a relaxing community of equine inns.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contact-free payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of the baffing plate, from objects to call the happier excursions.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of material ownership, as a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to continue intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soldered a staff of a plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people purchased a board have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also revealed that 41% have a record players who never use them while 7% of those who have a plate, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report, I probably would look very worried about, while I blamed a stack of Bossa Nova Compile versions.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age), has noticed a "trophies" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only recently came here and said," I am sitting a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound top that I can put it into the shelf, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musiklasty.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who only purged slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor has a blower audience, than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples about 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women's middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops is - Wild Beasts latest Synthesis and sexes Pop instead of experimental Jazz goes from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nagant psychic sadness are hard to be fixed when you see someone at someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and consider the variation of the available plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a paddle stealer as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't earn much, so the collecting of plates do not say real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a lovely plagues.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers: urban Outback.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to sample the jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager cameras for a moment to purchase Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to hold them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction in these objects could mean more money for the industry, and some customers send in the depths of soHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research studies showed that the results of YouGov will vote, at least in Soho, the great number of female collector in Soho, who exist in reality, sheet shops and in Onlineforums are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">Those people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through Lake stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by slabs, while they fall short of an unsecret, 30-year-old moderator, who rises above the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, settled.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a venue this week argued the authorities in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops within the camp goods, of cigarettes to Energyote, sell, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a few euro in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture are argued that these places would be overthrown because they would not be paid a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that's a fire and a risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">All humanitarian groups divided into court with that business and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the nationally supported association and other groups are not enough to offer enough food for growing numbers in the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also brought out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accomodation and free meals for people in need to offer.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 provisional shops, but dreamed that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are absolutely essential."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that the food business, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than only people who live "in extremely preprecarious terms."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of tranquil relations between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the remorsel was the Jungle Book Kids' CafÃ© of the camp, which is commonly operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum for the hundreds of needy people, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition in order to maintain the Kids's CafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was that the closure "for that children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two auxiliary organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new slender in the course of the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The amazing performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop during the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio here with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a masterpiece in the handling, side-stepping, back of the back, liner and raw force to win gold - their first Olympiamaille every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sunk by the non-bad TrostPrize of the Silver Medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day may fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in this form Fiji could be beaten in this form a 15 man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a comfort for GB - but it probably is probably not - that at least a gold medal around his neck will hang around his neck: Fijis chief manager Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This snap will wake up, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was feeling the captain of Tom Mitchell and co. on, when the World Series winners run 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau placed on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has hardly arrived 12-0 and GB.</seg>
<seg id="16">A prestige of Mitchell stopped off the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to get a third goal but it only stopped Fiji only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner was a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning with the re-catch and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou are preceded by a further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like it was Fiji who was born to play the 7 while GB still learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half time and completed the fijiagic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-season, until Joshua was going through Tuisova following a Brilliant Interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a touch for GB, made a touch down in the left corner of a 36-7, but the game was already long in favor of the South Atlantic, whose fans swapped and danced at the Tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i tdot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff-Ã¶nte, the Fijis emaged and GB are routed and beaten up in the grass.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through the fight with the cancer of the trainers to win the rowing...</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold when playing these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing boat to the last, 220 hard Hieve which enter into the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it were only the ones sitting on the Ruder, there were three voices im boat. the Echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was all present at the second Olympiagold in branch without tax wife in succession, the first women in the history of the British sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.are unleaded operation, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete, which slides over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each Gold at the Rudern there is a battalion to give helpers who make the difference and there was no more helpful than the trainer, who would not know that he would survive this day at all, than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said that he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had a bladder cancer that is operational and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreadeth everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty worse situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to begin the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, so that the interruption for a minimum, if this could be the right term even under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It starts like this.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing itself is a challenge, but this makes it even larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the case of the victory there went their first thoughts to Williams, who spent a nervous morning to talk a little more than otherwise and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the centurion of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also have worked Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would not have a massive Danke to him. it is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have a better person for trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch Stanning and Glover to reserve a lot in reserves.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were then imprisoned at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in trial, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of them.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something of the rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to see today no fireworks, we wanted to win a good result, go out and win the race, what we did so.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since next week, Glover has to appear on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer of Steve Bshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now I want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I would not say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: sing prays good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has already accompanied her whole life: as a young woman she was in school choir, at the teaching position, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, it feels great, cheerful and totally alive, says it.</seg>
<seg id="5">And at the door of her health, they doing something good at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and divide the joy of music with equackles of music.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular merges, senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">For often social and family structures are often exposed, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also has made Ursel Kipp made in their choir: "to arrange and to organize and learn to others - a choir is a very special form of the compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">Can sing in the positive sense, Hackles writes.</seg>
<seg id="12">For they exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly requests his lung, even in everyday life are not as fast as the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Swiss Consortium for the senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher degree of power, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people are sparked many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people themselves escape their lying events in a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of singing the head requires a special performance, says Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to concentrate on their own voice and at a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not only practice themselves on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition, which rides through the singing in the choir, Hackles writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is growing by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Self: show yourself: if I do something for something, I'll get better and watch over me - these experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">So good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If anyone wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he believes, little talent, will avenge Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You sing not alone - at 50 sing people who hears it when once a sound goes up next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the matching offer, Senackles has different possibilities, says Hackles.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sings from a head-circle in a senior parenchyma, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer reviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right directly to the church or church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors will also find over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If any one has no access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours may ask help for the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing, shouldn't connect to a choir.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul good and has just a liberation - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US win fourth match in the field of hockey, a showdown with great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 seal over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said it could not remember to have ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place, which stay after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet next round in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two will get in each group of six teams in each of the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place finish will lead to the strong Dutch, somewhat longer from the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game can go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host of their success story, four years after the last London Games have landed on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania while she had a hockey racket in their hands (their two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), at 16 years she became the national champion of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008 when it was unable to qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team passed away everything.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the subsequent year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, and thus began to make things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, an incremental change, and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the job-job in London, which we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can rip off the ruin.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the goal in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed untough and kept the playing time from 1-0 to the third quarter till Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It carried out a Sprint with the flat ball about the left flank, then moved to the middle and lupbeat the ball in the gate to procure the Americans a 2-0 tour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez was the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the goal of the US, Jackie Briggs, who had to make a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Like bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the heart of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too late as it is too late for the Olympic Games too.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and untrained, a rapid relay for competition and strewns.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is provided by the wristwatch to the Turner at the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to TV, a newspaper read or listen to your neighbors in the waiting long in Coffeshop, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leuty or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are logan dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples, could have definitely be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if it were a swimmers, Turner or even fancy.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not lit any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow, the sports that are not generally acknowledged: air guns, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may reign for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me get the attention of the discrete charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines had already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was annoying that many of whom I had asked, did not know that it is at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Igilance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes competing for competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are invited to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian, to divide the women to the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong in China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolines skip a certain exterior charme, in part because it sounds for a clownsard that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never too excited calls - but also the Grazie of the Turnens and Dives that combines two sports.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish-bounder-trampoline, which means a lot like "jumps."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves (turning, hreal and salad) before they landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to the official programme, difficulty, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Officers from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hoping must go beyond gold for gold, faster, upward, and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes and back, to the top and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV broadcast, another one-known objective: the world or Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented streb is Nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's the thing that I own even while watching these games as a little effort.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she supervised, seemingly heavy heavios like a astronaut, go down, then down, then back up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant repeal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of the women will be held in Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who is likely to see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of consciousness can only be reached by the attacking and the object of male athletes, according to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects his air round off to the air in the morning.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that eighty protesting during clashes with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together now?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid construction of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government afflicted the country and far more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people hit the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was unbarred according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen had shot down armed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movement, videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety merchants young people with staves, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to assemble this country and yet it will even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence service collaborates closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cush's economy grew in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted to silence what dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or put into the wake of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you underpress people and these no other options have nothing to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Thome, a teacher in central Ethiopians." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the soil to the worshipping in terms of power of the regained coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and therefore control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the stresses go along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zag, controversial line, in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who in the last years more or less than were forced to engage, and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years of survival have now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the past few years, many Ethiopian workers were able to communicate through the social media because cheaper smartphones and more frequently were improved and improved by Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government shut access to Facebook and Twitter, whatever they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, do many people still communicate over the Internet Proxies that they keep up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian showed that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest Ethnic in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Equations prosperated the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia, predominantly of Christian breaches, in the politics and the economy, while the Oromos took off, of which many Muslims are living and live in Flachland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordination with a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominating unfair by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, in the secret services, politics and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">In 2012, Mr. Meles, a former reclaim leader, was forced to death in a non-public disease in 2012 for 17 years, with Ethiopia, prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that it was particularly compensated in that, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special assigned to work opponents and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this basic," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians, Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively insignificant reasons to take the status of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Another as Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, is Mr. Hailemariam from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analytics say that he did not enjoy the trust of the Tigers controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had one such riots had experienced in 2005 after thousands against elections, according to the information of analytics, the government failed and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though there were less than in the last months, and that period of disturbances were relatively speeded.</seg>
<seg id="52">Based on Ethiopia, Ethiopia, leaders for their visionary infrastructure plan, as well as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not been the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month a protest in Gondar, a amharic city, headed by Tigray, and the hatred opposite the Tigray is always experienced in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analytics say that the protests inherited the United States and other Western allies into a separate position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently hasted that it was closed on the basis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship's research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland was only sold after 150 years of youngsters.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the ground of the northern Atlantic coast, in an hour he comes in an hour an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes up, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and is almost as fast as a Robbe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">That was characterized by loneliness, but seems to be a cylinder position for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal "Science" at any point of Greenland, which could be 392 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means that this life expectancy for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist presumed long that Greenland will be staging.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hawie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice-sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer the water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they dive in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland's Greenland lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time lupunempo limbs them when they took six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">They nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had aroused the jaw of a young iron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kadaver, that swings out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, Fishermen, between 2010 and 2013, in front of Greenland or Svalbard from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 is cm size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already built before the birth of sharks, which are contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when atomic tests are larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimetres in length, the lens-core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 due to nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland hairy had normal Carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was actually shown for a 493 centimetres of Greenland, an age of 335 years, while the record of Hai with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-birds only grew after-up, when they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be reached on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">And this is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in iron waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the old record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, a 120-year-old harpoon pointed tip, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism from there live animals living on savings banks.</seg>
<seg id="36">They turn later - and alighters slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to which the animal is swallow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on how many offspring as soon as possible," says the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="18">The price was rather proudly: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could do in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="3">For me, this is the biggest attraction Heathrow, just as we were in London in 2012 when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions profited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will come again by creating new possibilities for local and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprentices, some 40,000 new jobs and a youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of London in 2012, there will be such that the challenge of the extension Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and we will be able to blamaze us at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bifles were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to survive, but Heathrow answers to any questions asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, Â£211 billion at witty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in quite GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has earned a Â£11 billion valuable infrastructure programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was elected five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequencies test drives of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to supply a third catwalk, which is supported by Â£16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time to expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow as well as to ensure future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment, which can be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once in the computer of a victim, it seeks specifically for unlong changing files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software will present the requirements of the compresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victim need money - usually in the form of Cryptowne Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where with private use the personal photo database on the game is, it works for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the loss falls off when a centime is added.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms registered sales loss by Ransomware, 13 percent had to break the business activities completely, in case of a case.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals already were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of acute disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you can only promote the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators of the perpetrators, in view of standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The chipper turn to know and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety forgers of F-Secure explores the user surface and get to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free-to-accessible support sites or undecrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private people after payments of a few hundred Euros will have to pay companies part hard negotiation and five-digit sums to get their data undecrypt.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risk winnings from the Ransomware Erpressation, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains safety sexes Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus vendor SOPHOS: "a single person can write an omansomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely it is that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their contingsoftware then in the form of a software building box to the actual press operators.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by providing malware, advise and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes an adaptable tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The compressors are looking for more hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per registered computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "the criminals" "" "rainy with the spread" "", "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the IT-IT managers in the Malwarebyte-survey rely on to retrieve Ransomware by file-back-ups and scan software.</seg>
<seg id="39">The perpetrators have already been pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threats for successful pathology more, threaten the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as some customer lists or pricing" "", "Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential of any kind of data even so much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Security Conference Defcon demonstrate security forgers as they were able to receive control with the Internet linked thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the sectioning of a kind of blockaded system could definitely be a ransom value.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators have then to block a factory in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic of Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and flexible working</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to put everything: a little SUV, a little CoupÃ© and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty reload, but the HR V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually flexible in everyday life as a decidedly flexible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, and there's no place close to any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortably, only the cockpit of the inside falls off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk trunk of 453 l at the same time and 1026 l under hinged back-backs, but there are the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magically, than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backbench can be valves and provide the storage space that is high from the floor to the ceilings 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space is slightly loaded, but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to teach his work somewhat more quiet.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine of engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is set to be a bit direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment available in the tested top variant "Executive" is nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system is part of the security systems (operates till tempo 32), the collisions system and the microsettian assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes, the collisions were sometimes irritated sometimes because he has been rated as "wandering objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable, the remote control system works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller respond to traffic sign recognition and throttle when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for top facilities: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI connector located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-equipped gasoline-diesels are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much will the petrol engine will get from 20000 Euro, the diesel is starting from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening we will roll off for ever, at night there is hour for hours in the morning, and in the morning it is not far to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one of these problems with such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, it has approximately one quarter of adults sleep disturbance and more than ten percent, sleep often or permanently recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbance, and there are many different causes are underlying, emphasises Hans-GÃ¼nter WeeÃ, member of the German Society for Commissions and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you understands, however, however, the Insomnia is never, so an I and a sleepless.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the sleep can be found as harmless or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the German Household association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbance are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychic or racial-related factors, but also consult medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">The insane expression of another condition is not rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common with depression." "" "says WeeÃ." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example, who has a herniated disc, can be poorly lying, wakes every two to three hours and starts to greasy on all-day problems and give thanks, WeeÃ is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should I get to the doctor with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and impaired on the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite differently, tired, tired, tired, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical symptoms such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleeping troubles, it is important to find out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medications - classic sleep tablet only in case of acceptance and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Headquartered in Germany there are hardly noticeable in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fiore, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should contact for sleeping difficulties at first time, at home, WeeÃ is at first.</seg>
<seg id="24">The can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory physician, for example, with breathing difficulties, in disease-heartly diastness, at sleep, or when you do not find the cause of a passage of a passage, says Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a nap," says Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, you go into the bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body you are wearing a nose, chest strap and a antennae.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera sees the sleeping room to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get any problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of locking screws on which you can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">WeeÃ is on: regular sleep and standing times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not to sleep to sleep, alcohol before and at night not at the clock - then you start to expect immediately, and that's all and not eligible to ensure that.</seg>

<seg id="24">One reason for this, that not all neighbours can be seen as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: offenders such as body injuries, according to almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make up atomic facts rather the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house for 17 years, can no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence is concerned is it important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who don't have been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will give you no longer in the Riga car anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her road is not a criminal case, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, living together on the road and gets more of each other with, than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn and stayed in the Riga street.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the residents got their way back: by the police, politics and media, which in July all suddenly taken the deadline over the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through new buildings built in former buildings, which inhabit the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there are finally condominiums, which are not interesting for many people - here are rather people who are not so good." "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"Violence and Destruction can't be guessed."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if a man never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">It focuses on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are over color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts, should be aware of it - just like someone, who moves in a quarter-quarter, can be easily complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons named in the forename have asked to be asked to be named, not named with its name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuverle is a new refugee institution</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuverle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizational matters.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also she is a social worker spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuverle has been a refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogy supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can be seen as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group refugees, administrative, authorities and who else are missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE client of the working group indicates that the honorary might have more than thankful, that Deuverle now is there, the pleasure of woolfactory, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking as much instead of the variety of tasks wish to be targeted - commonly referred to as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We searched for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a wholeship woolfactory.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative labour is not its central area, comments approachka Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, there are about organization, working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She had a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was the highest time," "" "says Regine customer who supports Annika Deuverle Ehren- and Great official actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the WasenstraÃe</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem since some time, to find flats for the close-fleets that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are competent for connecting the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented habitats.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility has been changed from Landratchet to the community and a job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto do not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not been working so far, to get to private apartments, then Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hence the rural homes must be amous, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the WasenstraÃe.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent stay there are interplaces, training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and encouragement for refugees and migrants that have to be milled or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do-profit-making work - and the motivated and very tidy, like Annika Deuverle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outdoor effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This was "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day do a solid structure, say Deuverle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Men would have to develop a seniority.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, offers offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">This also jump in management and honorary positions.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense to the time, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who could get the feeling of development, he could not work in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases are but also, says customer honest, "People where nothing goes." the work of Deuverle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">This is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two are afraid of radicalization, even in a small congregation like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer very clearly," "" "what lack is called chaiv like" "". "a remaining risk could but not complete them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensizing are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attack they had completely destroyed completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would gladly stay in urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary-volunteer must look for activities and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new ship could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not arrived there where we would like," says Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer also makes clear that the Urbacher was already asleached to integrate thanks to previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
