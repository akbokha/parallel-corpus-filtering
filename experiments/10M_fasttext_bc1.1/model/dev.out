Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the ratio between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as in T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ istic measures in the Middle East .
however , at the meeting it is said to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises the persist@@ ence settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of comp@@ elling will in the peace process .
through the Obama &apos;s advert@@ ised deal , the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two continued .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu declared to the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US congress , which was re@@ valued primarily as an aff@@ air against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting was denied this with reference to the present election in Israel .
at a emergency call , professor to having shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb talked with a somewhat conden@@ sed voice of the police that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb is important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; but still live and probably grew up , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the Arab@@ s were critic@@ ized by A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that on a white block was critic@@ ized , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman whom I loved . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no note that the fact that was shot in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , who had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he was shot at the door to a popular monument professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door leading to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ si@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that it eventually made the fat@@ eful day of emergency eventually .
by the end of the day he had another death : he took life as the police introduced him .
one day after the shooting at the University , students and do@@ z@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to imagine a picture of what is motiv@@ ated .
that was made by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , including that , what students and people who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the Police at G@@ auti@@ ous died where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he did not have a story of violence or a criminal record .
from it , Schmidt himself mentioned his book written in a book written in him in which he told the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; that he shared his academic life .
both sub@@ du@@ ed in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both of them .
at the same time there were in@@ clin@@ ations about problem behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who pra@@ ising God , he seemed that he too little nerv@@ ous and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something is wrong with it . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told him that he told him to have stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
it had previously been asked the del@@ ta State University to ask for health reasons for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the University important that the promotion worked out so hard for the Lamb that would not pose no warranty for a automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor would be present .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , knowing nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ech vision . &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer the answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police captured Lam@@ bs as soon as he was captured in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before being arrested , self @-@ adhesive , self @-@ winding down on a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol at the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the one way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew people knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , he began his work at the University , which has about 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in education in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ ech made him a intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met in common friends .
they and their friends were high school in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar game for some years .
it was at that time of women .
all the girls still mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and pris@@ oning were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call : I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in the auti@@ stic building .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the former husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were barely 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
her and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he never met His daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail . but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that music was interested in music and blues .
I met Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came on both one summer time three years ago .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been a nurse , which worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a faint bar at the night of September 5th to the last time looked at Lamb &apos;s guitar and mouth harp will end before a fun audience .
there was no signs there that anything did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at cleaning and fri@@ ars .
I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead dog , professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , &quot; says Don Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood Society and Student Committee .

the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I perc@@ eive that the seat is beside me apart , and it will gradually be clear that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for the forth@@ coming documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN head states there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is saying : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will be reduced by violence and mis@@ ery in millions of people only wor@@ sen .
the UN CEO again calls for all parties , including the United Nations Security Council , to un@@ ite and integ@@ rative negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an announced a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the sub@@ divisions take place within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation un@@ c@@ ash@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an requested the five permanent members to show in Syria the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving an Iran &apos;s nuclear deal with Iran .
8 conver@@ sions that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to sign him as a flop .
other than one joke was done .
and some wait for a collapse .
but it doesn &apos;t matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to tigh@@ ten Donald Tr@@ ump from the top of them at poll@@ s , it doesn &apos;t work yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask ourselves what it means the opportunities of the nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at that time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys lead to the rising of Herman Cain , but none of whom won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but foreign groups like J@@ eb &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s assets and start their dollars to flow it .
here are some current conver@@ sions that indicate that the property in Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps application values have turned 180 degrees rotated .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidate in mid @-@ June , showing a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
approximately three of them say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa demonstrated last week that 60 percent of the ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ tors would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidate .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the ublic@@ ans they were either &quot; insp@@ ires &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or are &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; If J@@ ber Bush , the favorite of the Estonian , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump refused to critic@@ izes around 52 percent of the estim@@ ating statements for its @-@ atomic fact that the real estate business mo@@ cks have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same figure is considered to be in the first anti @-@ voting state of the nation , state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans declared that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still think 44 percent , that it did not have the personality to exp@@ ire effectively and almost six out of 10 accidents that its temper@@ ament is not in the White House of P@@ asse , ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters felt p@@ am@@ per@@ ed up with the idea .
when you set up their money , republi@@ can elec@@ torate Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked to fight those who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten late July you put their money on J@@ n Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters were not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans reported that Rick Perry won the nom@@ ination at only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters want to take a pl@@ au@@ sible campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans took up another candidate , Tr@@ ump still attacks almost every one .
some experts refer to the sh@@ atter@@ proof field probably to join Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , whereas the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority of the majority .
he has before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points advantage , especially Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ n Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich , and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race .
a great majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans claims that they have formed their own opinion .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have received their voices .
of course , a lot can come to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they will leave the door open to change other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition at the moment of the other external bit@@ er , neuro@@ surgery Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors they say that they have formed their own opinion , are twice as many as Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immig@@ ration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump has been named as &quot; rape &quot; in his election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immig@@ ration - and fishing point in the public dis@@ course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ ber exc@@ el exc@@ el tur@@ pl@@ ano @-@ Americans is the number of His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as the immig@@ ration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently still pract@@ ised .
the fru@@ stration over the government so@@ aked for new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son already accounts for around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their external side status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say on the new Mondays survey of ABC / post , they prefer to use a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad in Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , dating two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent .

in the street a square metre square metre space is on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer is limited to objects and is only in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special locations have a square metre square .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top @-@ living rooms , the price just like Pe@@ an@@ uts .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream starts thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller on the FC Bayern the way to a comp@@ ress@@ er 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ eus - then ran it .
a sover@@ eign start to the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created the FC Bayern in the hex@@ enk@@ arm@@ chair by pir@@ ate in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to T@@ elec@@ tor &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and I@@ i@@ do@@ l hits ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth month in series will be the first step towards the finale at the 28th of May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola is finally trying to get the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller was awarded with his 28th showing in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership of the Olympic Tor@@ ry Roberto , who left one thought to happen as a fl@@ ank shot shot by the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; had promised US captain Philip L@@ ame in front of the game in Kar@@ ai@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 in front of the blo@@ o@@ blo@@ o@@ y fans - and the Munich &apos;s word stopped .
they showed concentrated and focused screening , without sh@@ zen .
Pi@@ raeus had gained his most recent six home games in the royal class , including fine clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also proud .
however , the Bayern , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams are un@@ defeated , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they went bra@@ ve to work with their evident effort but often to work in@@ tim@@ ely .
the attacks were led too often on the left outside of the Costa Costa , which was rare through the former Braunschweig Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i .
Müller had left the right more luck , than his slope left the right @-@ field left in the left upper too .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ad &quot; Der Ide@@ a Brown launched the poles of Poland on the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , made by Tor@@ ah Roberto with the kne@@ e of his knees ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though the Bayern regional rose to domin@@ ate game , Pi@@ raeus could set the pin of dol@@ ph@@ er .
but Manuel New was born on Tor@@ ah &apos;s keeper .

the world &apos;s World Cup has only given off after the final training of green light , the chief officer Matthias El@@ mer said to &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is quite mal@@ icious . &quot;
even during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he was driving the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the acqu@@ it Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear about 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Mu@@ eller still belonged one .
before the game it was hit in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ l .
after a smaller group of some dead Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience @-@ blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of Pir@@ ae@@ us with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impact resistant against the Munich pendant .

who har@@ sh , has a higher risk to lose teeth
if you smoke , it is not only the lung , but also the teeth - a Pots@@ damer term study close .
good news : the risk of recur@@ ring decline slow@@ down quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this long @-@ term study of an international research team has been revealed , among them several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ V@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking houses the risk of loos@@ ing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely increased their teeth after the 2,@@ 5- to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more then 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes for tooth cut are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ um , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this par@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the relation between smoking and dental loss is therefore returned to more frequent denti@@ als in smo@@ kers .
in short , as to as 50 percent you have increased the risk of c@@ aries .
however , people who had stopped with smoking , their risk could reduce their risk within a short period of time than the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the end@@ ang@@ ering was again on the levels of non @-@ smoking , the first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
let men have to persu@@ ade mankind to make non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared student leaders of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking for life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings very much in public health by the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years old did not suffer from will@@ ingly , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking has increased the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study further mo@@ ck the findings .
archae@@ ologists from the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants in the late anti@@ quity

since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are in search of the so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in Cologne , Cologne will always be placed as a specialist country for archae@@ ology production .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the ar@@ che@@ ologists were thought to find .
from text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have a church backed by explan@@ atory Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the bell tower , a cemetery with approximately 350 graves were discovered , which was probably one of the church .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP new court
in 2011 , the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system via the proposed trans@@ atl@@ antic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the cont@@ enti@@ ous private light beam devices for disp@@ utes between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to more traditional rib@@ bons in its function .
&quot; we want to take a system that trust the citizens of trust , &quot; the responsible EU Commissioner for Cec@@ ilia @-@ flo@@ ats at the show .
the Schwe@@ din plans to en@@ force the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure will be shown specifically to select the EU states and the US to meet independent judges for a new investment risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to the same part from the EU , the United States and third countries .
the second instance for the first time is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow us to rise up against ur@@ anium .
so far , the end of the case admitted each other to the refer@@ ee , a claim against its sentences .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in gear fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , it will also be transferred to an international investment court in the long term .
in this case , the disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and the EU countries might be clari@@ fied here .
the above all of the required Invest@@ or @-@ leaders &apos; arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ rators are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parall@@ el@@ ism through the companies applying damage to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national law breaks or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , Anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations signed the proposal of the EU commission as in@@ suff@@ iciently .
the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) should not be valid for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement .
the German Economic Under@@ secretary in the SPD ( SPD ) stated the plans by contrast , however , by major adv@@ ances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission Con@@ sider the reform major points , the Federal Minister of Agriculture and Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private bit@@ rators is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of the ström canal .
the European business association business @-@ Europe war@@ ned against too many new rules in order to restri@@ ct cl@@ ag@@ em@@ atics &apos;s economy .
the company could make it particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , it was called .

since his election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has expected the Prime Minister with exc@@ itement expected by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s .
Jeremy &apos;s new Labour Code , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , should make his debut in the Prime Minister and gave himself to David Cameron for the first time .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six day questions just after noon , whereby its power is probably determined by the media and the Labour ME@@ M@@ EP@@ s from the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to ski@@ p their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary report to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , since it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett and following his speech on the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of Labour leader , on Tuesday during the voice of the national an@@ them at a commemorative ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S prov@@ okes and stands at the centre of several cover pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has moved attention to itself
a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that he had stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he had recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he has advised the Labour Party , the national an@@ them to sing , &quot; independent of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers refused to serve Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s top team , and they were called to differences in differences in economy , defence and foreign policy , while under a sixth year of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as a guide .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are also eff@@ ected within Labour &quot; and Mr Cor@@ re@@ yn@@ s comments on position to the European Union and the constra@@ int with certainty .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour market to set up the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the sh@@ adows work and pen@@ sions @-@ minister stated that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; to reduce the government &apos;s government &apos;s government to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth summer president , with David Cameron , since it has been Head of T@@ ory Chef , over the last decade over the dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader who has promised another policy support , says that he &apos;s &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr. Cameron and has given more than 30,000 exc@@ uses .
Is@@ lington developed North MP has said that it is a prime minister of the Prime Minister , and that he will under@@ go both &quot; stroke spirit &quot; and the Stre@@ ites with contra@@ diction and instead , focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n told that Angela Eagle , the sh@@ adows of economic government will be represented in him , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad , for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk , that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ tr@@ s , the spokes@@ person of the lower house to discuss the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he is tied up from the politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which was often associated with the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . however , he dre@@ amed a few years later he was in that he failed .
as she was broadcast@@ ed first in TV in 1990 , the fra@@ gment has been regarded as the most important barometer of a leader and his leader under his Parliament and his position under his Parliament , although critics argu@@ ed that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and deliber@@ ately rich re@@ forms .

increases accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased by an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 has been increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result was raised without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage has been the fastest and under@@ estimated acqu@@ is@@ itions of the time of interest in the time since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar &apos;s $ 1.@@ 55@@ 05 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding common share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition range of the ri@@ vals AB has been received .

shares of glass rose by 5 % , after the mining survey indicated that he took about $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of packaging and paper serv@@ omot@@ ors MO@@ N@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sachs has placed its estim@@ ation for the company Rating on &quot; res@@ ell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the company had reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half .
the Chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are competing in expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean longer in order to potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this purchasing power would like to exceed the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the cost might hit the expansion circuit of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

inspired by the pro@@ ver@@ b &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the pe@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a j@@ av@@ elin .
the idea for this idea was a poster in pe@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , which he had seen random on TV .
since then , gr@@ illed his shop sp@@ ear , fitted with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; said Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea of Lebanese man has now been leaving the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority of the authority , she has been protected as utility patent since recently .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the sp@@ ear contains , Al@@ h@@ ay would not be betrayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tast@@ es even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;

met@@ able starts Ground @-@ dig@@ nity campaign for com@@ b@@ ating algae - di@@ arr@@ he@@ a
Met@@ bar is trying to protect the IG@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers &apos; met@@ able has started a floor plan campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di opened the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , strengthen met@@ able and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets , strengthening its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as Adelaide Show .
IG@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ in@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples and Lad@@ u@@ owners who sell tickets to the South Australian football League at loy@@ al customers .
it is expected that met@@ able further details of its Defence strategy will be published on September 29 if the wholesale distributors for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Invest@@ ors strategy .
it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A charges , and produce higher profit margin as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are quoted and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Eastern countries .
however , an@@ alysts believe such as Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di would take away approximately five percent of the food market in these two countries , but primarily will take away from all existing charges , but mainly that enrolled retailers worldwide .
a report published in this week , the analy@@ st of the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 million turnover per year and met@@ al@@ ry $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predi@@ ction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and achieved a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food market and at amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost Met@@ cash roughly $ 13 million before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ e@@ ager market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , though a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A @-@ buyers were the faithful present .
Morgan Stanley takes an increase in the food and grocery market by 3.8 percent in 2016 , to set 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne that can be cash to disappear within one decade .
met@@ able to react differently to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass &#91; Mr Dou@@ glass &#93; last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has fallen to about 1,200 percent , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , representing the operational debt reduction on sales and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , however , is investing more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ y@@ worth while improving their shops by rapid growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business guide Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and re@@ loading programs to embar@@ k are hop@@ ed and hopes that the wholesale distributors go back to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi co@@ k@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi co@@ k@@ kin@@ i deserv@@ es more praise than a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi co@@ k@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and des@@ erve the view of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise than cr@@ iti@@ que for his own behaviour .
coconut bean , the younger of talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; , falls by the inf@@ am@@ ous con@@ front@@ ation of K@@ yr@@ &apos;s with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
soon afterwards , co@@ k@@ kin@@ i and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison had soon to be separated from the Ar@@ bit@@ rators , with Har@@ rison . Har@@ rison had to sm@@ ite Har@@ rison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike K@@ yr@@ illi@@ es , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he hit a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kr@@ amp@@ i had a potential U.S. Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ ine was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals in the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I was rather fu@@ cking me is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was thrown out a little over the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost a bat to the US Open but he is not the first player that broke out a bat of Fr@@ ust with itself , and I am really happy enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he is extremely good in the US Open , even amongst the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserv@@ ed much recognition .
he has a great team around it , he has a great family around it , and I believe that he was treated a bit too severe .
he is a very good 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he is working on the team and so on , he has never worked a problem with others , he is good in shape , it &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserv@@ es it to be judged based on its own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account that , in order to take into account the crucial decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish the team is completely concentrated in the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y verses &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has made a quick way to climb the people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray ; but he wants to do some worse error , but we try to prove him the consequences of his transaction . some time outside the Ramp@@ age can think , I think it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency situation and bol@@ ted the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held ste@@ ady , the attempted to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
later on the border , as hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land , chaos re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who have fled before power were fixed for a unknown period on a stre@@ ak on the street between the two control points of the countries and built there in tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter on them moved , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and crying bitter@@ ness against Hungarian re@@ lie@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some instructed out of protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants to be sent to Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries will take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ Block at a cont@@ ingent meeting in Brussels announced no joint immig@@ ration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were imprisoned in the revised Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that ultimately the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be able to receive more than 120,000 refugees , including several from Hungary .
on Tuesday , Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union to discuss the migration crisis in the continent .
in Hungary , however , Hungary applied its hopes for a Balkan Action of Brussels or of its neighbours .
the emergency on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities commissioned more powers to stop the crisis , so that they could speed up roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian prime minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also has the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants in the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even a prison term used to create the bed wire fence around Hungary and Serbia were used .
over the last months , Hungary has been for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to an enormous bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most likely economic refugees have been looking for a better life , and not war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which appeared around midnight in Hungary , make the cross of the border or the dam@@ aging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to impos@@ e higher adher@@ es to those of human tra@@ che@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that was created by mass migration , the Hungarian government proclaimed the emergency state &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; MEP Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week but repor@@ ter of Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people during an attempt to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over to damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences against the new laws .
authorities are easy to fix the fence .
in the morning , Hungarian officials conducted two of the seven border controls with Serbia , after a train rod with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders were closed .
chaos linked the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary was opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of humans and a crowd pressed in order to twi@@ sting them there .
around 20 were able to enter , but thousands were left outside .
another group of migrants started the most important highway between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse to refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton arrived at a national survey before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
the former U.S. Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton keeps back a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet declared to be announced for the presidential office , receives the support of 15 percent of the Democratic Vot@@ ers of the Ele@@ ctions .
more than five months before the beginning of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is hard to support the candidate .
but Clin@@ t supporters are constant as the other Candi@@ dates .
since the C@@ BS News survey Clinton has lost a number of dem@@ ographic groups , while S@@ anders won some profit .
Clinton keeps a big lead in females and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have decreased .
her support for the men is clearly reduced , and S@@ anders is just 5 points back here .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage in democratic voters aged 50 years has wing@@ ed , and it and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton has yet another advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton used to go with the liber@@ als two @-@ digit lead to the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead over this group .
approximately half of the democratic voters wanted to say about the country &apos;s elections that they would support with enthusiasm , if it would be nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some pre@@ ference and a further 15 percent would only support it because they are the candi@@ dat@@ in .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
views are stronger and that they currently not support Clinton - only a quarter would love it .
while 48 percent of democratic voters will say that they have Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can elec@@ torate now tell this about its top @-@ class Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ t supporters can be asked in an open question , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman &apos;s president will be ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for jobs ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ t &apos;s support is also mentioned by Bill Clinton &apos;s ( 9 per cent ) .
approval to dealing with the problems and the di@@ ctions will also be cited .
as the vice president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential throne , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes that he should not do it .
if Democratic Vot@@ ers are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clin@@ t App@@ endi@@ ces more than half the fact that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hil@@ ary Clinton &apos;s face lead to S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race , 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters will find Clinton &apos;s election in the best chances of winning the election , but this number has fallen by 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , at the question , what is more important for a Candi@@ date , to call Democratic Vot@@ ers questions about the voters .
similarly as in the last month , there is no only democ@@ rat@@ ical candidate , a potential candidate for that voters call un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates take good results in some important characteristics of elec@@ tors of the party &apos;s pres@@ election .
multi@@ purpose look Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ds as genuine and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership quality .
Bi@@ den cuts off at the three candidates at best starting from honour , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton tru@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
a Democratic Union of Ele@@ ctions held in Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological In accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic voters were no opinion of S@@ anders .
da questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s using an personal email address and a server during the term as the Foreign Minister will continue to be happy with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced its opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came into light , split .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general consent of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views were worse by Clinton .
although Clinton has been tru@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy from the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters , just 32 percent show them as rank and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled voters are not liable for an hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled voters will not be hon@@ est and non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy and non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump still receive good notes .
of the six @-@ tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush came out best at honor .
a majority , S@@ anders more hon@@ est@@ ly , but as at Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error percentage for the sampling of 351 Democratic voters during the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son resi@@ des close to Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is situated in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
however , on the two candidates , half of the voters falls into the new survey , and others dra@@ stically cut dramatically .
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted by Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son contra@@ cted the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son could well be well @-@ assembled at dem@@ ographic groups and conflict under Republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ or John Kas@@ i , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , which is fallen below , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ n Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the survey reports on the sample of 376 people from rep@@ ublic@@ s from rep@@ ublic@@ s in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in poll@@ s , while 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
looking at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ th@@ iev@@ es for the former Neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son decided to put Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a round performance in I@@ owa .

five Members of the Brotherhood and the death of a Baruch read @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ee
almost two years after a student became a student exchange in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an compl@@ ain against five people .
members of the New York Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ s captured Ch@@ un &quot; Den@@ g during a realization date as in September 2013 and delayed his transfer to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed me .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound Back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while he attempted to go over a frozen field on a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood are not called emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was strengthened and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , such as the police .
however , they had the time to convert D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ gle@@ de his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said Chief of the police , Chris Wagner , on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members of the U@@ ten@@ sil@@ es began to hide and in principle the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood members , concerning Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ sign@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
according to a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly affected by bl@@ under strength bre@@ aches , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
many families were destroyed by the ch@@ anc@@ anas of the Brotherhood . at least one student die since 1970 , a year at the Sch@@ ik@@ ana , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
breaking teams and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment due to murder of the third grade for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the bro@@ therhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for gol@@ fing attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take the involved persons , but if there is an organization that has been officially or un@@ officially - this will come to the account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Baruch College did the Brotherhood allowed , and the bro@@ therhood was able to post their integration within the group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed raises its interest
an interest increase is coming , and the house@@ is will be in retreat , yields for bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know , how long will it take and how long will it stop .
in particular , the story of the economy has only a minor guidance on the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came out within 11 months of the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressive reserve of the Federal Reserve on raising the interest rates are often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments will react .
therefore , the US Central Bank thus emphas@@ ized that investors should not concentrate on concentr@@ ating when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that the entire exc@@ itement is possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an interest increase .
&quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; inexpensive money &quot; phase , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers .
in contrast , we are not expecting the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to seem to the seism@@ ic shock , which seem to be feared .
however , this doesn &apos;t mean that there will be no effects .
here is an old trends @-@ based look , how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases for a while has been made .
as soon as the increase happens , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there &apos;s an tendency to decrease assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , what might be reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank An@@ alysts &quot; in a recent study what happens in interest increases by F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually found in upward years - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest @-@ interest , fairly flat in the 250 days after a normal earnings after 500 days , with an average return in the last six previous cycles by 14.4 percent , according to a current analysis , which was published by Bob D@@ oll , Chief Financial Year Leader@@ board at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects of ten@@ ds tend to appear later in enh@@ ancing cycle and begin the return on it .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases them often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not give it before and to speed up a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point in an interest @-@ rate of F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , there were only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , less than expected that this is continuing and expected for the third quarter following the Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent .
Z@@ ins@@ ist on a so frag@@ ile economic scenery might be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; if this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have formed the whole year to an interest @-@ rate of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee held in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and Ö@@ kon@@ omen believe that FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade will give you an average of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases the increases from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing weakness in the GDP and was very quickly placed after the beginning of recovery in the shade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to this , this is a clear recovery of what was the worst recession in follow @-@ up phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , because the market anticip@@ ates an interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stock , when they change their strategic approach .
with bonds the strings seem to change the direction once the initial increas@@ ing@@ decrease in the cycle is made .
at the end of the increases , the balance cycle ends immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the leaders of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates would result in that yields now lead to closer and shorter bonds between longer and shorter , and leads to a crash of the curve .
high @-@ rate bonds often bring even better results in such a climate , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ ie Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ an@@ alysts &quot; in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interesting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to f@@ ed strategy requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some evidence that the market adapted to the view of the stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the profit@@ abil@@ ve is increased , credit ten@@ sions have increased , and the volume of volume has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed is shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that wrap the larger part of their business activities in the US , will benefit if interest rates rise and more attractive products .
multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse ; as an increase of the dollar will increase their products on the global market , and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive in three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ An@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet were exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
enterprises with high capital @-@ yields and low volume levels in their shares also exceeded its counter@@ parts with low quality around on average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock games , consumer will also benefit from the rising dollar .
as@@ par@@ agus could see gains of higher yields , even if experts are different , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , a member of the parliament of Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative members of the parliament critic@@ ised the transmitters for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is no difference to any commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only benef@@ ited from The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; parliament @-@ Colle@@ ctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the sending The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into classic FM , claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something of the private broadcast@@ ers .
the conservative members of Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; was stup@@ id &quot; and won no more to be distinguished by his commercial compet@@ itor .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; but it seems to be transformed into classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also looked at the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to seem to be only under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , where you only have to quote what is already on the market , Mr B@@ ingham .
the Director General has presented the alleg@@ ory and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far off his commercial compet@@ itor when it walks around live music and re@@ conn@@ aissance .
what I learn from radio 3 , that will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to inv@@ ent new music and create new works in order , I am really important to receive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that har@@ der should have been used to eng@@ age the audience , when it did so in the past because the British had less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the Hear@@ ing in the Committee on culture , media and sport , was under fire under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media , an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show was produced by Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wanted to find that the company was able to find &quot; a hit from our house barn &quot; when it was the next time a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the orders from The Voice in the future or give money of the commission starting out for other entertainment formats .
net sales in August at slow and black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the record of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Friday Friday in November has hin@@ dered the issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping mall and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into cl@@ amp .
but experts say that there are now announ@@ cing that online sales have been stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are evidence that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and go back until 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index , said the Guardian at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that online sales increased over three years ago when the buyer began to sell purchases of purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for instance at home on the sofa .
but now the one comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the retro@@ actively making turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases on the last Friday in November , last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites will r@@ ushed over .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers could be fought for bar@@ gain , buyers would be able to sell buyers .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases over Web shops can now be carried out .
at the same time , more than a quarter of the people bought clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion labels in the capit@@ als .

when you fit with a hammer or a brush on the walls of walls , you belong to a minority nowadays .
for the British employ increasingly des@@ tra@@ des@@ people to conduct home @-@ scale jobs in their houses , then the chief of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ F@@ isher , who owns the tree chain chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services to deep @-@ consum@@ able services .
hence the King@@ F@@ isher plan to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which close to crafts@@ men and open 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that they employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten commercial decisions can be taken by women .

officials of A@@ I / D@@ ob due to failure
the state court of Klagenfurt participated in the Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner A@@ I / D@@ ob .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of counter@@ part abuse .
in May 2008 , he was acquitted of all charges .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , had been out cryst@@ all@@ ine that the accused were used in the years 2006 to 2011 , when they were able to disp@@ ense out in their functions .
he costs the damage with around 400,000 Euro .
the sports were also charged for financial obligations .
this fact was the chairman of the association , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in the case of alleg@@ ation of an in@@ ert , the defence occurred , that , at no time a asset of the property was created .
the sports were supposed to have been im@@ pover@@ ished and for the sports club , for whom she had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had made a lot of time and money came out of the debt - the liabilities were killed in 2001 around 600.000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ .000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we carry the club further or un@@ lock up ? , &quot; telling one of the def@@ endants , in the bread volume of the financial council .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
all risks associated with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deposited money , our life insurance , as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having been agreed with the association : you can change the money free , only no debt must be made .
in addition , the corresponding financial statements - the payout percentage of the allowance was determined retro@@ actively to 1991 .
therefore , I have a part of the allowance for the first years , namely , from 2003 , when a Plus was paid on account .
therefore , the tim@@ ings and not detailed comments explained : the former Ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and par@@ sing of each accused were in charge of the accused , said the second accused .
why the cash flow from the association was not explicitly explained in detail , the judge asked .
the association is not interested in detail for financial ar@@ cation , it was important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 , an investigation began against the functioning of counter@@ acts , an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
the def@@ endants were returned , they declared the accused .
this securities account had ran to the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
and he knew no answer for this .
then he said that he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody had known something from that money , the Prosecutor turned into the room .
his co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed , just@@ i@@ fi@@ ably the func@@ tion@@ ably .
this bank was formulated as &quot; claim recovery . &quot;
why damage claims ? , we wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first accused was declared that it was not understood by this formulation , since the association never had suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of you from the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

period of Decision about interest rates for the US exp@@ bank
the world is watching if the U.S. exp@@ bank has come on two days on Wednesday and Thursday to come together to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest is not raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists that were inter@@ viewed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to do anything longer and the interest rates at the current rate of 0 - 0.25 percent will hold .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach to a situation in which a major central bank may be leaving the zero zone and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Leit@@ l employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good power , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however the F@@ ed could not ignore the less ro@@ uted outlook to global conditions .
she war@@ ns the markets against an increase , but the signs indicate that the od@@ ds are well @-@ suited to such a step .
the decision will be announced at 20.00 : 00 CET on Thursday
infr@@ ing@@ ing at the Delta State University decided to write permission .
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning -- and before he shot his counter@@ parts on Monday morning , Sh@@ annon Sullivan wrote a note to tell him &quot; sorry , &quot; he could make it an event , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that it was a lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning calling .
and he said , He was shot on someone and someone killed .
I told the staff of the emergency hub that police police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he chose the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody is distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police asked the An@@ ru@@ fer to his name , but he didn &apos;t know him .
there was no explanation for his shots .
when police came to the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , the dar@@ ing : &quot; I &apos;m sorry for I I wanted to do it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman whom I loved . &quot;
after writing the note , it carried out 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen enc@@ ir@@ oned him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , knowing nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ech vision . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ un@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , &quot; no more information , no evidence , &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ un@@ pack was given by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for seven years , considered a &quot; good &quot; &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had one daughter , the 19 &apos;s , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that she had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
here she worked online from home , after statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ab@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others &quot; , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said that I called upon a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
when police officers arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , coming to this night , proce@@ eding out his car to the side , fled at foot , ran into the woods and killing them with a shot .

eu@@ ros@@ ings : Lufthansa continues to build the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of construction .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
the workforce of around 1000 senior managers will cost the work in the workplace .
with the pilot movement there are in@@ the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa reaches its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the billi@@ on@@ ist Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to a profit contribution of some 500 million Euros per year from cost and detection of the airline by the airline on Wednesday .
there is no board more for passenger in the future with the Lufthansa in the future .
the cheap line of the Eu@@ ros@@ ings should be as separate as possible .
in the new Executive Board of Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , head of Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
with its re@@ sign@@ ation , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the meaning of Eu@@ ros@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
the organisation of the company has been around 120 000 people so far .

Luke Sha@@ w von Manchester United can not play for months due to double fac@@ ul@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one in the Champions League defeat at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this is the link of the left external def@@ enders to weep and dis@@ close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal didn &apos;t know the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a quick attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and required oxygen before moving into the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double foot structure and lies in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow it will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then in Manchester operates .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United has it very difficult and then it plays and then it happens .
in the changing room he had a level of oxygen .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fac@@ tual structure , then take the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the cl@@ oning of a dog .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not been punished by Mexico .
van G@@ aal insi@@ sts that the Italian refer@@ ee had been vacc@@ inated .
you can judge by yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card are due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et of the c@@ rank@@ ings : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;ll come back again . &quot;
linked to : Manchester United has suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in case of the loss at PS@@ V
the British Defender has an additional incenti@@ ve to recover from the European Championship in France until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves behind this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very gri@@ ev@@ ous because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and when you hear that it is a bad injury , isn &apos;t it good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball one going on in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like that , I know how hard it can be like something .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also transferred to the hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron known the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a matter who will soon learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost everything .
except you think , you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book chose to name the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message to the website of the company Super@@ camps , and goes on : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as it seems to have missed a picture or a message which we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , releases a content of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to extend the quite short original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immersed in the Mo@@ or@@ ish city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all the nature has gone and even the air has a commod@@ ity to watch the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her desire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reads , whose real name was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if this is not yet suspected of the text , that from Cameron stands , partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ film that is shown on the website of the Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air has a commod@@ ity , hop@@ ing a boy called T@@ ed to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he promised to be a pra@@ g@@ matic Father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron triggered the hand@@ lung of the book as little . here , an un@@ named young , like the local environment of the famous Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , strange , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task , deleg@@ ated to a Hel@@ per , who had not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s voting rights .
Super@@ Camps confirmed that the Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s staff was delivered , but there was no further Comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was also threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still hard
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the counter to see the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series is not on my map .
I won &apos;t finish a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly fewer than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing @-@ list , and the community is strong ; they will be able to bear no s@@ cars from 2012 , only a young and positive setting .
with the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test @-@ level , is an option for the attack .
text @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th separ@@ ates from the UK @-@ Test rig and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to leave out Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , who is hard to analyse .
at his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard turning is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are focused on results .
there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told them to choose their own best selection .
a long time ago , it was extended to the run of Ly@@ th , but it was the control of his own fate .
when it strikes hop@@ efully further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ising his attitude , even though he did not show so good achievements , and that was not surprised me ; he is especially a team of team .
the question how much time is a test stroke is to score his character , it is difficult .
LY@@ th received seven od@@ ds as Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton first received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only cra@@ ving that was able to rise first - Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite the Caribbean at first time - as Ly@@ th in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a stroke , whom I travel high .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ Player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire in early this season , when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same od@@ ds as the above before him , but this depends on the winning team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , mo@@ or next to Cook , suggest what would get an extra @-@ spin punch and four Qu@@ icks would be exchanged , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a banner can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already proved that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ l of Cri@@ cket tournaments .
Mo@@ een has perhaps not done his job for his County of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but it &apos;s a number 3 in her , and there is no difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests for the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ens in 2001 .
he made three hundred inst@@ in@@ us and did not look back .
Z@@ adi Ans@@ ari comes into the l@@ ader as an Back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited dealing with him he has greatly impressed me as a young man .
people possibly face his statistics on average 31 with ar@@ ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners that lift up their hands and the coach have chosen themselves for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
in addition to the crew , England made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ t from Sri Lanka , the advis@@ er to the test games could be a coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est fel@@ lows of the game , which bring an abundance of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a Coach , and how Mah@@ ela has in@@ sights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can be placed in the dressing room fresh breeze , even if the news in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ &apos;s Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot won a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and te@@ per@@ formers will not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as in the players , they will depend on the results .
such decisions won &apos;t hit a slight heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Ex@@ ce@@ eds Great Britain from the EU ) could lead to Zul@@ u , from which business until 2017 in an enclosure unit
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ issued new obj@@ ector strategy to keep the United Kingdom in the EU , with any day deeper into difficulties , even without the election of gen@@ ius Jeremy , &quot; it is Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who came to pass through Europe on Tu@@ esdays .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states , deeply under@@ lined in different cris@@ es , such as the EU is now and not always created from their own debt , Great Britain itself created Agenda with we@@ ary conc@@ essions and inter@@ rupt changes , which they often don &apos;t want are satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at their annual meeting that it does not like to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for re@@ forms .
it &apos;s always around me .
my European friend who wishes you to stay an outside Great Britain inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves much more brief cities and officials from some capit@@ als up to the point where it does not matter whether we remain or left .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally of ally , but she has left power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them as with the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated endurance test such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years old ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande wants to look at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also an ob@@ sol@@ ent force .
Poland probably has soon a national@@ istic right government , Spain has left a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a ban to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better , the Scottish exit from the UK - something that they do not want to separ@@ at@@ ist most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
therefore , some such ministers can &apos;t plan confi@@ denti@@ fied ann@@ ot@@ ations to speed up in the SN@@ P style while Great Britain &apos;s speech cont@@ em@@ agne 2017 to speed the Bre@@ x@@ it process , believes my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the re @-@ trial was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has nothing to gain from the action . &quot;
Europeans know how to burn the fle@@ et Street on their costs and what EU sk@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , however it didn &apos;t have happened during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
it is remin@@ is@@ cent of Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ Op@@ portun@@ ities who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Straight @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies .

the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ elec@@ tive shooting , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners and the pseud@@ o non @-@ In@@ come countries that have most of our large newspapers .
in fact , Tony ble@@ ach similar to them , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can make better ban@@ anas to make it possible , rather than to make lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air Himself , when he had turned his speech on Cam@@ er@@ ons , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle of the constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters during 2005 , which opened a back@@ door .
the press never stopped that .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly spl@@ ash on the back in Westminster . I said to him that he doesn &apos;t need more time for me - seems to have no time for me , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch . strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position is coming to Europe - I find it friendly - in development .
it says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps like traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ye tendency and the wild poultry from Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say about everyone to say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite , Ben@@ n in the radio and television that week , when the boy sc@@ outs , prov@@ oked by prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow firm , a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father ende@@ av@@ oured in television to be unable to go to his Labour cabinet , without too much and to lose his cabin crew .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle has even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ie print@@ out - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell answered , even what J@@ C told his competitors and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday night .
whatever makes the same @-@ one bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - think that it even touched me - News discipline will be important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and tre@@ ason .
it is right , Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to teach Lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ or campaign for self @-@ sensitivity , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell answered .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins doesn &apos;t think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s are basic animations for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ le@@ ung @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist discussion , is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion within the left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its multi@@ big@@ u@@ als , NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C has no campaign to be used for withdrawal - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to find in everything a sense of their pre@@ set at home .

experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded Agency that E @-@ cigarettes is less harmful as smoking as a result of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said scientists .
experts who write the British medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) signed themselves in the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the references of the Public Health England ( P@@ TO ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however some researchers have put the load capacity of the data and directed towards the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an article in the medical specialist magazine Lanc@@ et last month brought the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily pione@@ ering basis &quot; which he established its principal conclusion .
two further researchers writes about BM@@ J and we asked whether they are building up on the stone or the sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Relations at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epidem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expect@@ ation that &quot; the current estimates is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; to a detailed review of re@@ wise and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple @-@ criteria set analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to perform their opinions on the damage of different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were collected in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , said it .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to receive funding from a e @-@ cigarettes manufacturers , but not the financing that he will have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to have added them in advance by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but also include several well @-@ known electric @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also include a sector investment in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco use .
the managers also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands today that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the Pen@@ h Report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told us that &quot; the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he says &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims by BM@@ J .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smo@@ kers die in his view .
all evidence suggests that the health risk of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison is small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique commitment to the public about what is proof and what is not , especially when it gives so much public confusion over relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking the National Health Care costs € 2 billion a year .
with clear advantages of current account that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC Should add East@@ er@@ ders , a former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arms , &quot; for hit shows , like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the round radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs which are not broadcast by other UK transmitter .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for this public broadcast programmes , probably influenced by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmitters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson reported that he tried to come into contact with Channel 4 for six years in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sends it clearly by the un@@ conventional Ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under its investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio fee , what I do is medium or long term for a good idea , you should make its production at least on programs , which others do not do or put on order .
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class day window , because they want to achieve as possible wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show it is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is ri@@ di@@ zz@@ ling .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why it is a reg@@ res@@ sive tax contribution that could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is a such program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of your own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arms .
I &apos;m ill to see how this publicly @-@ tim@@ ely TV should be .
I do not believe that this would decrease the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC debt in the hunt for reviews &quot; was &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular properties of the BBC include those , which was the former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ en@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal framework programs &quot; to work in BB@@ C4 , but they fulfil their duties , and they may argu@@ ed if they have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ary missions , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ents that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window , where no one wanted to see it ever .
for the radio fee , Johnson told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system with respect to conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course you think all , think we all think you will receive a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who , for the £ 150 a lot of money is asking myself if that &apos;s true , because it consume not much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chief of David El@@ stein , who testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC proclaimed their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appro@@ ve and entert@@ ain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little bit of BBC @-@ production would now be classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example of the public @-@ legal television sen@@ ders in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown and with the commercial transmitters of alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes can change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have been bred wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified ner@@ ve systems that can be driven by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction of the moment in which they have a high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
im@@ pulses are generated by the power @-@ off of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to react to the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves .
more to this topic : researchers reading and write brain activity with light
the researchers told the power of a new method called Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , which can be used by ultr@@ asound in order to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells out of the body .
Srebrenica ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ de@@ ani , expl@@ orer at Sal@@ k institutes in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive process that gives electric im@@ pulses to treat people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
mer@@ ges are generally not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ de@@ ani states that they did so when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , it &apos;s out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasonic waves , which then penet@@ rating the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultr@@ asound models are based on structures that are known as TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the dig@@ nit@@ aries .
the sound waves prop@@ elled the opening of these icons and enable the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultra @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , modified chal@@ as@@ ani is genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ ions TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onic channels are possible .
when he uses ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ gl@@ are and pushed into the dig@@ s where they turn off the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a pione@@ ering tool , the scientists set to switch neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which has to be sent down to a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , the low frequency ultr@@ asound heads can happen unt@@ ill and can thus be sent into the brain from top on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that using Gen@@ etic and a therapeutic virus it is possible to pro@@ ving the deci@@ de@@ fied human neur@@ ons due to a clinical practice for certain Neu@@ rolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ de@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in a student halls
eleven years ago , I moved as self @-@ employed 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student house , still in faith at Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the requ@@ est@@ ed smile of those that I have prov@@ oked - and at the numerous , long@@ time complaints about others .
most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the train in a student halls reaches from slightly nerv@@ ous to absolute sho@@ ot@@ able .
it &apos;s loos@@ ening to che@@ er : people tell if you come from where and where you got the Sabbath year , where you say &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither do you hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it is only a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through by .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show more interest .
it re@@ cl@@ ed the conversation and helps you find people who like to figure out those who would not speak with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers are .
let people go .
the rooms of people are often turning into drinks @-@ recipes , film night venues and municipal branches , but they are also important places where people move and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related this : do not think about to start with a relationship with the university
Intro@@ duc@@ ted a rough treatment to the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room h@@ um@@ mel culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally can lead to life long friendship .
this may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship ar@@ ight , but you must go back to draw the energy that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
attempt to listen to when a comp@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and send it a SMS instead of t@@ apping .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s attached : do it .
one guy in my student halls had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship complete through che@@ ating .
since you start the Uni at the high point of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ aks of the doors of humans is to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , somewhat strange when the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have somewhat ch@@ op . so , and now please smile when I want to give you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made delic@@ at@@ eries are a good way to close friends .
their roomm@@ ates are obliged to maintain and maintain your face with a delicious b@@ surprise at the end .
naturally , it depends on if you are an exhau@@ sted b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat bring them to sleeping them when you ank@@ ook .
food to steal , constitutes an exceptional crime in residence halls .
of course , is the h@@ ens of h@@ ens , theft , but is it a drops of m@@ ps for your tea too ?
check out the S@@ ister sy@@ rup .
the chances are good to use themselves , even when they cook inside the inner .
if any one stories your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to go well @-@ balanced than my roomm@@ ates that di@@ lig@@ ently to prove th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , which keeps people from sleep or off work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only therefore to be an independent man , but that you belong to the tru@@ est sense of the saying which sit in the h@@ ash@@ out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl on my corridor asked their neighbours , if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass some qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they react to him with more and more music .
when she stopped at 5 o &apos; clock , she ran her neigh@@ bors only two hours before she left her own music , shut up her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it be not romantic when your future sp@@ ouse acci@@ dentally would move into the same student house ?
the other way , it would not be un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able , if you think a roomm@@ ates for your future sp@@ ouses in their way to spl@@ itting them again , and will be taken to see each day as they res@@ ume all common friends ?
of course , the heart is its own way - but if a hot contribut@@ or is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse in , try to talk to your under@@ taking a bit of understanding .
in the exc@@ itement moment in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ closed component , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing is lying when it seems .
a good streaming is funny , but it just takes moments , until he will catch the bridge .
share a valuable and am@@ ent@@ ant lesson about security - but never for@@ ge someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but drives her owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
tow@@ n@@ houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ers , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ters
the property contrac@@ tor Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on the Central European Central Ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
thus , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a budget , but also the mother &apos;s alone mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can still get and well @-@ known today , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are penet@@ rating the housing market .
business@@ man Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on how much cheaper residential space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ ded , many refugees are lost in the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus writes : the mass@@ acres of a cargo in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
due to the wealth of the refugee , we also need sufficient space for the next decades .
a very small , three @-@ storey building shed is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row House takes you on the f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different if people are sub@@ du@@ ed in blocks .
each of the six houses which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees can say , it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be converted slightly according to their requirements .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ das : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
that is reasonable .
did the regulations change their plans ?
Gil@@ adi@@ ums : I have implemented my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated and the subject of dam@@ aging a special construction and the slot compartment .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ stand@@ able , who created in one terra@@ ced house three apartments , needs at least 3 plots .
only in cities missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did they react to their terra@@ ced houses ?
Gil@@ das : there were those who were accused me to apply luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but are not spar@@ sely p@@ ens not the target campaign about paid apartments ?
Gil@@ ded : just today , in the last five years we were planning a construction boom in Germany , but the luxury apartments that can hardly be carried out .
my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother &apos;s alone mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ten@@ er .
I &apos;ll show how to make it cheap and well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS version , if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be challenged by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , you can download the phone to download and then install .
some are pushed out after the installation , as they get an error message to determine that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
in order to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is retri@@ eved or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create room - but Apple has made it more likely due to the ut@@ oring of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete apps once you have a special tool to set apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone was charged while updating is charged or located near a charger device , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not able to update the update , because the phone is possibly switches to a half way , and that it may lead to a breakdown of updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Fel@@ low@@ ausen and invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
in addition , Samuel Bor@@ mann , Economic Carri@@ age in U@@ ta S@@ eim @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ p , pays tribute to the Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
for many places in many places in the country , As@@ endorf claimed that Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in Stuttgart on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich , his successor in the next few months , is still half a site to the site .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then it is investing € 3@@ 10000 on the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at the first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her specialist training in the Golden hospital , which also wants to embar@@ k in practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and laugh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was come , I called it easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple had the idea to put his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the close @-@ up and the constant contact to the patients are very attractive , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to learn and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one was united , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family , Frank Müller was also grew up in Hannover , followed by his medical studies in Hannover , followed by several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ châ@@ tel and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a veter@@ in@@ arian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head office in Di@@ ep@@ wood . volunteers are working on the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the new boss will be prepared for the new boss .
during the sur@@ geon of Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ic@@ ausen as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his wife is speci@@ alizing in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) on Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the W@@ aste , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to in@@ clin@@ ched themselves as hom@@ e@@ ologists .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern look like .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound investigations , as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ up EK@@ GS , and need a microphone space more .
furthermore the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
as part of a funding programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality of the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the tr@@ ash@@ ers get a total of 50,000 euros .
&quot; it shows how proud and joy@@ ful we are that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises the company &apos;s idea by Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2,000 patients have been identified by Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter in the field of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , in the North German Average practice there are around 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice .
a positive side effect of the practice transfer by Frank Müller : the Phar@@ m@@ acy continues to be an Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no followers could have found , she would have gone .
he who visited m@@ iller &apos;s speech is well @-@ looking , especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock face .
with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf there was a era , after all this medical profession had practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
a little bit of clay , they sp@@ ic@@ ure them after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ oj@@ or and many patients are safe still often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I pressed always before gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border controls can also be reached at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister for Jo@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are kept at the Hungarian border parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum request , will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of men stands in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
humans must know that we do not accept borders of mig@@ r@@ ations@@ through , not through the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia re@@ ject
the Croatian government previously reported that Slovenia would take up foreign refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and are also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
quite such this was the interior of the Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ nig f@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach , however .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary .
however , the border with Croatia is as an overall bound@@ ary of the Schengen area , by contrast , on the other hand .
as the Minister has stressed , Sloven@@ es will not cover its borders for refugees but doesn &apos;t work .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations ; otherwise the system does not function , &quot; stressed the Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government over@@ took the first refugees in the night hours to Tuesday in Ost@@ c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID in order to sof@@ ten the registration .
the Croatian police could impos@@ e them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars continuously meet with new refugees .
it mainly refers to sy@@ past@@ or and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country received some 4,000 refugees , and the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , busses leave from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serb border , who had brought mig@@ rating to Hungarian border so far , reported Croatian and Serb media on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade , however , believes that it should be wise , must hit certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor do we want to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian Border at S@@ ID , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the route all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary had only eight , so the police said that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to go to Germany in Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually be the predicted shift in the former Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia and Hungary to a little way to the west side of the past .
Croatia : &quot; extensive ways to limit control &quot;
in Croatia &apos;s interior minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ised that his country have prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not know details , but he pointed out that Croatia could become a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options on limit control . &quot;
one . perform str@@ ingent checks in order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ esis .
Slovenia has been part of the EU partners since 2007 , since then we had a good report on the country , concerning the standard of border controls .
there are some 300 refugees closely involved on the Hungarian border of the Hungarian border .
according to media reports , she could have spent the past night at the hor@@ g@@ os border , which led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities the two mar@@ g@@ os and back@@ pack@@ ets continue to remain closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to pass on Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was even more calm at a local time in Hor@@ g@@ os : he is the debate on alternatives to refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
currently it would not be extremely high concern .
it could not say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or other country .
hel@@ pers , migrants to - hazardous to alternatives
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees to the refugees , on which alternative routes were drawn through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ space was sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex covers dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ gig@@ ant expanded its profit views over a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his goods transport service .
the company also said that she is planning to present about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at that time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told us to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next month at 20 p@@ enny less than in previous predi@@ ctions .
an@@ alysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the less view goes on average , despite the price increases , aver@@ aged 4.9 percent and on January 4 and despite higher supplements for bo@@ d@@ ding goods by heavy and large packages that will be charged from November .
the company said that it is nevertheless expecting to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company will be able to generate strong yields , especially in manufacturing and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade .
the plans for the holiday @-@ employment have been announced a day later by the Ri@@ vals UPS , which plan to stop 9@@ 0,000 - 9@@ 5,000 additional jobs , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the $ 2.@@ 44 $ per share , conducted by T@@ acks Investment Research and an@@ alysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.2 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks question@@ ed the expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has given a decline in international priority , which resulted in sales in his unit Express Shipping delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of the goods transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result for higher labor costs decreased .
at the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed Ex @-@ shares fell by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tu@@ esdays , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on the most awa@@ ited conference in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spent two days this week at a 27 @-@ foot @-@ à @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the leading position for the first time since almost a decade .
threatened with them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting room , there is a mur@@ al picture of the United States .
the card is rec@@ alled that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues &apos; represents the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold commission from the Congress : maxim@@ ize the U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mand@@ at : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too close to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented arrival rate by the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets might already increase this meas@@ ur@@ acy due to increase of interest for Bundes@@ an@@ ings - and it is also just around one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important thing in what they are , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economic at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when searching for a pre@@ text , it is not to raise the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty in the global market enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is doing what to compl@@ ain about the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows a 30 % chance to raise an increase .
this indicates a drop of the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists are mil@@ it@@ ened the blow by decl@@ aring another increase far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average re@@ j@@ ump@@ ed by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy stops the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ sky told the Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at this point , &quot; he said .
if they do it , you would have to go far into their declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t come across pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest increase in financial markets would ass@@ ure because they would act un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act to eliminate .
one month later , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence to 0.25 percentage points per month , the first step in a slow sh@@ aking of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level , which the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
pay@@ roll conclusions have shown mark of a recovery .
and although inflation was constant among the 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but financial markets throughout the world came together at the end of the last month after China had appropri@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average &apos;s worth fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would ro@@ g global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow has now reached by nearly 10 % below the 5th of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market tur@@ mo@@ il impact the complex calculation , when you should increase interest .
&quot; if the events occurred on financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. exp@@ bank .
now he says that they would wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty in what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main interests of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be included technically in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final aspect , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous within the past few years .
the mere Not@@ ice of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ ward in 2013 that the F@@ ed could restri@@ cts its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dissolved the tur@@ bul@@ ations around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where the markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly disp@@ ers@@ ed , the F@@ ed representative are expected to closely monitor the developments of other locations but also with other central banks and experts will advise you to obtain better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as Science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Business Management , En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story about re@@ inter@@ actions on financial market movements that linked to the economic foundation stone . &quot;
l@@ acker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets up interest in interest rates , cited all decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its leading role of 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite lim@@ it@@ ably recogni@@ z@@ able effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives started to re@@ vo@@ ke these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only set the financial stability of the financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market place in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il are not near the level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely I will not come to the situation in which she was afraid of a bet , because the markets emerged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act nonetheless doesn &apos;t contain the twice mandate and mentioned the financial stability , and which is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should take advantage of the time .

of course , quite different classes are considered as at a real school .
Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy growing
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy how important good food during the feeding time is . you do this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which painted to breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy eating .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all the nutrients which they need to build a strong immune system .
thanks to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ ical adaptation to the mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet was really aff@@ ecting the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , any healthy diet of the child impact the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal company Bern@@ ward appro@@ ached the building contract for the 2.3 million euro building gym .
and he was an exception .
the roof may become flat@@ ter for the solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ wing gym at the Bern@@ rie@@ fing gym is by step forward by step forward : in the youngest prin@@ cess@@ ation , the revised building application was blessed without big discussions .
in addition , the panel submitted a request to an additional statutory law on the basis of a &quot; respect &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is supposed to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sem@@ it@@ at@@ ching roof with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background of planning , the planned use of roof area for solar plants : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderful large south @-@ roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in their meeting .
with the &quot; Liberation &quot; the upper part of the roof , which was prescribed for energet@@ ic reasons - it is also stated otherwise than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore advised , because the development plan is not subject to a &quot; exceptions . &quot; the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at usually goes only restri@@ ctive from the liberation range .
however , the turn@@ around is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create precision , &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the turn@@ around at the Sports Center is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
at a cost of approximately 2,3 million euros are calculated .
supplements are expected by the school and lat@@ itude transport .
in the next procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ chet to test the test .

at present there are a short @-@ time care for Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better was not happen to happen , such an opportunity does not return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer has received a positive and very intelli@@ gible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move on the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and under@@ stand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns before housing
the situation on the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
even more refugees seek a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution competition on the German housing market has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more people are getting on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with ease of income for the final paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units have to be built until 2020 .
this result represents a study on behalf of the group of social housing . &quot;
by comparison : this year there will be 26@@ 0,000 units sold in Germany .
this offers 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees who are not obliged to live in the first three months of their stay when asylum seek@@ ers in an initial shelter .
many wa@@ its across the houses of the houses and rows in front of the apartments in front of the apartments .
however , according to the Federal German Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only rising to rising refugees .
the study also makes considerable is@@ sions within housing policy of the last years .
Germany Sli@@ de is a property deficit which is bigger from year to year .
at the moment , Matthias Günther has already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains : Matthias Günther , author of the study .
so many prof@@ essions stayed in large cities to have not@@ ran@@ ties in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ will@@ ingly at the property market to stay free in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
the number of square meters per head in major cities dropped to the first time in the last years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Buil@@ dings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incenti@@ ves are to boost the social housing .
the property tax will be disp@@ enses with the property and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed flats has to be carried out .
an attractive tax write @-@ ti@@ zation can be necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding range for refugees from the Kf@@ W state bank is now good at cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , on Monday evening at 184 million euros , more than half of the vehicles were already sold .
this project might even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia with a corridor
after Hungary it is practically no way going on , there are more refugees crossing the way about Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the passage through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les to request .
the route is but dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior woman , and when it &apos;s necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the edge of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television news coverage .
on the day of the day , Hungary had sealed its borders for refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , over@@ flow the regular asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can pass through and we prepare for this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
people are people who wanted to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police captured the first refugees at the Serbia border in Croatia on the morning .
most origin@@ ate media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they were both by bus and tax@@ is as well as for Tax@@ es in the Serbian language of S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees d@@ ont stuck on the bound@@ ary .
the border @-@ strip has different d@@ angers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mini @-@ spatial as well as possible to create a secure passage .
no more refugees came to Hungary after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police cleared out 366 times .
just before the end of the circuit on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the Over@@ coming and Damage to the Border Guard as perpet@@ rators .
therefore , 35 criminal cases were introduced in the southern Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eged .
they are sentenced to five years of imprisonment on trial pen@@ alties and deportation .
according to the immig@@ ration authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers met on Tuesday in the new established &quot; Trans@@ ition &quot; limit , almost all of them are - 93 - the major transition .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with small children and two older people are .
on Wednesday morning , some 40 refugees would have stopped .
that is , however , no one has granted a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers shall be deported there .
a few hundred refugees assembled in front of the &quot; Trans@@ figuration &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began to set up workers .
they gathered a litter which left tens of thousands of people during the past few weeks .
flood grid were min@@ ed and was re@@ mod@@ elled into the bound@@ ary rock .
no one wanted to express itself for the target of this building .
in Austria , a few million refugees arrive after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still alive in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people wait for the further trip to Germany .
the train service to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities in the morning .
in the ground you met regularly smaller groups of refugees too ft .
mayor of the Stri@@ ped &quot; above the border
&quot; we were close to the bridge on Sunday with the dreams , when suddenly there were ten people with rice off@@ ences at the entrance of the tent , &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany ended on Sunday , however , because of the refugee @-@ est@@ rogen the railway traffic with Austria was sur@@ pris@@ ingly ended , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and the ran together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Middle Pass@@ au .
first , we had the hop@@ eful guests first to be ro@@ asted , with snack and drink .
we said it right , we &apos;ll get them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was of course , of course , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to hand a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very pleased , &quot; he is a city of Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train failed on Sunday evening in Wels , followed by a ICE train towards Pass@@ au , in order to follow shortly after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still attempts to try .
the regional train was completed in front of the Ch@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the border @-@ exceeding high in the course .
the bridge @-@ permanently association with the Bavarian neighbours must be soci@@ able on Sunday , at the first day a branch attempt - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
so Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke warehouse , immediately in order to help organization of structures , our ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has officially put up our ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or to the position of Hungarian Nazis in the Dun@@ st@@ ony of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ carrying this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ aries with cha@@ otic states .
the poultry people also have to realize that the &quot; yellow land &quot; which they invited us and welcome is nothing but a further refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge in view of the persistent refugee streams and the coming winter , de@@ cent of de@@ cent concerning the seek@@ ers .
and there will be one more major - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on search of 35.000 for prof@@ esi@@ ve quartz
Konrad has filled all hands to a refugee with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ ust@@ omed to have his word &apos;s weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to present qu@@ arti@@ facts for thousands of refugees .
at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Technical Centre , Konrad has already purchased the chaos within the Balk@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had no homeless more in carrying congregations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was taken without major economic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inside of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; ky situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad Adenauer has a total demand of 8@@ 5,000 quartz varieties in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet the number of dollars , over the next few weeks , 35,000 units must be found - 20,000 are to prepare the country , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a ass without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he performed talks with the state capit@@ als .
this constituted him to ourselves , even for the coming refugees in quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , so it will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations of the As@@ ylum coordinator also in the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ping , &quot; as we are . &quot;
platform can offer individuals and un@@ complicated accommodations on the platform .
in addition , this is hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standards yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in not@@ eb@@ ase it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must specify a certain height of the hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ holder or size of the tor@@ ches .
for a temporary time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered .
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior in the case of a successful conclusion , Konrad began with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an who does not say without doubt the sense of truth .
re@@ generating capacity is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the republic no costs , as they declared themselves .
their number of employees will increase to three to four .
the own quarters were not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz in office .
nevertheless there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
no opening of city sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center to arrange refugees planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary since the data subject are currently allowed to place without these measures , says Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
for an emergency , further locations are to be checked for their rop@@ or@@ ality .
critic@@ isms covered by the authorities in the breakdown of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also aff@@ ord its contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone conversation with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) was dra@@ fted for the further advance of the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has covered me that the German limits will not be sealed .
many of the immig@@ ration of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany still possible .
but the respective border controls is there .
special trains with refugees to Germany will be no longer available .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought with regular journeys to Germany .
by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger had also asked more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria therefore also leads to its borders again to its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical episode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the fore@@ head of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz Europe line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production buildings the foundation of the IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is expected to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in the IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
it could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard and later also to acquire it .
at the beginning of the S &amp; T he wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - there are some things promises : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
from S &amp; T invested in the site , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is part of a third of the city of Linz , Austria , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is controlled by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ B@@ ags are in the center .
in fact , Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to become a dog .
this project had to temporarily slide the 49 year old bearer of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the bar@@ ben@@ ches market : finally , she now has gained an increase in the form of a further business environment .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they are sold under different bags , suitcase , shoes and ra@@ ckets of different manufacturers , all around the Fur@@ la , stock exchange are now available for 75 euros .
large bags and accessories will cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago was re@@ mod@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I long consider that I would open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , had the idea of a site in Bologna , where only their hand@@ bags are sold , have been taken .
&quot; we are the only one in the greater area of Linz , which sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who themselves have Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been put in the cra@@ dle of her mother in her mother &apos;s cra@@ dle .
me most , if something developed and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why some woman in the view of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , can also answer the woman with the last security .
perhaps it is about to use a beautiful bag of each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ ish
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature combines some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president of the United States .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ itement .
whether he ex@@ presses foreign ac@@ count@@ ants , journalists Rü@@ de is concerned , or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential campaign is in charge for the election campaign .
and accepts it well .
this is also registered in the Spanish district of K@@ all@@ ise where the grand@@ parents of the real estate company h@@ erst@@ alike .
the New York with the we@@ dge is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
only 1200 people is related to him in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ ort in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ ant Simone Wen@@ del turned into a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what are the vill@@ agers about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow find the somehow wei@@ rd , but in their K@@ all@@ &apos;@@ stad@@ ter Art , there are also not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has turned a am@@ using documentary on the place and his famous spro@@ uts , including Tr@@ ump also belongs to the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for f@@ isheries , comes into &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ ort &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would be successful , if he would live in K@@ all@@ ish .
he has not brought them to the king of the heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also to ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a little dra@@ g@@ out , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; acci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ ort in the Vic@@ inity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ag@@ ator .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and in the USA opened a locomotive for gold dig@@ gers .
foundation of the real estate company were the first real estate in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home to home , f@@ ails to the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not accept Tr@@ ump , because he once was cancelled without homologation , the Director of the Institute of Cr@@ itic &apos;s History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explains the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
that is in contrast to the co @-@ stated statements of the night .
the had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immig@@ rants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall required to emig@@ rate illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the polar , is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote family of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; Die O@@ MA was a born horse ump , the Op@@ a was bor@@ row@@ ed Heinz &apos; ) .
retired from the v@@ int@@ ners in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced , &quot; it &apos;s always about five thousand . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump comes alive ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never has p@@ aired by K@@ all@@ ish . &quot;

the new drama on a recent ha@@ w@@ ed father , who joins itself with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics asked that Thomson could bear a solo show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the results of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in evening two by The Chase Australia .
the first half an hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz Show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe showed an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .

the last three agree : Bachelor and Wood is the perfect man - who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly dis@@ worked , who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was finally hung up in the worst mystery .
nor of the three remaining girls , there will certainly not be cheaper if it is the one who received the last rose .
but when we launched with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming from three two , you possibly have a notice given to those who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds its lips up to the Fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women have left over the ly@@ ric way , why Wood is the perfect man and they called his mind for hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family properties and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to have its partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should become the gh@@ ost Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could become their answers to the gameplay , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki are both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood joined one simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment , when I went to the house and told Sam@@ i &apos;s energies it felt that they felt quite compatible , and I have thought it all over the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with two feet on earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added aw@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they would be perfect for Sam Wood as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ keeping her last week had her clear that Wood &quot; who could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; when I saw him with my friends and my family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already waiting for him , &quot; she said .
and when asked , who was going to choose who Wood , then it was dead .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love those left girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on top ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 a.m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
in Detroit and Seattle , we showed great interest according to their re@@ location to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent out after his impressive performance day at the end of the last year .

Tom@@ s@@ ula also showed his real face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies , they encouraged and encouraged the mill to the mill .
in his press conference , Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened himself in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encour@@ aging from Special e@@ ams Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who was trying to forget his pat@@ ron@@ aut catch and take care of the next game .

it certainly was not the start to make Hay@@ ne and its massive Australia @-@ fol@@ ds for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field and told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 after that he could not imagine a wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that is coming , it takes care of the next game , and that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne participated the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Origin in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore more than 50 new asylum procedures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I also need more personnel for administrative sk@@ ill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FW @-@ CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistently participating : &quot; we would need to meet a unified standards for federal states . &quot;

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen rubber handles on demonstr@@ ators shoot in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the Southern Nepal after demonstr@@ ating the police forces in a crowd fired against the proposed new constitution , officials said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ con@@ i district , 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of District Invest@@ ig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered from a police station , some of them cast stones and burnt @-@ bombs .
M@@ R Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have been deployed to the air and shot up into the air before moving to rub@@ bers on rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were viol@@ ated , he said .
it was not clear why the , mig@@ rating floors , known from which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less foolish alternative , apparently a high death rate produced .
the strug@@ gles was the last in weeks violent protest in Nepal known as the southern levels where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say that new provinces , which were formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would decrease its political influence .
there was also protests in the western Nepal created by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to state a State .
a minimum of 40 people including 11 police officers , were in violent conflict since the 10th .
in August , when the four big political parties signed an agreement signed the country in the provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al topic in Nepal , which was centrally located .

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily left diabet@@ ics , weight loss can be helpful .
after a recent study , the advantages of pre @-@ loss sur@@ ge@@ ons with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is too early to say if easily out@@ overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer living than those who do not surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss period , which wrote a guide to the new trial in J@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss treatment or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to consume food .
for the years , obes@@ ity operations have proven as efficiently as efficient , but most of the trials were conducted in people using a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obes@@ ity and stomach dis@@ closure - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the average BMI of those who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who do not surgical treatments received approximately equally at 29 .
among those who under@@ took part in a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes is completely destroyed and 28 % in part .
compared to the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely consolidated in comparison to one percent in comparison with only around two percent .
in addition , the results were performed in the controls in the blood pressure , the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found .
the researchers also super@@ vised the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood gl@@ ucose levels in time of time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , thus the leading researchers of Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also represents an average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass project group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and greater losses in BMI ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete distribution of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden , causing operation for longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who under@@ go a obes@@ ity operation , some 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group receiving conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for the survival in the surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone said to be interested in individuals with a BMI below 35 individuals who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI Group , &quot; without an elevated risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient lies with their BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for a long time , until we bring people to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , associated with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a return is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that has also been found in fiction : a young woman , too popular and in@@ acci@@ dentally , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this one loves them .
as a recent publication , we are not so &quot; of Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
in addition to its love story , the novel should be interesting for H@@ uns@@ re@@ er readers , for he plays in long we@@ iler and the surrounding areas .
the Swedish author grew up in Lang@@ we@@ iler and is pleased to announce that she was a literary monument in her home country .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about it , as the killing in their countries is decreased .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s in accordance with the terrorist attack on September 11 and exhibited that the violent reaction of the USA moved to a chain of un@@ controlled events after the terrorist attacks .
after September 11 , I expressed my supplement in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he prevailed , and that did great consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a four @-@ time increase in flight @-@ disinfection by children from the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the USA reports a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in children under 12 years that strongly swal@@ low impacts - Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand @-@ disinfection is reported to children under 12 years of age , amounting to 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are often more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go through Not@@ ices , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children disinfect@@ ants are deliber@@ ately drinking , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ il@@ sample at the social media .
show videos on YouTube how te@@ ens disinfect@@ ants only drink only because of a budget experience .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be so@@ ared from attractive cases of disinfect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ li@@ zed .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ anges , which are very attractive for children .
pendant disinfection contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with infants may already run a few spl@@ ashes to the alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ ist Centre at the Hospital of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children are coming , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four syr@@ ing@@ es from after straw@@ berry smell @-@ disinfection at school was taken into a emergency recovery .
her blood @-@ alcohol con@@ concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is valid for adults by law , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sm@@ iling her words , and was not able to go into the situation when she arrived in the emergency intake .
doctors super@@ vised it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had caught the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very fri@@ gh@@ tened , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection items for use and hand@@ cra@@ y@@ detection in outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some disinfect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario women have died after the swal@@ lowing of pendant , po@@ ison@@ ous , non @-@ proclaimed ingredient .
employees of health authorities ad@@ mits that the product me@@ thanol contained , a dead@@ ly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been listed as active ingredient .
in January , he planned three students of the fourth class in New York City , to &apos; for@@ &apos; ma@@ ison@@ ous men by sending anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , as a police report reports .
the teacher is highly allergic against slopes @-@ disinfection and utterly destroyed them from their room .

there are rum@@ ors of dis@@ cord at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control because they prepare for the con@@ front@@ ation with the Dutch table leaders .
I don &apos;t think we feel at trouble when I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bo@@ red Dutch nationals - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ Mittel@@ stand and former National Player of The Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ ger .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games , and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger is not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and this is what they were interested .
there is a lot of voltage in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland that want to see these games .
I will turn all things off , swear by D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Cel@@ tic must have war , but the Norwegian writer s@@ ware to re@@ turn things .

&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had ever bad days , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel that right so - but we don &apos;t have to go on .
we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
now working together is so important .

why I will be a hang@@ ings in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it wasn &apos;t done , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked to have voted .
when the day approaching , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the entire story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and there often more applications are available as places available , a spot@@ less lot@@ tery runs to decide to choose who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , it will observe it emotional .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of very friend , with which I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone reservations and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh at much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to act a not@@ ebook and a pen to capture what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , accused me of giving my im@@ part@@ n@@ ness to Twitter .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the det@@ ain@@ ees as he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about it .
she dre@@ amed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still think that it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it if he would do it .
I told him that he can quickly remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants that an international repor@@ ter will be present in order to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the relation of the movement against death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the Pod@@ casts series that I made .
I will not want to go back here again to all details .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is un@@ guilty .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a prefer@@ ential death .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I think that its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him .
I can not claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
other repor@@ ters will give you to that you can apply .
what you &apos;ll get from me is what it means to die a man &apos;s un@@ necessary death .
man to mo@@ ist police persecution will be persu@@ aded , coming from the C@@ anning River

&quot; sometimes people do fun things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moody claims that the st@@ ew@@ ards tried to dis@@ sap@@ ear him and threatened to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of racing Victoria have attempted to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to finish the race at once .
he focused on the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m at Wednesday .
Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went for the positive co@@ b@@ alt test sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
it was held 18 months because of the sp@@ y @-@ down charges , and didn &apos;t want to see it as too high fat . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything to it , and I have long to eat it , but sometimes you &apos;re fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at a time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there is far more .
sometimes man re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with them what I said .
I am going to go home today and sleep well .
I would like to be up@@ lifted and I want to think that my owners think I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moody &apos;s awarded the bomb during an interview with rac@@ ing.com in having been attemp@@ ting to penet@@ rate the Department of the Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen years , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m thinking - and gave him a employment in my st@@ ables , to provide information about what I do within my livestock , &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com .
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly should contain their n@@ oses , because it has failed to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ le@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ die , American President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ ab , current CEO of Route L , were now aware of this .
should I take a look at that , that it is personally done ?
does the RUF continue to melt , and perhaps people outside of the train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there I am .
perhaps they don &apos;t have to take my license and spur@@ ned on , and I don &apos;t doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point , on which there is no matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sor@@ row@@ ful .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and make them a decision to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ levels of the train@@ ers boast over the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching lead to him that he could carry out his license on the table . &quot;
Moody &apos;s , best known for his preparation of the free champion Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay on the horse &apos;s debate has been worn out against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff was ron@@ e@@ ously deposited into the ban . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this evening could be so .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , so what was that way .
but it had so on the race day .
Moody could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but you have gone too far , &quot; then Moody &apos;s .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against Ri@@ vals for cont@@ ests of ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy created criticism of the Tac@@ kling wine from his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League from the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator gave the Storm game player &quot; Ring@@ ve &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner &apos;s qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a scar@@ ed note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ ai def@@ ended the tor@@ so @-@ lim@@ bs of his team and said that she is lean from Tac@@ kling only on her &quot; contact &quot; .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree to agree that they may become wor@@ ried about the defeat of the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always back on - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring combat , when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive system or techniques in the last six weeks . however , during the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a true main focus and that &apos;s the trend towards us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he probably is probably not to lose it , so it was a little a shock for him .
it is funny as this is already immersed in this season .
Bell@@ amy released Benn@@ ett idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds us of his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ z@@ ra Dra@@ gons took the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ lasting &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he sang his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember the year 2010 St George when a bor@@ ing team was critic@@ ised , and Wayne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that can play and which we can watch as exciting , in particular his young players with her speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this .
I build trust in confidence , because they say these things , because they &apos;re wor@@ ried about to play against us .
six weeks ago she did not think of us as it went about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm is set up a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks even and do not have any points ?
there are the plans for me .
when it men@@ tioning us , it means that we will still meet at one stage yet .
the Storm team is free at this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next week morning .
Serbia offering $ 200.000 damages according to drug an@@ kl@@ age
a man who may have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence against his temp@@ ting , in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which had been lubric@@ ated to Que@@ ens@@ land , has been released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the police allowed 100 kg of the threat to the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he had his co @-@ def@@ endants in the afternoon and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of dro@@ ge in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the advoc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the Café , could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was wor@@ ried about the threat of mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared himself on Wednesday .
in the case of the criminal case he was lied to the police on his position .
at Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ eable mother and father , a deposit of 200,000 dollars had been offered as security in common to release his release .
&quot; after reading the enthusi@@ astic asser@@ tion of the two persons it is clear that the circulation represents a maximum of 200,000 dollars a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan .
but the alone will not be sufficient to hold it out of it , he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail @-@ release , under the terms that he left his Australian and his Serb pass , on the police open every day and sat at a bas@@ eline from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

this mass makes it : every two years the automobile show will show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact car is mainly used for compact cars , which currently sell very well .
cars from the compact class are currently being asked : some 28,@@ 1 percent of the new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment alone .
this is reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 - 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , who will stand at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the nu@@ cle@@ us of the brand .
the volume @-@ volume is also well sold , the new Astra needs to be much more expensive for this .
Opel is a starting point of the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf in Vista , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 990 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse range further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp , which includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
the Opel Astra are just one of the main competitors , the Opel Astra and Ford Focus .
a second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA .
and what about the Astra at the IAA was still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its Astra &apos;s competitors in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and one under@@ lines the sporty GT version .
in the trade marks the beginning of next year , then also as com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan agreement wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
for this reason , the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line with its de@@ w@@ ed lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .

in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a range of trans@@ missions and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former member of the Criminal Tribunal for Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months in months .
because of the violation of human dig@@ nity , the prisoners are entitled to compens@@ ate for financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
the data subject could even hope for money , if they were only imprisoned in their narrow spaces only a few days were imprisoned ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was a former former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell composed in the prison quarters of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , in a single cell with approximately five square meter floor space ; the toilet was not separated from the room .
then the man , who , according to his att@@ ainment is now again located on the free foot , has been transferred to a bigger cell .
his official liability because of the allow@@ able adh@@ esion conditions against the Land of Berlin fail .
but the Constitutional Court holds the verdict of the Chamber of Berlin and presented the case to renew the trial there .
they viol@@ ated the human dig@@ nity of the man .
Chamber court decides about the amount of compensation
even if a few days in frag@@ ile period only a few days will be decisive for compensation , a compensation committee was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cat@@ astrophe of the right protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce must now clari@@ fy the amount of the money im@@ bur@@ sed .
the constitutional law have already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only said in April a det@@ ain@@ ee compensation , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to the decision of 2011 , human error is also the multi @-@ sensitivity of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition , on Wednesday , also on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 , had a de@@ cent accommodation .
the as@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was held over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell that was in the Kar@@ ls Court .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also lost due to lack of staff in the last weeks due to lack of staff .
cap@@ tives will therefore always be kept for 23 hours , the aggressive touch of it , even by h@@ unter , it should already be met because of the already stressed position .
according to information from the Just@@ iz@@ pres@@ sec@@ t , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young lack of young lack , 19 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy said : &quot; we are creating &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what to do in Germany ?
according to proj@@ ections , according to proj@@ ections of the Federal Ministry of Health , Germany comes to Germany in this year , according to statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this , and we are creating this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as to Germany comes , gives the following overview .
it is needed , according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) Apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but especially at paid rental rates : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out from the rental price , and in order to apply these especially favourable apartments .
Federal Minister for Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion at which at the moment 518 million amounts to one billion euros .
a lot of too little is that of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social buildings have to be built annually and in order to invest € 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs are that there are also more tax advantages for investments in residential buildings .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany may be employed in the long term .
however , Refu@@ ge@@ es were not involved in Germany at all times , in order to help them for the entrance , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
working be the key to social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the application @-@ season , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rant , says mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ et@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ust publishes a political shift : the for@@ b@@ ade of refugees for the recognition of labour .
while it was previously a working for@@ b@@ ade for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces , to apply the asylum seek@@ ers to a place .
in society , due to a failure - mainly due to the coun@@ c@@ apping - a majority of vision should be achieved that refugees quickly reach the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German language skills .
there are currently no extension of the offer available on general and professional language courses .
research shows that jobs are most often convey@@ ed through personal contacts .
therefore the setup of networks is therefore re@@ integration of the König@@ s@@ weg in the monarchy .
the Berlin School management has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents gave their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only very important to join the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ew@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate department .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management board has been selected in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rising rapidly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to considerably increase the training capacity - for example , visiting more professional schools .
students without speaking knowledge are prepared to attend classes in classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by teachers participating teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as in Berlin , even by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ool from the Berlin School Management .
the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land of asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ ates the study - the only exception was to date Berlin , inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has however raised its position now .
students may also be facilit@@ ated by the university &apos;s access to the university .
because refugees with a residence or Dul@@ ce do not get any achievements after the asylum seek@@ ers .
the latter is generally not a wafer , as they do not fall below the section of the b@@ af@@ ore@@ mentioned people .
Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible to serve B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this span declined to 15 months .
however , this funding bridge must also be closed , after Steffen Schröder , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Karlsruhe student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will under@@ go a major role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely obtain the same rights as they have the churches and to develop the existing State @-@ Churches @-@ right to a new state @-@ religi@@ ons ratio .
it is important that the establishment of a Islamic pro@@ sper@@ ity has been chosen professional to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also involved .
so the representative of Islam will need to agree to clear contact with some and willing to coinci@@ de with the state in many fields and to grant certain control options .
it also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness , to cause against religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed the concern of the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered after Germany too .
those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said he in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue in the future much more than today a theme throughout the whole society .
in order to change the majority society , the dis@@ continu@@ ity of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ gent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a decade , anti @-@ discrimination and an acc@@ us@@ ation law .
but it gets very slow as the NSU race series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive will be systematically igno@@ red .
same od@@ ds for all : what Mig@@ rant organizations and those stak@@ eholder groups , non @-@ white German , have to demand for the coming years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should ever use their possibilities - as well as to the benefit of all citizens .
generally , Germany made it possible to medical profession until now , the doctors president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Man@@ - Power and Capacities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we succeed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the daily level of view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however extra money has to flow to the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery demand , for all deriv@@ atives , with the registration of health species .
the achievements could be anticipated later with the federal states .
and long term it be highly question@@ able to see so many people with the restricted service catalog to see the applic@@ ants of the law .
otherwise , the doctors make to make the language bar@@ ri@@ ers .
as far as so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ den has demonstrated , Mig@@ rants has been clari@@ fied about their disease as other patients .
not only in clinics , as well as medical practices would have to be taken over .
many refugees were assisted too many more gener@@ alized medical an@@ in@@ ances in emergency days .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are much more un@@ treated people under refugee children , and with the yo@@ ungst@@ ers there are about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
in some other cases , German doctors proce@@ eded from their apprenti@@ ces@@ hip as a clear , the Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite di@@ arr@@ he@@ a or tuber@@ culosis are not so hard to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what the doctors fear@@ ing that through the refugees , it is maybe even a path in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees see even doctors .
in order to be pract@@ ised , however , they would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ red any further ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees next to Germany is psych@@ ically ill after estimates of the Federal College of Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ically : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , refugee children will be concerned , says Dietrich Am@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by the TU Munich published that every fifth Syrian refugee camp in Germany is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
the strength of a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is , amongst others , is suffering from the so @-@ called flash@@ back , di@@ zz@@ iness , cor@@ di@@ ly , and death k@@ ills .
other symptoms are ins@@ ens@@ ing and concentration disorders , strong scre@@ am and emotional feeling .
in order to avoid that the symptoms were chronic , a early treatment declared , Mun@@ z declared .
however only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ic dise@@ ased asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for a psycho@@ therapy in the social posts , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , individuals or doctors who have not trained psych@@ ologists who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe keeps wrong speech in the Parliament
M@@ R Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leaders , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is available up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to manufacture 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings in the company &apos;s services .
today , HP will split into two listed companies and the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job analysis lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ person , and Chief Executive , which should lead the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes less and more focused than the HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies at transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing requirements of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US @-@ Dollars and &quot; will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard . Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed the Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if its rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play ever before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games in England and in the presence of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere was heavily damaged after a separate sw@@ ing@@ le viol@@ ation and then returned to his old weak@@ ening during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
there is a man who didn &apos;t heal him .
that is not a matter .
this was just an accident .
he didn &apos;t stand in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es , or with the injuries that He had before .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it is also developing an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd submitted 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 league games in the last five playing times .
the wider picture of the ar@@ senal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs were , which recorded the most significant number of vulner@@ able days .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the risk of injury during the last season has lasted .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from a breach , you have a fr@@ aud period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and fight violence , &quot; W@@ enger has said .
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I &apos;m optim@@ istic that he will do it and he is going through a career of this type that he deserv@@ es .
Arsenal will begin his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the Play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ gauge at the next Wednesday , and W@@ enger proves to be one rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ tat Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are bo@@ ther@@ ed .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier T@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ si@@ o and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and the player who needs to gain a little bre@@ ather break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the game grounds with the largest event effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the final season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake followed at the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is aware that Arsenal had drawn the lesson of the past season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains committed from the far hope to lead the association with its first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it never didn &apos;t work with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the store to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are no dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that serious lessons with serious classes are given to us
lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in mind how to open the need for men who is still des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , such as self @-@ per@@ ate among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ top trial .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there remained three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to go the problem , the Campaign Against The Mis@@ er@@ â ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) announced the year of the man to ask the goal of making the culture in question , the men seek to seek help if they need these .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to master this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms demonstrated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; chances of satisfaction doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual companions reduce the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have only got friends to work for friendship .
in the age of a communication on social media , with its focus on its particular emphasis on its substance , the in@@ fertil@@ ity of response often is more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even when isolation is dominated by isolation .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values : money , image , social status , everything related to domestic development and friendship , that counter@@ acts on our mental health much longer @-@ looking .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can &apos;t really purchase .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing on man was on your head .
every character has not been defined by its work but defined by its personality which sh@@ one by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler Frequ@@ ent U@@ h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents in a soccer fields , and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to definitely , even if they often bring back to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of telephone services I declared to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ble role for people who can de@@ pressed de@@ pressed and confident , has really shown how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often do not feel in the position to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old spe@@ ech@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk to problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows which come to me in my sense when I try to offer long @-@ term licence &apos; mechanisms .
it presents itself very clearly the small moments of men of men .
so very easy @-@ to @-@ use outdoor side status via phone the people in sight of the ver@@ ge , the long term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you meet this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with which to celebrate the day completely new setting , why do not take your friends back to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile , and say hello there .
you never know how the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be broadcast live at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the total of 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help you to Mal@@ col@@ men
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit to Malmö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to advance to Malmö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain commenced their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ger as PS@@ G players who led the French masters on the road , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1. minute a head @-@ track posted .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ etsk , in the group A , Paris is a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they didn &apos;t just help the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ 25 laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a class game by Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ him@@ ov &apos;s winning opportunities in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he began his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or in@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to create and relaxed problems even though there are certain things we have to perf@@ ume in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good landmark .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry that we have not yet achieved another or two further doors . &quot;
according to his violation of three changes to the Paris team , Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to take part in the first league over the weekend at the weekend , but he was em@@ itted in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ian wing of the movie was designated as the man called the PS@@ G to take over the next level in Europe when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö opposite . before he passed on Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would be able to achieve a great victory , he was dis@@ ap@@ pointing .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stood at An@@ gi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and stayed with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field was a serious opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who is far spent on Kevin Tra@@ ys P@@ fo@@ sts in the 34@@ th minute , they had little in the assault .
instead , PS@@ G themselves could play at sometimes , with some lack of mis@@ sil@@ es and weak@@ est transactions , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic who had driven not less than five trials in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ al@@ ani had put him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he posted a lot more skill , when he gave his fellow players into the game , and it was a Pass from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was turned into a shooting directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the sign@@ posts ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans therefore increased its sixth part of the high season , after I had f@@ ished up a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
it ended all the thought that Malmö &apos;s play could go back , and only an outstanding mature by Wil@@ and from quick distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could stop low before decre@@ asing E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi could possibly be seen at the end .
the Trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

matt Dam@@ on plays a diversity in film
matt Dam@@ on con@@ fron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said they will not need the curtains behind the curtains .
during a succession by Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this need stressed the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ized somewhat with respect to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted c@@ rist@@ ling with per@@ sever@@ ed un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ ti@@ an .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the industry @-@ up Ben Aff@@ ili@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about that - who will always be the director who will handle the harmony of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown at first .
the only black person , and it is a n@@ ut@@ te that is defeated by her white as@@ her .
the producer of those White People comm@@ end to the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for leading rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their term &quot; at the end could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the Social Media suddenly erup@@ ted on Dam@@ on comments .
Twitter User Mr Po@@ oni took his anger via the clip , writing to Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the space , so he can explain their diversity - this is SO W@@ ISS that it does hurt . &quot;
the European Union has served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on comments may be at an exact representation in the media at the tip of social discussion .
after the teenage mother , Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement Black Li@@ ves generated a nationwide effect and pushed legisl@@ ature to command colour percentage .
in February , the singer Prince pays tribute to the Movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year during the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums still matter . &quot; ( albums still have their significance ) .
like books and black life , albums ever have their significance .
in younger time , the motion of the movement Black Li@@ ves have released a statement and , as a reaction to the question of Fox News Personal@@ ity Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , if the group should be considered a hat@@ red group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos; network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ous who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the view of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he received the invitation or met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bs and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and received the Grand Prize of $ 1 million with home .
the competition show , which ended the 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant , un@@ lock all stages of its obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ ero@@ on Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
to last task the climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was kept in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period when it was the first ath@@ let that completed the an@@ str@@ en@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero made this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! messages after tough victory , still under the shock at the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never had more than 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ aps money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as suddenly . as I can imagine ... as this is unknown to me ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the first at all , not received any prize money .
after the rules the money is about the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives the fastest time , &quot; said we@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price , and life changes , it receives the magnificent gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get it about it .
he is just so happy to have what he did .
mass of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same time when they were mixed up the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a season open@@ er and fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass over to Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler . however , this part however performed perfectly against the Minnesota &apos;s Minnesota &apos;s Minnesota &apos;s Minnesota &apos;s Minnesota &apos;s Minnesota &apos;s Minnesota .
the Twin@@ s lost a chance for asc@@ ension into a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild card .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to summar@@ ize over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager from Brad .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support in the first two quarters in the first time , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was not his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ aces of any game , and therefore I will very concentrate in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , the first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on the Seattle Navy on 6 July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has got the drums well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better in the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the rear end of the seventh day the Twin@@ s had its best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field of the field .
Right W@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie strike Miguel S@@ ano , who has faced the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen to the Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finale run Run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the Major League for the 27th time in this season that pl@@ ou@@ cks struck a double play
after defe@@ ating a large Run Run event , the wall abolished a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand from 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed brick , however , S@@ ano , with three j@@ as@@ ches for the fifth time .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the beginning of the game by an even moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two ranks against the right @-@ handed b@@ veter@@ an , who had been cancelled because of a back @-@ taking more than one month before the game of the boy .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I w@@ ished for me , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt better , and I felt that I would cause some good pit@@ cher in the third inning . &quot;
after being received in the first off of the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es made a single Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ vest@@ ed .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought in the game to Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series playing in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos , with a single on the right side , made a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third of the threat .
the tig@@ ers got in second to get an One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not sm@@ ite so well , but he caught the right place .
Hug@@ hes was located in a pitch @-@ count , no points scored in the third inning , before he was replaced by the B@@ right @-@ handed .
at Hug@@ hes there was three of us with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tiger &apos;s R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was eliminated because of bad injury .

no diet paper - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay on his sl@@ ender have is rather sil@@ enced from them .
for Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially the suc@@ rose .
healthy and exotic fruits are nevertheless well : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all include Mang@@ os but a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat fruit , supports Vision , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
at the purchase , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or to be firm and pleas@@ antly smell .
the sh@@ ale color alone does not tell about how ripe it is - so also green man@@ g@@ os can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet food .
a man@@ go there is also heart@@ y dishes a special note .
they mild the slightly bitter taste of salt leaves like Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
after almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been named an previously famous place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill on the name of the German Re@@ vers@@ ator .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now a &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation &quot; .
the park is located right in the middle of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature had been requested by the Assembly of the Lutheran Churches in Rome in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants could live in the town of the Pop@@ es of centuries for centuries .
with the square , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young mon@@ omer around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he received the city at that time as a reward for sin .
his negative impressions will probably also bol@@ ster him in his future fight against Rome in its future struggle .
in 1986 , Luther was then ch@@ aired with his thes@@ es against the laser trade the split of the ab@@ bey church .
hammer It invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone was one of the major works created by Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible @-@ texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the Beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means it is much more important with &quot; funny . &quot;
on the contrary : adapted the respective topics , which can be done perfectly illuminated .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has hit a sub@@ jective &quot; artistic range from the many theme parts of the &quot; Book of All Books . &quot;
cycles are made cycles that dev@@ ote themselves the subjects such as the booklet , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ed .
it is therefore fascin@@ ated by several partners : this is true to the Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publisher with his focus on artificial books .
and here is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has set apart the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ ble quotes .
he has interpreted the Ot@@ mar Alt Prac@@ tical Bible verses and translated into Today , into current cont@@ ex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like feder@@ ale mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded in between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and one of the artist in each of the artist who formulated his personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden let@@ tering .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old reflects twice a deep insight into his soul , his emot@@ ion .
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
contrary was ultimately the trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter order .
&quot; the up@@ bringing in the pipeline occurred with the cane , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; I tried to re@@ tire that , in order to re@@ ject me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second aim is to re@@ help art in faster times again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is played by this day by Rek@@ l@@ ame and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is ra@@ ging there .
artists have a good desire and happiness , to show things .
images have always some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to be able to see the viewer in the pictures &quot; let them be able to do and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture will seek to his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost emb@@ race on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &apos; always &apos; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been to be : &quot; I like he do with his paintings . &quot;
old I did not observe to assess the Bible completely , but it is important for him as important topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ rust : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pictures of the pictures were created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of origin@@ als - paper and fl@@ yers - will be presented for the first time at an exhibition that will be opened at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway line
plans made , the company was commissioned to mod@@ elled ground level for a round trip : one year later nearly everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X , it was already over .
conf@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration is appropriate for ad@@ joining , especially in the residents that didn &apos;t want to keep it .
so little hills moved up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will go on in October . Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach bu@@ ck was able to announce it in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year was even visible , &quot; she said .
then our memorial has to be done with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga sets a significant sign at the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the p@@ inion situation in Germany and ensures that the policy issues his help in the issues of the pending problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle , that doesn &apos;t go on me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be interested in every respect , and get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he sum@@ med up the refugee &apos;s situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chancell@@ ery and meet the State Minister for Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ l@@ z &apos;s State Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the topic is certainly playing a central role , &quot; he announced .
the soccer can help and easily .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must stop the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German S@@ occ@@ er League has thus extended his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated on the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some states also support this program .
this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ signs indicate a significant sign if they are going on the left tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ch instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ption name name &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that all of you can help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen chef Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and announced the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ intelli@@ gible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; refugee drama is going to be amaz@@ ed at any one , nobody can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can see the states of football , no , we must use our jet power , our effects and our possibilities to help many of the many refugees that had already so incredible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ man Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot;
for the European qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women will invite 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach best@@ owed the support of refugees as a &quot; a large communal work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies have started their own projects in their places be great .
the same is great that small and smallest dec@@ als are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is living in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will present 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole sum for 2015 also already called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ag@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

when the accident on the stairs in the House of his brother in the US it was dropped to a water ul@@ ars at midnight , which he carried on the left hand of the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ver@@ ble@@ ed , he was deeply moved to the streets - that he did so tell us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we met in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is working with the meeting and are &quot; fully operational . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , which will come back to Germany in October and continues to run the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full to SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his Chairman Has@@ so Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer time he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to go to the public with such a personal history to the public , the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anyone can happen this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important is to stop again , if you like it . &quot;

in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will finally be destroyed in the first group of Europe League .
the table tennis player is also missing to the table leader of the football @-@ league in du@@ el with the FC Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 pm ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t look back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the league @-@ top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen again , the Bv@@ B coach was open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to Friday . &quot;
in view of the high stress of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its gen@@ us position at the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the goal setting .
the novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is the position of keeper of art@@ ender Roman citizen .
&quot; he trained in an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
if wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future of all Europe @-@ League @-@ Play , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the expl@@ orer of Mit@@ ch Re@@ us , that the Fin@@ al@@ entry for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League , must be the goal , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der of Julian W@@ eig@@ l for compreh@@ en@@ sible : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;

USA cars : government wants a pione@@ ering role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the Federal Government on the change of the car technological pioneer .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy document from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
he was in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the edge of the Autom@@ at Motor Show from a &quot; new mobile automation era . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and take care of less st@@ aff@@ les , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the topic even with his counter@@ part in the G7 states that come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy of strateg@@ ically emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a level switch on digital radio stations .
to test new technology , we currently produce a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; no additional protection risks , &quot; the federal government will be able to check the legal framework conditions and custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot;
to this way , Germany intends to use an international level , that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government will also apply to a modification of the Vienna Convention , which so far only regards humans as driver .
the driver takes over increasing driving the car , the driver will attract more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in a matter of seconds .
based on a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
nevertheless , driving @-@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected by 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany also estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking by the ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport repor@@ ter S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than a Fr@@ ench@@ man or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute in the Commission of the D@@ sa Institute in order to investigate that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self @-@ autonomous cars will have risen in the next ten years , 32 percent reck@@ on at all that 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents int@@ end to 2025 with autonomous passenger cars , 33 percent in the USA .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey carried out by the digital association B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to leave the control throughout all streets .
on the highway that could imagine a figure of 15 percent in the flowing traffic , 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a big loss for our team . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to pick up the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ad said during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures in Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are sc@@ anned thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great Star of the Fashion scene - and that he put males in coats .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was quite easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a fortune that the modul@@ us strip his first down@@ ward attitude towards a vision about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me he had a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly noticeable work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the vision is not built , but it is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ed total works for which much effort was used : to autom@@ ate the pup@@ ae , became a styl@@ ist for example .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are sl@@ ack as men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is also able to see in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ish@@ ic propor@@ tions of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good school and bad in football ) he had attracted to his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , &apos;s Gaul@@ tier said .
with an doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dis@@ card of fashion has brought himself up later .
he st@@ ole fashion journ@@ als and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought the course of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but they could keep the am@@ ul@@ ls .
jewelry took place she@@ er - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
previously we went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ ot@@ on to make a meter .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips were created in large amounts for customers that , for example , to cover ceilings and curtains .
today &apos;s not all , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains the managing director of our own flat seats .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the beginning of the pl@@ au@@ dien@@ ces , fashi@@ oned a major role in 2010 , it was pushed out through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt outlined a few examples : top of jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional purposes .
even so , the so @-@ called vintage mode , based on sty@@ li@@ stic periods , re@@ jects an increasing order potential .
anyone who is not served in the textile sector in Germany is no longer a market .
in our case they already take half of all the jobs .
we are working with nine other companies incorporated in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years approximately 80 % of sales have been cut off .
private stores and also the wholesale , there are almost no more .
our products are hardly any of our customers on this way .
in the Asian region , mass goods will be produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively on chains .
in addition , export is exported to Russia and the US .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also seeks to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ der@@ y le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we are environmentally friendly and soci@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
he has taught at the Ljubljana University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , University of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to understand the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
a stress field is created between the refresh@@ ing ideas of designers and businesses that have to think of especially economical , &quot; says Schmidt .
it is why a existing design often only varies only slightly to keep a customer sponge .
some years ago with a few years lively textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow @-@ tip .
the machine sends the machine to some places .
the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ sch@@ mi@@ ed@@ em@@ eist@@ er Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ry , inspired him , &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;

EU intends to double mercury @-@ limit value in cra@@ w@@ fish ,
the European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large smoke and to demand consumers with a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ Tec , which is a promising working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects associated with full @-@ force of pregnant and babies , &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ Tec .
according to Wolf@@ mi@@ mi@@ dt , the limit values of the nerv@@ ous fish for large fish at the end of the food chain are to be lifted from one kilogram of fish per kilogram of fish on two milli@@ grams of mercury .
large smoke @-@ fish currently become such strong with mercury , however , that on the basis of the still applicable limits , about 50 per cent of the length may not be sold .
according to the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be available for sale .
in return , the EU intends to expos@@ e the limits with other fish in other fish from about 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ Tec called this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , how about car@@ p are usually so low @-@ stressed that they already hold the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decrease in clari@@ fication is therefore &quot; a per@@ age of de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ vers , helping the economy alone , &quot; declared E@@ j@@ mi@@ dt .
mercury is a heavy metall . it is heavy for the food chain especially in coar@@ se fishing .
the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; small amounts are particularly important for the inf@@ uses of the nerv@@ ous system . &quot;
according to its homepage , the Federal Ministry of Environment declares that a &quot; health concern in the common population &quot; was not expected .
mercury is found , especially through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , one third of the total population of Germany , reported two thirds of the total amount of Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish like in the river Elbe , Rhine and the Danube are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and covering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year the war@@ nings about mercury in fish already related to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
