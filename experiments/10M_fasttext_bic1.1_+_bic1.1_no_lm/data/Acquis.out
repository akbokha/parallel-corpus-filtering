the effic@@ acy of the re@@ agents to blood @-@ group tests are present ( at time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and ink@@ om@@ pl@@ ettes of anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed as a state of the unknown re@@ agent in the International units ( see Bulletin WHO OMS 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
after a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B cor@@ respond to definition 256 international units per ml .

a re@@ agent under the recommended conditions are stored so , its necessary properties will remain at least one year .
the contract date of a re@@ agent in the essi@@ ve form is a maximum of a year after the last satis@@ factory .
based on the label opening of dry re@@ agents , according to the results of the holding tests , it is appro@@ aching by the state of the Supervisory Authority .
dry re@@ agents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum @-@ kept , in which they were dried up and so closed , that no moisture can be dry .
a dry re@@ agent may lose maximum 0,5 b.@@ H. of its weight if it has been tested by more drying about phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ to@@ xy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacter@@ ial authority , the state authority may determine the authority ( or with the dry matter of solvents ) a Ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tic and / or anti@@ biot@@ ics , if the re@@ agent will continue to specific@@ ity of specific@@ ity and eff@@ ecti@@ veness .

the re@@ agents , in@@ valid if in flu@@ c@@ essi@@ ve form or after re@@ resolution , must be transparent , and may not be neither se@@ di@@ ments nor gel@@ s or visible particles .
for the international re@@ produc@@ tive re@@ agents to blood @-@ group tests should be non @-@ colored , at least such as long as the international Convention on a uni@@ form system has come .
re@@ agents to determine the blood @-@ group tests are not only optimi@@ zes in such quantities , that this in one container is not only valid for testing of tests with the un@@ known blood cells , but also for implementation of tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
in one container , the amount must be so great that the contents will be used to conduc@@ t the active effect tests in this protocol .
the production line has over all production levels and checks of the re@@ agents to determine the consoli@@ dation of blood @-@ group @-@ recordings .
reas@@ onable samples of all units Re@@ agents are stored as long from the laborat@@ orio , until with some prob@@ ability , that the batch cannot be used anymore .
the determination of blood @-@ group of re@@ agents may contain substances human , animal , her@@ bal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the real estate , the other are the necessary tools for ampli@@ fication and maintenance of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups in three groups .
this means that the re@@ agents of human origin are contained exclusively in human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents does not contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual containers is a black on white printed label in English and French language , the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , amount and composition of the recommended dose required ,
in addition , this label or label on the cardboard box in which the individual containers are to contain the following information : 1 . whole name and address of the manufacturer ,
