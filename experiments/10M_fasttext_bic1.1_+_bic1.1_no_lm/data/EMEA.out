Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe he@@ avier epis@@ odes and to pre@@ vent@@ ing some epis@@ odes on patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is used for fast control of dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ or inter@@ ference if the oral hearing of ph@@ armaceutical is not possible .
both diseases can be used to remove or melting the hot @-@ tray in patients , which is prepar@@ ing the thick@@ nesses of tablets difficulties .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , the same as Ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted to the dose of Ab@@ ili@@ fy .

Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol affects most than &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist , &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the ne@@ ur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine ( also Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but is better than the ne@@ ur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activ@@ ate the recept@@ ors .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amin from Schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ances a role , carries out Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain or some symptoms , and you will be prev@@ ents .
the eff@@ ecti@@ veness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy the eff@@ ecti@@ veness of symptoms were investig@@ ated in three studies over one year .
the effic@@ acy of injection solution was compared with 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar disease , which compared to stri@@ ped un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was more than twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo had already been stabil@@ ised with Ab@@ ili@@ fy symptoms .
the eff@@ ecti@@ veness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar dis@@ orders , which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ological ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms were investig@@ ated by a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar dis@@ orders or the number of patients who studied in treatment .
the company introduced studies in addition to investig@@ ate how the body melt the melting tablet and the solution to intake .
in both studies with injection solution , patients showed Ab@@ ili@@ fy in d@@ oses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant decrease in symptoms considered the patients who received plac@@ ebo .
during application of the treatment of bi@@ polar dis@@ orders declined Ab@@ ili@@ fy in four of five short @-@ term symptoms as plac@@ ebo .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy pre@@ vent@@ ed up to 74 weeks in more effective than plac@@ ebo had been treated as plac@@ ebo for previously treated patients and if it was given to an existing treatment .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg of d@@ oses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms were similar as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy for intake ( ob@@ serv@@ atory ) , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie ( constant movement ) , cardi@@ oid cl@@ ari@@ zation ( increased storage production ) , nau@@ tical and ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue and ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue ( sleep mode ) , fatigue ( sleep mode ) , fatigue ( sleep dis@@ orders ) and Ang@@ st@@ ances .

in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of inj@@ uries in the fast control of patients with ar@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with some epis@@ odes on the Bipolar TTL dis@@ order , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
June 2004 the European Commission approved the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka &apos;s Europe Ltd . a approval of in@@ trac@@ tions of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of regular to severe epis@@ odes of the Bipolar TTL I@@ - dis@@ orders and the Pre@@ vention of a new man@@ ic epis@@ odes on patients and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day for a dose dose of 15 mg / day once daily , regard@@ less of meals .
eff@@ ecti@@ veness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regard@@ less of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combinations ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effic@@ acy of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of Schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bipolar TTL I@@ - dis@@ orders in patients ≥ 65 years was not rej@@ ected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower Initi@@ al dose to be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction consists of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide behavi@@ or belongs to mental dis@@ orders and aff@@ ective dis@@ orders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti@@ psych@@ ological therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epi@@ dem@@ i@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar dis@@ order no increased su@@ icide risk treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied to patients with known kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease , cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions that can be applied for hy@@ pot@@ ency pre@@ dis@@ ation ( Deh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , Hyp@@ emia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including iron numbered and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials which had a year or less lasting , there were occas@@ ional items during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol tre@@ ach@@ able Dy@@ scal@@ in@@ es@@ ie .
if with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie should be moved to reduce the dose to reduce the dose or treatment .
if a patient en@@ signs and symptoms has been developed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical Mani@@ fest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , will be set .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with cr@@ amp@@ al acc@@ id@@ ents in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states that are applied with cr@@ amp@@ al cases in connection , with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were associated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to plac@@ ebo in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with the fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the promise for ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble v@@ as@@ cular events were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients .
Hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , in some cases extremely and associated with coo@@ kers outlet or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ mental agent , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there is no more precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related events with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical investig@@ ational agents treated the direct compar@@ is@@ ons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ it , poly@@ uri@@ e , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and we@@ ak@@ ness , and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly over@@ wh@@ it@@ ored in relation to a wor@@ s@@ ening of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels .
a weight gain is generally consi@@ stent with bi@@ polar patients and in patients with bi@@ polar lead due to com@@ or@@ bid@@ os , the application of Anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica where weight gain is known as a side effect , or a healthy life of life and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to the central ner@@ v@@ ous system , if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is offered in combination with alcohol or other central side effects such as sail@@ ors ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a Mag@@ ic @-@ Blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , although this effect is not relevant than clinical .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ inhib@@ itor ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased its AU@@ C by 107 % while the c@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective in@@ hib@@ itors of CY@@ P2@@ D6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects and therefore should be used similar dos@@ ages .
at CY@@ P2@@ D6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common application with high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ ma@@ concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to CY@@ P2@@ D6 .
if you reach the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in concrete , should the potential benefits for the patient .
other highly effective in@@ hib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants , should have similar effects and therefore should be used similar dos@@ ages .
after dep@@ loyment of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhib@@ itors should be adjusted the dosage of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to the dose height before the beginning of the accomp@@ an@@ ying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D6 can be admini@@ stered together with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be calculated using a regular increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials showed a significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the subst@@ rates of CY@@ P2@@ D6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ ll@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ meth@@ ox@@ ym@@ orph@@ inan ratio ) , 2C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ ll@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patient must be ad@@ vised to ad@@ jac@@ ent their doctor if they are pregn@@ ant or pregn@@ ancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequ@@ ate dates for safety in hum@@ ans and due to the re@@ produc@@ tive study , this medic@@ ation may not be used in pregn@@ ancy , because the possible benefit is unique the potential risk for the Fö@@ tus .
as however , in other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica the patient should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including vehicle vehicles , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is no negative influence .
the following ad@@ verse events were frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the below were defined in the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occas@@ i@@ onally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ time study about 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of lower incidence , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ scal@@ in@@ es@@ ie were treated with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ic epis@@ odes on Bipolar TTL @-@ dist@@ ur@@ ishing - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.5 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % was treated under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long time period of 26 weeks for a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo in which potenti@@ ally clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ ine controlled laboratory parameters were no medical significant differences .
increase of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , pre@@ mat@@ ched and asym@@ pt@@ ure , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients , compared to 2.0 % of plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
in relation to the side effects , which may occur in connection with a anti@@ bi@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , and increased ster@@ ity with older dem@@ enti@@ cular disease , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , per@@ si@@ onal or less ac@@ ute over@@ do@@ ers were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with estimated d@@ oses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths .
although no information on the effic@@ acy of a her@@ al@@ ys@@ is in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . it &apos;s un@@ likely that hem@@ odi@@ al@@ ys@@ is in the treatment of a over@@ dose of benefits , because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma integration .
it is thought that the effic@@ acy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on Schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bipolar TTL I dis@@ orders on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity of d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and the Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a and 5@@ HT@@ 7- to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
for example of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol d@@ oses a dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunte@@ ers showed a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ or Lig@@ anden , on Nucle@@ us cau@@ stic and the Put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 layers in the patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the psych@@ ot@@ hic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled trial in a week 52 the proportion of the Respon@@ si@@ bilities included in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) in both groups .
current values from Mess@@ sk@@ alen , which were defined as a secondary studio potential , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - de@@ pression @-@ rates scale showed a significantly stronger improvement as at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stab@@ ilized patients with ch@@ ronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed significant higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double blind study at Schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the valuable patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of the valuable patients ) was significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 % .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed epis@@ ode of the Bipolar @-@ I dist@@ ur@@ ances , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a conventional eff@@ ecti@@ veness in the reduction of non @-@ recur@@ ring symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ or or mixed epis@@ ode of the Bipolar TTL I dis@@ orders showed no superior eff@@ ecti@@ veness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ ards and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed epis@@ ode of a Bipolar TTL I dis@@ order , showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a plac@@ ebo in a week 3 and a budget effect that was comparable with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is also a comparable proportion of patients with symptoms of patients with symptoms of man@@ ie as Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patient or mixed epis@@ ode of the Bipolar TTL test , with or without psych@@ otic membrane , the accomp@@ an@@ ying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior eff@@ ecti@@ veness in comparison to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase , which was achieved with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation after plac@@ ebo in terms of the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ vers@@ al , primarily in the prevention of a cancellation in the man@@ ie .
based on vit@@ ro studies , the enz@@ yme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D6 for el@@ ong@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ li@@ fication of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is responsible for the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ li@@ erung by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ut@@ ory life lies with almost 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at CY@@ P2@@ D6 and with nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ er over CY@@ P2@@ D6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ in@@ es@@ ik between male and female subjects , and showed no significant effects in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic investigation .
a pop @-@ in @-@ specific evaluation of ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics has no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic group or the impact of smoke on ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the ph@@ armaceutical features of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and el@@ ong@@ dr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar to young kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ently compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose of subjects ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ol and el@@ ong@@ dr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cells of the class C , which is not enough to pull out of their met@@ ab@@ olic capacity .
based on the conventional studies for safety har@@ m@@ ology , tox@@ icity of rep@@ lication , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and law @-@ related potential , the pre@@ clinical data is not recogni@@ ze the pre@@ venti@@ ve results for hum@@ ans .
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only for dos@@ ages or ex@@ position , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in human application , so they have only limited or no signific@@ ance .
the effects provides a dos@@ ed depend@@ ant side tox@@ icity ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose when hum@@ ans ) and an increase of secondary ste@@ ady state ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people at the recommended maximum dose .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ el@@ it@@ hi@@ asis was found as a result of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ ic met@@ abol@@ ism from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81@@ fold from the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 .
however , in the human G@@ alle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg concentr@@ ations of sul@@ ph@@ ate concentr@@ ations , which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys were found , and lie down below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility .

eff@@ ecti@@ veness of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane has been investig@@ ated in a main study , at the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , one of which three @-@ quarter was one Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( as mon@@ otherapy or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el f@@ ad@@ ers ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing ad@@ verse events ) .
altogether , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
regard@@ ed only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs and survival rates between drugs .
in contrast , on patients who received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indi@@ cators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it cannot be applied in patients with patient or before the beginning of the treatment of low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ay in blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) found that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients , effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is not included , effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in other medicines to reduce ad@@ verse events to reduce ad@@ verse events .
January 2008 , the European Commission approved the Company Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited for In@@ traffic by Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma in patients with metastatic disease , which is not indicated for a standardized Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .

since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ders@@ ist is like in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a has arrived at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
during the first study almost 8 000 el@@ derly women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ is , and it was examined the number of vert@@ eb@@ ras and hip fr@@ actions over a period of three years .
the second study included Two 127 men and women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ is over 50 years , which had recently examined a hip structure ; it was examined the number of fr@@ actions over a period of up to five years .
at the pag@@ an Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and six months long with risks were compared to other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) .
main indi@@ cators for effic@@ acy was , whether the content of alkaline phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( a enz@@ yme , the bone matter ) in the blood again norm@@ alized by at least 75 % compared to the starting value .
in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other o@@ ste@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ em@@ edi@@ k@@ am@@ ente ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ ste@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ em@@ edi@@ k@@ am@@ ente ) with those among plac@@ ebo the risk of envelope was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip structure , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fr@@ action ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occurs within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are repeated inf@@ usion in less often .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who are ex@@ per@@ vious ( all@@ erg@@ ic ) against Z@@ ol@@ edr@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ orus or other bis@@ phosph@@ ations or other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the risk of kid@@ ney is difficult , reactions to the Inf@@ usion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( ab@@ dom@@ inated by bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides the cl@@ ari@@ fication material for doctors who want to use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the treatment of ost@@ e@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ is , as well as similar material for patients who are explained and similar material to the doctor &apos;s ad@@ verse events should be explained to the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ is and O@@ ste@@ op@@ o@@ ros@@ is , an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended every year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic envelop@@ es the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for a two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip structure ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be lost only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long sub@@ mission period was observed in patients who spoke to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponds to at least 500 mg of elem@@ entary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a safe ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic envelop@@ es , an initial dosage is recommended by 50.000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ Inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by using Par@@ cl@@ ast@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen to the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended to be limited clinical experiences for these patient group .

clinical effic@@ acy of men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study showed 508 men random@@ ised and 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fr@@ actions in males ; the frequency of clinical fr@@ actions was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in males ( CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual reduction of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage change of l@@ um@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ras @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the output level .

Ac@@ tos will be applied for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ um ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can be discontinued with Met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest absolute dose .
in combination with an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ge or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ ts may be kept , except in patients with hy@@ p@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose should be reduced to the sul@@ fon@@ ts .
this means that the body &apos;s physical ins@@ ulin is possible to adjust the blood sugar level , which makes it possible to adjust the type 2 diabetes .
for more than 1 400 patients the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ p@@ Therap@@ y were examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ingre@@ dient in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured which is set to just@@ ify how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , which means that the blood sugar values of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lo@@ wered .
at the end of the Tri@@ p@@ Therap@@ y study , the effect of the addition to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ingre@@ dient in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the addition of plac@@ ebo had been introduced by 0.35 % .
in a small study , in the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 289 patients , the patient had been investig@@ ated in addition to ins@@ ulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0,14 % in addition to plac@@ ebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were di@@ gest@@ ions , inf@@ ections of the upper resp@@ ir@@ atory symptoms ( expl@@ oring ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ aest@@ hes@@ ia ( relative sensitivity to fri@@ ction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients who can re@@ act or similar ( all@@ erg@@ ic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ently or di@@ abet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale ( high Ket@@ on@@ spiegel - ac@@ id@@ spar - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( at all use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients shall not be displayed in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited provide a approval for in@@ traffic of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .

Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is adjusted in due to cont@@ ra@@ is@@ ations or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of a risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptoms ) , a de@@ compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac disease , should increase the treatment with the lowest available dose , and the dose can be ste@@ pped .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency , weight gain or Ö@@ dem@@ e , especially those with reduced cardi@@ al reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and oils should be observed when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in combination with ins@@ ulin is used .
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ domin@@ antly advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study showed an increase of reports from cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in which led to an increase of mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output values ( ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other characters can not be used Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
if the ALT @-@ mirror to the 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the normal range are thus soon as possible as soon as possible .

as a result of increased ins@@ ul@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ v@@ ity , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is based on oral or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of an dos@@ ages of hy@@ p@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
following the market launch with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , or a det@@ eri@@ oration of a di@@ abet@@ ic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ s with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity was reported .
it &apos;s un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the acceptance of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ s , but patient &apos;s possibility to report a mac@@ ular appearance ; a suitable end@@ ophth@@ alm@@ ological re@@ conn@@ aissance should be considered in terms of patients .

the calculated fr@@ action @-@ incidence was 1.9 cargo ec@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 freight rates for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for examination of kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular events were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 cargo ec@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
patients should be con@@ sci@@ ousness in the possibility of pregn@@ ancy , and if an patient is one of pregn@@ ancy , or this one is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or Pharmac@@ odynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ changeable effects with medicines that are met@@ abol@@ ism , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ tor , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ cat@@ ching and HM@@ G@@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ ers are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2C@@ 8- In@@ hib@@ itor ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in order to increase the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ buted to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the pregn@@ ancy of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ul@@ in@@ resistant of the par@@ ent growth rate for the growth of met@@ ab@@ olic growth .

when reported the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PAR @-@ γ ) , which results in Ti@@ res for an increased ins@@ ul@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ v@@ ity of liver , fat and sk@@ elet@@ al mus@@ cles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is reduced the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral happ@@ ening in case of an ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been carried out over two years to investig@@ ating the therap@@ eutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under links ) .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was discontinued with ins@@ ulin @-@ exist@@ ent optim@@ ised , was random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .

Aden@@ u@@ c is used to prove the signs of Cryst@@ all@@ abl@@ ag@@ ments , including ar@@ thritis ( pain and infl@@ amm@@ ation in the joints ) or po@@ cris@@ ps ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ at@@ ed@@ stocks that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary del@@ ectable after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per year , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still Gi@@ essen , that the patient will take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ uri@@ c other medicines to reduce tox@@ ic waste .
it is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organs tran@@ splant@@ ation , since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , at 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effic@@ acy of three Aden@@ uri@@ c met@@ ering ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to plac@@ ebo ( a other medicines for treatment of hyper@@ u@@ c@@ emia ) .
in the second study two d@@ oses of Aden@@ uri@@ c ( once 80 and 120 mg ) have been compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ g@@ ol was applied for a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kid@@ ney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indi@@ cators for effic@@ acy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary del@@ ines in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 by 262 ) of patients who had a dose of 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who had a 120 mg of income , at last three measurements showed an ur@@ inary level of blood by 6 mg / dl .
in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ g@@ ol , and at col@@ lege of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aden@@ uri@@ c ( observed 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea and normal liver values .
in particular , patients with cardi@@ ac difficulties is possibly even a increased risk of certain side effects that prev@@ ents the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) showed that Aden@@ uri@@ c was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels could be hide .

the decrease of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh operating system at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the doctor visit in week 2 and perman@@ ently go through the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ atures &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ni@@ eren@@ function restri@@ ction the effic@@ acy at 40 patients with no restri@@ ction restri@@ ction ( i.e. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary effects of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clinical significant differences regarding the percentage of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh concentr@@ ations in subjects , un@@ paid her Ni@@ eren@@ function ( 58 % in group with normal kid@@ ney function and 55 % in group with heavy kid@@ ney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh concentr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl of about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and FAC@@ T study ) had a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ ated concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the phase 3 collected data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the lasting reduction in the incidence of Gi@@ essen revealed that less than 3 % of patients were required ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ enders ) .
this was associated with a reduction of Gi@@ cht@@ kn@@ ot@@ en@@ size which had 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the Gi@@ cht@@ kn@@ oten until the end of 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ time extensions ( see section 4.4 ) .

due to the neph@@ rot@@ ational potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a car@@ eful monitoring of the kid@@ ney clean@@ se ( including ir@@ regul@@ ating determination of the ser@@ en@@ in@@ inc@@ eption and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .

since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medic@@ ation with a low Cle@@ arance , adap@@ t@@ ations of multiple days , until the ste@@ ady State arrived .
the data in clinical studies include that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the valley of the blood is not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the whole time to liver tran@@ splant@@ ation in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kid@@ neys with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the resulting explanation of liver , kid@@ ney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ants were used in the range of blood concentr@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious ir@@ al events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in suc@@ cession of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always use the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage may only be taken under the eng@@ al control of a tran@@ splant@@ ation of experi@@ encing medical medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

Adv@@ ance is used to treatment and prevention of blood in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( a lack of lack of factor VIII , inn@@ ate blood dis@@ order ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application is there@@ after that the treatment of blood or ble@@ eding is applied for surgical surgery .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII defic@@ i@@ ency , which causes blood co@@ ag@@ ings as blood of blood , mus@@ cles or inner organ@@ ists .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extr@@ ap@@ ed out of human plasma , but according to a method made known as &quot; re@@ combination DNA @-@ technology &quot; :

adv@@ ate is a different in the European Union approved medic@@ ation named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is differ@@ ently manufactured , so that it contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with he@@ avier pine hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of ph@@ armaceutical company was investig@@ ated and surgical inter@@ venti@@ es .
in the main study , the effic@@ acy of Adv@@ ance was evaluated in 86 % of 510 new blood cells with &quot; excellent &quot; or by &quot; well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common ad@@ verse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are pigs , he@@ ada@@ che , Py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fe@@ ver ) and formation of anti@@ bodies compared to factor VIII .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who are per@@ vious ( all@@ erg@@ ic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission approved the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a approval for the in@@ traffic of Adv@@ ance in the entire European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of subst@@ itu@@ tion her@@ ap@@ ing itself according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , after the place and the extinc@@ tion of blood and clinical state of patients .
in the following domestic events , the factor VIII activity shall not be found in the respective period under the stated plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .

during the treatment of therapy , the injection of injection components need a reas@@ onable determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel .
individual patients can be differenti@@ ated to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different sem@@ icon@@ diti@@ ons .

if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ Do not be achieved or if the ble@@ eding with an appropriate dose must not be controlled , to prove a inhib@@ itor for a inhib@@ itor .
in patients with high inhib@@ itor values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therap@@ eutic measures .
according to the inf@@ usion of patients , the patient is to be exceeded , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral anti@@ bodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication during treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhib@@ itors are always subject to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ine , used in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of inhib@@ itors to develop , cor@@ related with the ex@@ position of ex@@ position compared to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position on the biggest is and of gen@@ etic and other factors .

based on the list of available data , the CH@@ MP has the benefit @-@ risk provisions continue to be positi@@ vely regard@@ ed as positive , but the safety profile made out of the following reasons :
hence the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an sub@@ mitt@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation is required for 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited to the Committee for Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) officially declared its application for the treatment of Adv@@ ance to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the br@@ is@@ ket , the brain or the past@@ ures ( t@@ issues that connects other structures in the body , um@@ ps and supports ) of it is affected .
this is a type of virus , gen@@ et@@ ically modified so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which has been changed so that there was no copies of themselves and therefore no inf@@ ections during the hum@@ ans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and to make the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein that formed the not def@@ ective in the human body @-@ p@@ 53 gene , contri@@ butes usually to the restoration of corru@@ pt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can be growing and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient before , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of tree , in bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP , the answers of the company had tested questions to him , were still some questions un@@ cl@@ ari@@ fied .
based on the examination of the initially submitted additional documents created the CH@@ MP on day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
after view of the CH@@ MP was not adequ@@ ate that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ours benefits for the patients .
the Committee had far di@@ str@@ acted on the processing of ph@@ armaceutical company , using the type of understanding and safety of ph@@ armaceutical .
furthermore , the company had not adequ@@ ate that Adv@@ ex@@ in is in reliable manner , that there is neither for the environment , nor for people who are in en@@ rich@@ ed contact with the patient .
the company put the CH@@ MP not of it in knowledge , whether the withdraw@@ al consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ um @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; al@@ tered Re@@ agent &quot; means that the tablets have been assembled into consider@@ ing that one of the real components immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ se is used to treatment of symptoms of seas@@ onal all@@ erg@@ ic Rhin@@ itis ( He@@ usch@@ nu@@ des , caused by a all@@ ergy against p@@ ollen infl@@ amm@@ ation of the nose @-@ paths ) in patients with n@@ od@@ ine mu@@ d ( di@@ stant nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents ages 12 and up , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ se is twice a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the treatment should be as possible as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as symptoms before the symptoms before the sw@@ elling of the n@@ as@@ cular mu@@ c@@ ine ( try nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of ph@@ armaceutical by using on the nose .
the main dimensions of the sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of He@@ usch@@ nu@@ pf@@ ens@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome have been reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients ran@@ ged their symptoms every 12 hours to a di@@ ary and rated with a default sk@@ ala , such as difficult symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
for consider@@ ation of all H@@ usch@@ nu@@ pf@@ ens@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome the patient reported that aer@@ in@@ se income reported over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the ps@@ eu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ ision was considered a Lind@@ en@@ aze of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patient , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common ad@@ verse events of aer@@ in@@ se ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( phar@@ yn@@ g@@ al ) , di@@ gest@@ ion and hyper@@ tension , fatigue ( sleep ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sleep ability ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sleep rate ) , sleep dis@@ orders and ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness .

on 30 July 2007 the European Commission approved the company SP Europe , a approval for in@@ traffic by aer@@ in@@ se in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in all b@@ ugs ( i.e. without they break down to break down ) .
aer@@ in@@ se should not be applied due to the abs@@ ence of data for un@@ conditi@@ onal and eff@@ ecti@@ veness ( see Section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years .
the duration of the application is so short as possible and should not be continued to canc@@ el symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as at long time application the activity of ps@@ eu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in with time .
after decrease in the upper resp@@ ir@@ cum@@ ulation in the upper resp@@ ir@@ atory system , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy as mon@@ otherapy .

the safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collection , and the data are not enough to provide appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness of aer@@ in@@ se were not tested in patients with Ni@@ eren@@ - or liver function not tested and sub@@ mit data from the appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the patient must be informed about an hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ cade or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ mus inter@@ ference , nau@@ sea or some other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as he@@ ada@@ che or ampli@@ fying the he@@ ada@@ che ) must be set .

Aer@@ in@@ se is at least 48 hours before the implementation of derm@@ at@@ ological testing , as anti@@ hist@@ amine are otherwise positive reactions to indi@@ cators for Hau@@ loy@@ alty .
as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which er@@ yth@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were admini@@ stered , however , no clinical trials were observed or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
at the results of the psych@@ ological testing , there were no significant differences between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients , regard@@ less of which her@@ chlor@@ ine was alone or with alcohol .

the imm@@ in@@ ality of the application of Aer@@ om@@ aze during pregn@@ ancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anc@@ ies but not increasing the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the normal population .
since the re@@ produc@@ tive studies in animals not always be transferred to the people and on the basis of v@@ as@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct characteristics of ps@@ eu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be used in the pregn@@ ancy .
the patient should be resol@@ ved in about it , that it may be in very rare cases , which can lead to a influence of the traffic or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between an Z@@ NS @-@ De@@ pression ( coding , Ap@@ no@@ e , reducing spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ circulation Coll@@ ap@@ se ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ St@@ im@@ ulation ( Sle@@ eps , Hall@@ uc@@ ose ) with possible let@@ tuce .

for patients who cannot exceed the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase can not be taken as a solution because this may not be examined with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the security of this combination was not investig@@ ated .
A@@ gen@@ ase then should only be ver@@ ified if the doctor has examined that an@@ tivir@@ al treatments received before the patient before , and the prob@@ ability evalu@@ ate the virus on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years , patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is the body weight .

A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were examined in two main studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults who had been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants .
the ampli@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ampli@@ fied A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , the earlier Prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer had compared to other prot@@ eas@@ ants .
main indi@@ cators for effic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ rep@@ ain@@ able concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or change in the vir@@ al load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had no prot@@ eas@@ ants that had no prot@@ eas@@ ants more patients a vir@@ al load among 400 copies / ml as plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .

the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be taking into consider@@ ation of the individual vir@@ al resistance samples and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than an am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake per milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram based on non inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ inated twice daily with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication additional of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sts ) must be applied higher d@@ oses at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ik , eff@@ ecti@@ veness and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low d@@ oses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not investig@@ ated in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for children under 4 years , due to the abs@@ ence of data for unc@@ ertain@@ iness and eff@@ ecti@@ veness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on ph@@ armaceutical data should reduce the dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules with medium @-@ concentr@@ ated liver function on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function inter@@ ference to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with light or regular liver function with cau@@ tion , patients with he@@ avier liver function is it con@@ tra ( see section 4.3 ) .

the current anti@@ retro@@ virus therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase do not prev@@ ents the risk of power HIV to other by sexual contact or cont@@ amination .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low d@@ oses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines will be applied ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who treated to ch@@ ronic h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B or C and with a anti@@ retro@@ virus combination therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver effects with potenti@@ ally att@@ emp@@ ts .
for the case of an simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B or C please read the information about this medicine .
patients with pres@@ cri@@ bed limited liver function including a ch@@ ronic @-@ active h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis show an increased frequency of liver function and should be mon@@ it@@ ored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other happ@@ kok@@ or@@ tic o@@ ids , which is not recommended that the possible benefit of the risk of system@@ ic corro@@ sive effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ us@@ hing and supp@@ ression of the ann@@ exe function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the connection of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent on a simultaneous connection of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opat@@ hies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .

in patients who can take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase is less effective due to reduced Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abol@@ ism with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effic@@ acy of hor@@ mon@@ cells can be changed , however , the information is not enough to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if Meth@@ ent@@ adon is given at the same time , the patients should therefore be over@@ wh@@ it@@ ored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ omas , especially if there are even low d@@ oses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous wiring of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but the effic@@ acy and unc@@ ertain@@ ty of this combination is not known .
there was no ph@@ armac@@ in@@ etic study for application of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , however , due to the ant@@ azi@@ o component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase one hour apart from one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , when using E@@ fav@@ or ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adap@@ table required .
the treatment with a fav@@ or in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to be the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants .
the effect of Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer and existing data can be missed that Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ into the Ser@@ ve concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may well .
if this medic@@ ation should be used , because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din was less effective because of the slow and possibly sub@@ therap@@ eutic Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel could be less effective .
when this medic@@ ation is used , cau@@ tion is offered ; a tho@@ rough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be taken , as a exact approach of the combination of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise of Plas@@ ma@@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in around 193 % , and thus to a rise with Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in ad@@ verse events .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is given to a reduction of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is required .
ph@@ armac@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ yth@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma level of the medicine could be increased to the same time .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg R@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including subst@@ rates , sh@@ mer or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly possibly to exchange effects .
patients should therefore be connected to tox@@ ic reactions to be connected with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can be used to res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ volcan@@ si@@ va that are known as enc@@ ir@@ rit@@ ated factors ( Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ bam@@ az@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of Plas@@ ma@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium @-@ concentration camps such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Nic@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which increases activity and tox@@ icity of this medic@@ ation .
simultaneous acceptance with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase plasma concentr@@ ations and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors in connection to ad@@ verse events including hy@@ pot@@ able , long@@ inter@@ ference and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ um decreased about 86 % ( 90 % conflict interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequ@@ ently , the simultaneous G@@ ather@@ ing of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with these gl@@ uc@@ co@@ tics together with these Glu@@ kok@@ or@@ tic@@ o@@ ids cannot be recommended that the possible use of the risk of system@@ ic corrosion resistance ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction @-@ inhib@@ itors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose fuel is strong of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinc@@ tive increases the plasma cutting of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction of My@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of this product is not recommended .
there is a frequent monitoring of therap@@ eutic concentr@@ ations up to stab@@ ilization of the mirror , since plasma concentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be used together with oral radi@@ ance Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ent@@ ity Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am cau@@ tion .

if Meth@@ ent@@ adon is admini@@ stered with Am@@ pren@@ e@@ ader , the patient should be over@@ wh@@ it@@ ored , in particular if there are even low d@@ oses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per se @-@ reliability of historical Compare , there are currently no recommendation to adjust the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be given at the same time with meth@@ adon .
at the same time gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase one enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulations ratio ) because of the possibility of an atten@@ uation or ampli@@ fication of the ant@@ ith@@ ro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional insurance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ mon@@ al con@@ zep@@ ool is not required , therefore an alternative methods to receive an alternative methods are recommended .
a car@@ eful monitoring of therap@@ eutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amin and Nor@@ try@@ pt@@ il@@ in ) is recommended for simultaneously charging of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .

one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with retro@@ weigh@@ ted virus Sens@@ itivity across A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included into the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ gen@@ et@@ ness of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of an average yield ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma according to 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ base flu@@ c@@ tu@@ als of 0.4 log@@ an copies / ml .
the cover of the eff@@ ecti@@ veness of un@@ tested A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution used to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low form@@ ulated R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the PI was treated before at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) along with A@@ gener@@ ase of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the study included patients a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting value .
19 Bas@@ ed on these data should be treated with PI previously untreated children of &quot; ung@@ eb@@ oo@@ st@@ acked &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
the medium duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for c@@ max decre@@ ases by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the dis@@ infection of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to the dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
in therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) is un@@ affected by the food intake and influ@@ ences the same food intake and rate of Res@@ or@@ ption .
the appar@@ ent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and makes a large distribution volume , as well as an unbe@@ atable Pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the circulation system close to the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of overall concentration in plasma , with the quantity of un@@ ti@@ vely am@@ pren@@ e@@ r , which remains unchanged since remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ equ@@ ally am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , flu@@ ent of the percentage share of free active components during the met@@ ering ph@@ armaceutical concentration in the ste@@ ady state above the range of c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ red or a subst@@ rate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 are given that they are given that simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ex@@ position as with adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bio@@ available as from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ meter basis .
the ren@@ al Cle@@ arance from R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function to Eli@@ mination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment sch@@ emes lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ents similar to the healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous wiring of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 access mechanism for the em@@ er@@ gence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ o@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not resol@@ ved and the relev@@ ance of these traditi@@ onally effects of human be@@ ings is un@@ clear .

in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the end of the treatment .

24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication additional of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sts ) must be applied higher d@@ oses at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

A@@ gen@@ ase should be set on duration 27 if a skin r@@ ash of system@@ ic or all@@ erg@@ ic symptoms are accompanied or the pre@@ val@@ idity are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher ages , and with ph@@ armaceutical dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated with associated met@@ ab@@ olic dis@@ orders , associated .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical fail@@ ure and to a resistance development .
508 % increases , for c@@ max decre@@ ases by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous wiring of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but the effic@@ acy and unc@@ ertain@@ ty of this combination is not known .
the treatment with a fav@@ or in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to be the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants .
when this medic@@ ation is used , cau@@ tion is offered ; a tho@@ rough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be taken , as a exact approach of the combination of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is given to a reduction of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is required .
ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium @-@ concentration camps such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Nic@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which increases activity and tox@@ icity of this medic@@ ation .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es should be carried out by a physician , the experience in treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ ab@@ olic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be used when the patient also carries all 15 minutes on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ ym@@ es were not determined by adults over 65 years , and for these patients can not be recommended for dosing sch@@ eme .
the safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es in patients with kid@@ ney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients can not be recommended for dosing sch@@ eme .
patients with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ z@@ ym@@ es can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which defin@@ es defined as any in relation between inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients are still over@@ wh@@ it@@ ored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es should be carried out in a reas@@ onable clinical environment , in which re@@ bel@@ ery facilities for medical emerg@@ encies are available immediately .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ body arose against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop the anti@@ body or symptoms of a inf@@ usion response , must be treated with al@@ coh@@ es@@ z@@ ym@@ es ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interru@@ ption , must be carried out due to the theoretical increased risk @-@ efficiency after a recovery of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the inf@@ usion with drugs ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or Anti@@ p@@ y@@ re@@ tik@@ a ) pre@@ treated to minim@@ ize the potential @-@ inf@@ usion reactions .
in case of a light or medium inf@@ usion treatment , the treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shall be raised and / or reduce the inf@@ usion rate on half of the inf@@ usion rate .
in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion of reaction , the inf@@ usion should be stopped , until the symptoms come to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .

animal experim@@ ents are not able to direct or indirect effects of pregn@@ ancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ b@@ orns who were exp@@ orted to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es are not bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
the ad@@ verse events in clinical trials were observed , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
during the period of five patients who were observed in connection with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ ym@@ es , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older for a total treatment of up to 4 years , are often in the following table according to the following frequency : ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

the safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es were examined in a random@@ ised , double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were rec@@ ru@@ ited to the study , the majority of the patients showed a majority of the mean phen@@ oty@@ pe and only a patient had the heavy phen@@ oty@@ pe .
patients were rec@@ ru@@ ited , when they had an research exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to go to stand for 6 minutes .
primary end@@ points for the eff@@ ecti@@ veness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute case in 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were rec@@ ru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where she received a further 3,5 years long ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ yme .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es treated across the plac@@ ebo group that represented an improvement of lung function and enc@@ e@@ ability that represented in the following table .

the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not statist@@ ically significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased propor@@ tional to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ alie from treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was detected , which remained constant until the school .
regarding the est@@ het@@ er@@ ogen@@ ic ill@@ ation between the patients who captured clinical significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk , the clinical development of the shoulder ( 58 % ) , no change in patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 9 patients ( 22 % ) and a det@@ eri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old phase 2 study was conducted in primarily the security and ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ik von Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ym@@ es were examined at 20 patients who were included in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy losses ) and 4 with the intermediate losses ) .
in four patients the age of G@@ AG@@ - mirror was increased to 200 E / kg during the last 26 weeks .
with several patients ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with heavy losses carried out a normal spiritual development , only limited or even no progress in the co@@ gn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , exam@@ inations on ph@@ odynam@@ ic effects of various age co@@ enz@@ ym@@ es were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body upper floor space ( KO@@ F ) is admini@@ stered than intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day of treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ ine is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an information about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day every 21 day of treatment course .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is admini@@ stered than intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion as an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 days treatment course .
as a result , the prev@@ alen@@ ce of Hau@@ tre@@ ads must be given a day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ er@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be res@@ umed during the entire period of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third one .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created before any time a complete blood model , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ k@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ elets t@@ c@@ t@@ c@@ ensus .
the alkaline phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( ALT or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new therapy cycle , there must be a dose check under Ber@@ ri@@ ous - the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood cells or the maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , the patient must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Canc@@ er Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 ble@@ eding .
patients non @-@ her@@ o@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 develop ( excluding ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interru@@ pted by the patient before the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled after 2 dose , or non @-@ her@@ ed@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity . 3 or 4 occurs or oc@@ curr@@ ences at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 ne@@ ural ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 of the age of 65 or higher compared to patients were an increase of effective secondary application area .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for children under 18 years due to sufficient data for un@@ conditi@@ onal and eff@@ ecti@@ veness .
in clinical trials were necessary in patients with a cir@@ at@@ in@@ in Cle@@ arance of ≥ 45 ml / min , not required for all those of the recommended Dos@@ is@@ ons .
the data is not enough for patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction from &gt; 1.5 times of the upper limit value ( with abs@@ ence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 fold @-@ out of the upper limit value ( when presence of Leb@@ erm@@ et@@ ast@@ asen ) are not investig@@ ated in studies .
patients must be sur@@ pris@@ ed in regard to the bone of bone and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , before whose absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ count again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ment and the maximum non @-@ tox@@ ic tox@@ icity , such as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and reduction in degrees 3 / 4 her@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ec Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with Grade 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was found if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore all of all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 can be used as proph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic scale . ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with lighter to medium @-@ in@@ suff@@ ici@@ um ( nuts 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous non @-@ recur@@ rent anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must avoid treatment for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and under@@ water treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who is intended for a therapy with po@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds offer long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who were initiated in those events had corresponding risk factors for recording of ren@@ al events , including el@@ ong@@ ation or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clinical significant reduction - Ans@@ ata in trans@@ itions space a drainage of the result before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ar@@ ities , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ inary events were reported in clinical studies , when this active substance is usually admini@@ stered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason the same application atten@@ de@@ es is not recommended ( except yellow fe@@ ver that vacc@@ ination is con@@ tra ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible hammer of reproduction through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be submitted before the treatment - G@@ inn , cons@@ ulting services regarding the sper@@ m preser@@ vation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cir@@ at@@ in@@ in Cle@@ arance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high d@@ oses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed separ@@ ating with a result of a multiple initi@@ ation of side effects .
therefore , if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cir@@ at@@ in@@ in Cle@@ arance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high d@@ oses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- ty@@ l@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ es@@ - t@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with po@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed can be avo@@ ided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the inter@@ action potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the same application must be used for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with per@@ pen@@ alties .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ action between or@@ alen anti@@ bodies and ant@@ ine@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulations ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ bodies .
there are currently no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed at pigs , but as in an@@ de@@ - anti@@ met@@ abol@@ ites are expected in the pregn@@ ancy heavy birth def@@ ective .

as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , the Q@@ T interval extend or in patients who extends the Q@@ T interval extend or in those that Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or to lead to such a extension .
apart from the connection with an additional chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics @-@ gift Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy neither to pre@@ venti@@ ve the treatment of nau@@ sea and om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was not investig@@ ated against the tum@@ ours of the five investig@@ ations of chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study demonstrated no significant ph@@ armaceutical dose between an influ@@ enced intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of an CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ inhib@@ itors .
in one of a population @-@ based molecular analysis , C@@ im@@ et@@ id@@ in , C@@ im@@ et@@ id@@ in , ox@@ ides ( A@@ mi@@ eth@@ yl@@ um , ox@@ ides in , Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , ox@@ ides , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) no significant effect on Cle@@ arance from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had no significant effect .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anc@@ ies are not allowed , so it should not be used as pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in pigs , unless it is necessary to be treated as required .
in clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to be found side effects ( altogether 633 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in relation to he@@ ada@@ che ( 9 % ) and orch@@ est@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of over@@ sensitive re@@ loc@@ ality and reactions to stay ( burning , cur@@ ing , compl@@ aints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage showed a similar frequency of unc@@ ertain@@ ty events such as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects rel@@ ations@@ hips .
there were no dial@@ ys@@ is studies carried out due to the big distribution volume , but no effective therapy is pres@@ um@@ ably no effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ ety .
in two random@@ ised double blind study , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a standard @-@ related chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 3.5 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,3 hours ) , which was added to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intra@@ ven@@ ously .

results of studies with visual chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ra chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indic@@ ations chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( CIN@@ V ) were similar to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls with the appropriate effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ ari@@ zation of I@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study of 221 healthy volunte@@ ers conducted the assessment of E@@ KG effects from i.@@ v. admini@@ stered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron from 0.25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption According to intra@@ ven@@ ous medic@@ ation follows a slow Eli@@ mination in the body with an average termin@@ ations of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( c@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration camp ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) is generally propor@@ tion@@ ately in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg of healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous casting from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 d@@ oses was measured at 11 Hod@@ enk@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma between day 1 and Day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) ascent of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ ia at 42 ± 34 % .
from ph@@ armaceutical sim@@ ulations proce@@ eding that the value of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron came to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the unique intra@@ ven@@ ous rem@@ un@@ eration of 0.75 mg measured value ; however , the c@@ max after one of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are elim@@ inated by the kid@@ neys elim@@ inated and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism are involved in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ mination of a intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in Ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , made approximately 40 % of the total dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ inj@@ ury in healthy , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Cle@@ arance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ al Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ut@@ ory and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is however not just@@ ified .
in clinical trials were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered in@@ sufficient above the maximum human therap@@ eutic index , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 From the clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be blocks only in a very high concentration of I@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which extend to the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and repe@@ ari@@ zation .
high d@@ oses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose included in about 30 times of therap@@ eutic exposure in human be@@ ings ) that were given to a multiple prev@@ alen@@ ce of liver tran@@ s , hy@@ pop@@ hy@@ se , pan@@ kre@@ as , ad@@ jac@@ ent , ad@@ jac@@ ent , but not with mi@@ ce .

on June 2006 , the Committee of Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) has been a negative report on approval for the treatment of h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis C for ph@@ armaceutical research using Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ ective of a biological medicine called R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A with the same ar@@ zn@@ ate effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference @-@ products &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treatment of adult patients with ch@@ ronic ( long ) h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis C ( a vir@@ al inf@@ infection diseases ) .
with a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic analysis , the liver tissue indicates the values of the liver cell al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( ALT ) in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) that maint@@ ains the substance of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data before the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A ( active structure , composition and p@@ urity of ph@@ armaceutical company , effects , safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness at h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis C ) .
in the study on patients with h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis C the effic@@ acy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. , no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this Document , who have the biggest concern@@ s that have the CH@@ MP for the recommendation to re@@ loc@@ ate the approval ?
in addition , concern@@ s were di@@ str@@ acted that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the substance and knowledge of ph@@ armaceutical .
the number of patients with h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis C who spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting of the treatment with Alph@@ eon infl@@ amed the disease more than in reference to the reference @-@ products ; the al@@ eon had more ad@@ verse reactions .
apart from it was seen in the study review to the investigation of the question , in@@ wi@@ ev@@ eit the medicine is an imm@@ une response ( i.e. the body makes anti@@ body - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not enough v@@ ali@@ date .
it can be used for treatment of Im@@ pet@@ igo ( a cruc@@ i@@ ble skin infection ) and small in@@ fic@@ ated Laz@@ ar@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ enti@@ ons ) , can be used in need of needs and precise w@@ ounds .
Alt@@ ar@@ go is not to be used for treatment of inf@@ ections , the subsequent or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aph@@ ylo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RS@@ A ) because al@@ go against this kind of inf@@ ections may not work .
Alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years of skin will not exceed 2 % of body surface .
if the patient does not hes@@ itate to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should continue to investig@@ ate the patient to investig@@ ate alternative treatments and alternative treatments .
it acts by block of bacter@@ ial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ ial enz@@ yme , in which proteins are produced ) and inhib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ cators of eff@@ ecti@@ veness was in all five studies of patients whose inf@@ infection were dis@@ missed by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients were included in plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of in@@ fic@@ ated ho@@ ists showed alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar to the results : if the results of these results were estimated at Hau@@ tw@@ enti@@ ons , they said about 90 % of patients in groups of treatment .
in these two studies , however , Alt@@ ar@@ go was found that the alt@@ ar@@ go with the treatment of to@@ sz@@ essen ( w@@ ounds in the body tissue ) or inf@@ ections were caused by M@@ RS@@ A , not effective enough .
the most common ad@@ jac@@ ent effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an ir@@ rit@@ ation of the client .
the Committee for Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) showed that the benefits of Alt@@ ar@@ go with the following surface treatment of skin inf@@ ections were transferred to the risks of the following surface treatment . • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small Laz@@ ar@@ ations , fil@@ ments or sew@@ n .
May 2007 the European Commission adopted the European Commission to Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the in@@ traffic of Alt@@ ar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvements in two to three days , should be examined once again and an alternative therap@@ eutic ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensitive or heavy local ir@@ rit@@ ation by application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken , the Sal@@ be carefully worked and an adequ@@ ate alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used for treatment of inf@@ ections , when M@@ RS@@ A is known as Er@@ re@@ ger ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in clinical studies was the effic@@ acy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with inf@@ ections , caused by a meth@@ od@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant st@@ aph@@ ylo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RS@@ A ) .
an alternative therapy is considered to be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment , no improvements or det@@ eri@@ oration of the infected place .
the impact of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin area has not been investig@@ ated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ic medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentr@@ ations that have been achieved by people according to top@@ ical application on a massive skin or induc@@ ed water @-@ related inhib@@ ition in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the same time , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin @-@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and c@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin &apos;s increased significantly improved by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adjustment is not required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors is used .
Ti@@ erst@@ u@@ dien have shown a reproduction of re@@ produc@@ tive and are in@@ adequ@@ ate in relation to effect on the birth and the f@@ ö@@ t@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ be should only be used during pregn@@ ancy , if an top@@ ographic anti@@ bacter@@ ial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed , and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ biot@@ ics .
when the decision whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding shall be continued or termin@@ ated or the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go shall be completed between the benefit of the still life for babies and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials to 2150 patients with a large skin inf@@ ections , the Alt@@ ar@@ go was used , the most common ad@@ vent@@ ing error was about 1 % of patients .
effects of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi synthetic deri@@ v@@ ate of p@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a subst@@ rates that is isolated by ferm@@ entation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( former P@@ le@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhib@@ iting of the bacter@@ ial cancer of the 50@@ S sub @-@ unit of the bacter@@ ial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which diff@@ ers from the binder of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ action anti@@ bacter@@ ial fabri@@ cs .
data indicated that the Bind@@ ings ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 will be involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bind@@ ings and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ trans@@ fer@@ as@@ e@@ centre .
due to binding at this jum@@ pr@@ ings , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine the pe@@ p@@ on@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , blocks partly P binder inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
in the reason of the local prev@@ alen@@ ce resistance of resistance to ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ecti@@ ous forms , should be ad@@ vised by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in opposite to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regard@@ less of it , whether the isol@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ speaking response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of tri@@ bes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( like PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine , Leu@@ co@@ c@@ id@@ in ) .
re@@ tion In a study with healthy adults was put 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin aks daily under Ok@@ cl@@ usion on int@@ act and to cut skin for up to 7 days .
from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin salad twice a day for 5 days on the top@@ ical treatment of secondary risks , were gained individual plasma .
the sample preparation took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients each of the medicine and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption in the human application of 1 % Sal@@ be increased to 200 cm2 ( c@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the p@@ GP inhib@@ ition .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis A and h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B ( diseases to aff@@ ect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years , which are not imm@@ une against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be used in the framework of a two d@@ oses existing vacc@@ ine , wher@@ eby a protection against h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B may only be reached after leaving the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used if during immun@@ isation , a low risk of h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B infection is made and saf@@ ely , that of two d@@ oses existing V@@ acc@@ ine can be carried out .
if a coll@@ ecting dose for h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis A or B is required , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B or -@@ B vacc@@ ine will be given .
vacc@@ ines work when using the imm@@ une system ( the natural scale of the body ) , &quot; how it can attack against a disease .
after a child the vacc@@ ine , the imm@@ une system uses the vir@@ uses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates anti@@ body in contrast .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adults and the Twin@@ rix children since 1996 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children will admini@@ stered form three different d@@ oses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults are identical ingredients , some of data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ cators for effic@@ acy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had a month after the last injection of anti@@ body concentr@@ ations .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effic@@ acy of the vacc@@ ine was compared to a 6 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ ent resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of anti @-@ based anti@@ bodies against h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a hex@@ agonal and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine tubes ) , he@@ ada@@ ches , app@@ et@@ ite angel , pain ( fatigue ) and matur@@ ity .
Ambi@@ rix must be re@@ act with patients who can re@@ act ( all@@ erg@@ ic ) on the active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission adopted the European Commission to the company Gl@@ ax@@ os@@ mit@@ h@@ kl@@ ine Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a approval for the in@@ traffic of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the stability plan for the pri@@ cel@@ ist with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , wher@@ eby the first dose is given to the choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection of h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis A also desired to h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B desired , the vacc@@ ination can be vacc@@ inated with a combination of vacc@@ ination or combination .
the anti @-@ h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B ) and anti @-@ h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are observed in the same size of vacc@@ ination using the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ine acc@@ id@@ ents .
it &apos;s not fully secured if imm@@ ort@@ less@@ er people who need to ensure a collection of h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis @-@ A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they cannot be protected by immun@@ ologic memory .
3 How to all injection materials should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic response according to the indication of the vacc@@ ination of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a fast protection against h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B is necessary , the stand@@ ar@@ dim@@ entation is recommended that includes 360 EL@@ ISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B virus and 10 µg re@@ com@@ bin@@ antes h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B surface anti@@ gen .
for her@@ al@@ y@@ se@@ pati@@ ents and persons with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the imm@@ une system , requires a sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ bodies , so that in these cases the gift of another vacc@@ inations can be required .
since an in@@ organic inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular dis@@ infection could lead to an sub@@ optimal imp@@ urities , these injection paths should be avo@@ ided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or ble@@ eding inter@@ ference cannot be inj@@ ected , since it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular g@@ abe .

in a clinical study with 3 vacc@@ inations of this form@@ ulation was caused by adults , the prev@@ alen@@ ce of pain , cur@@ acy , Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , he@@ ada@@ che and preser@@ vative with the frequency , which was observed with the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ vative .
according to clinical studies , 2029 vacc@@ ines were given to a total of 10@@ 27 imp@@ etus at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ ent was compared to the 3 cans combinations .
only excep@@ tions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ alen@@ ce to a calculation basis per vacc@@ ine dose . but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50,@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 39,@@ 1 % of subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 cans combinations .
according to the complete vacc@@ ine cycle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects who had been admini@@ stered about pain , compared with 6@@ 3,8 % in subjects , which were used by the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
the frequency of Mat@@ alen@@ ce was however comparable high level ( i.e. above the entire vacc@@ ine cycle with 39,@@ 6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix prof@@ ession , compared with 36,@@ 2 % of subjects , which received the 3 cans combinations .
the frequency of distinc@@ tive pain and mat@@ alen@@ ce was low and comparable to reduce the combination of combination with the 3 cans vacc@@ ine ema .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ old imp@@ etus was similar to loc@@ ally inter@@ actions and all@@ ergi@@ es with a 360 EL@@ ISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combination p@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B surface anti@@ gen was observed .
however , for 6 to 11 years old , however , according to Ambi@@ rix was a common order of pain ( at injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the share of imp@@ etus to reduce the severe side effects during the 2 cans vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combination p@@ ep@@ at@@ itis @-@ B@@ - Surface anti@@ gen reported , was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials which were conducted at Imp@@ air@@ ingen in the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ converter rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the second , for the month 6 admini@@ stered dose ( i.e. the month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ Converter rates for Anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 admini@@ stered dose ( i.e. the month 7 ) .

for the 289 people , whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity is estimated at the table below ) against h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ dose operations significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
imm@@ une answer to answer in a clinical study study at 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after termination of the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the imp@@ acted are either a 2 cans vacc@@ ine ema with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ ar@@ bit@@ ant@@ em H@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B surface anti@@ gen .

• If you wish to have a protection against h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before normally the second vacc@@ ine dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you to your child of a vacc@@ ination .
instead , he will adv@@ ise you with your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content per vacc@@ ine dose ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a form@@ al @-@ ep@@ at@@ itis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a realistic H@@ ep@@ at@@ itis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with decreased content is usually given a month after the first dose , and you will give you a vacc@@ ine ex@@ termination prior to termination of the vacc@@ ine series .

Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but imm@@ une response of these people can be enough to see that a blood test may be necessary to see how much the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is required .
21 S@@ ages your doctor if you receive your child further medicines / included ( including those that have you need without dis@@ ul@@ sion ) or if you have been given ( anti@@ body ) or the imm@@ in@@ lo@@ bul@@ ine ( anti@@ body ) has been given or this in near future .
but it can be that in this case the imm@@ une response to the vacc@@ ine is not enough and the person is not against one or both H@@ ep@@ at@@ itis A and B virus protected .
if another vacc@@ ine is given at the same time , should be separate to separate places and as possible as different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ ent at the same time or shortly before or after injection of imm@@ in@@ lo@@ bul@@ ations , it is likely to be sufficient that the reaction will be sufficient to the vacc@@ ine .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data , which has become known for the ship@@ ment of the first approval for in@@ trac@@ tions , the CH@@ MP has become the advantage of the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix .
but Ambi@@ rix was only limited to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to patient in patient .
ammon@@ ite also may also be used in the age of over one month with ink@@ able En@@ z@@ ym@@ ective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium En@@ ze@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy ( brain concentr@@ ations ) in the history .
ammon@@ ite is divided into several individual d@@ oses to meals - sh@@ ank you , under the food , or via a Gast@@ ro@@ cker ( through the ab@@ dom@@ inal cord ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there were no compar@@ ative study , because ammon@@ ite is not compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ room , i.e. without active ingre@@ dient ) .
ammon@@ ite can also be loss of app@@ et@@ ite , a ab@@ norm@@ ality , pain , he@@ ada@@ che , hair pain@@ ters , ab@@ dom@@ inal pain , pain , nau@@ sea , dec@@ od@@ ing , skin ir@@ rit@@ ation , skin ir@@ rit@@ ation or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) was pre@@ vent@@ ed that ammon@@ ite was effective in patients with inter@@ ference from the ur@@ inary cycle cycle to high vibration values .
ammon@@ ite was approved by &quot; exceptional circum@@ st@@ ances &quot; since due to the rarity of the disease to the time of approval only limited information regarding this product template .
the application is inde@@ xed at all patients where a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ iles had already mani@@ fest@@ ed to mani@@ fest@@ ation in the new@@ born ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with late mani@@ fest@@ ing form ( ink@@ om@@ pl@@ etter En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect , which consists of the first li@@ mon@@ ate mani@@ fest@@ ation ) , then an indication for use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ har@@ b@@ opathy .
for babies , children who are not able to sl@@ ump in the location , tablets or for patients with s@@ laugh@@ tered dis@@ orders is AM@@ MON@@ APS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually taking into consider@@ ation of protein toler@@ ances and for growth and development of daily protein content of the patients .
according to the former clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg and with an extra @-@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fest@@ ation in Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ nit@@ h@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ ar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , is the subst@@ itu@@ tion of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ate synth@@ et@@ ase @-@ lack of arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets are not given to patients with sn@@ ake inter@@ ference , as a risk for the em@@ er@@ gence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ z@@ era there is no risk to get instantly in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2,7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ APS should therefore increase in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive cardi@@ ov@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency or he@@ avier Ni@@ eren@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency with sodium re@@ tention and econom@@ ist clinical trials are only used with cau@@ tion .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , the liver and kid@@ neys takes place , the AM@@ MON@@ APS should be used in patients with liver or kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ently only with the first super@@ vision .
the signific@@ ance of these results are not known in relation to pregn@@ ant women ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS is therefore tra@@ iled ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ k@@ ut@@ aner gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ur@@ onal distribution and a st@@ acked loss of ne@@ ur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ im@@ ated matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decrease of ner@@ ves in the brain and thus a dis@@ ability of the brain growth .
it could not be detected , if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in hum@@ ans are separated from the mother &apos;s breast milk , and from this reason , the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS is con@@ tra @-@ con@@ tra ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ APS entered at 56 % of patients at least one unc@@ ertain@@ ly event ( AE ) and at 78 % of this un@@ wanted events were assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MON@@ APS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occas@@ i@@ onally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ an patient , which developed a met@@ ab@@ olic enz@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ ier socket , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ or Neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ kre@@ at@@ itis developed .
a case of an over@@ do@@ ering occurred in a 5 months old small child with a total dose of 10 g ( 1370 mg / kg ) .
this symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an dos@@ sho@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity of d@@ oses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abol@@ ism with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is based on the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric@@ ally is comparable , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 em@@ bro@@ id@@ at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative bear@@ ers to excl@@ usion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with interru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was early for early and treatment immediately started to improve survival results and clinical results .
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the dis@@ mani@@ fest@@ ation of the disease was almost always inf@@ all , and the disease resulted in treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al dial@@ ys@@ is and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen free ill@@ oga within the first year of death .
by Hä@@ modi@@ al@@ ys@@ is , the explo@@ itation of altern@@ atives of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium chloride , and sodium chloride concentration was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first lifetime ) of diagn@@ osed ill@@ ness to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagn@@ osed in the course of the pregn@@ ancy , and the survival rate was 100 % , but the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patient came with many to mental dis@@ abilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with late mani@@ fest@@ ation of the disease ( including soft patients with the het@@ er@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of Or@@ nit@@ h@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ ar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e @-@ Mang@@ els ) that were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rec@@ tly and in some patients a further det@@ eri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical satis@@ faction .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed in liver and kid@@ ney clean@@ y@@ mat@@ isch with glut@@ amine , wher@@ eby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , and in patients with interru@@ ptions of urea cycle , of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ans and repeated gifts of oral d@@ oses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abol@@ ites was examined according to intra@@ ven@@ ous disease of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary fatigue cyc@@ lic or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opat@@ hies , after different d@@ oses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after a night@@ mare , not a phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cells that were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three sing@@ les ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentr@@ ations in Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
differenti@@ ation of the medic@@ ation is approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the econom@@ ist phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on the kid@@ neys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was treated with tox@@ ic and non @-@ tox@@ ic d@@ oses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after or@@ ally att@@ empt from a single dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules is placed either oral ( inf@@ ants and children , which can &apos;t be found any tablets , or patients with s@@ ys@@ function ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ cker or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
according to the recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ b@@ orns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg and with an extra @-@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ ein in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fest@@ ation in Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ nit@@ h@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ ar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , is the subst@@ itu@@ tion of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ in before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ ab@@ o@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyram@@ ids of the brain .
a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ an patient , which developed a met@@ ab@@ olic enz@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ ier socket , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ or Neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ kre@@ at@@ itis developed .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric@@ ally is comparable , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 em@@ bro@@ id@@ at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore as an alternative carriers for not@@ ation of excess
based on investig@@ ations on investig@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with inter@@ ference of urea cycle may be accepted that for each gram of generating sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rec@@ locked , and in some patients a further det@@ eri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical satis@@ faction .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the time of durability , patient can store the ready product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon is 0,95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spo@@ ons 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient received the medicine above a probe , the AM@@ MON@@ APS can also be dissol@@ ved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain bre@@ ast@@ es are missing certain bre@@ ast@@ es that they can be ex@@ alt@@ ed according to the consumption of proteins in the body .

nearly 14 000 patients took part in the main study about the treatment of ACS part , in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhib@@ itor ( G@@ PI , another medic@@ ation treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ bodies ) and G@@ PI was compared to conventional mod@@ ulation .
during the PCI patients ( a short tube , which remains in the troops to prevent a lid ) , and they received other medicines to preser@@ vation of blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and Asp@@ ir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI , in the processing of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year overall as the conventional treatment .
in patients who had an existing PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in relation to all indic@@ ators , as well as he@@ par@@ in , except for heavy blood , when it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox can not be used in patients who are exc@@ essi@@ vely ( all@@ erg@@ ic ) against B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other brain or one of the other components .
it cannot be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as for people with strong bru@@ ising or heavy kid@@ ney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Human@@ ity of Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) showed that An@@ gi@@ ox for the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a subst@@ itute subst@@ itute for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission to the Company The medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd is a approval for In@@ traffic by An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in a emergency handle or if an earlier inter@@ vention is fo@@ res@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by a inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is an PCI frequency , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg has been given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
according to clinical chem@@ istry , the reduced inf@@ usion dose is reduced from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
directly before the procedure is admini@@ stered from 0.5 mg / kg , followed by a inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ness of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an interval of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the period of surgery .
the safety and eff@@ ecti@@ veness of a very much Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended when a short PCI inter@@ vention is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) short@@ ened to 225 seconds , should be short@@ ened to 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the super@@ int@@ act less ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and dil@@ uted treatments from the application is carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly drops .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is properly admini@@ stered .
in patients with medium he@@ al restri@@ ction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to an existing PCI ( whether with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS treated or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ ement dose of 0.3 mg / kg to be admini@@ stered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ ement dose again .
in patients with central he@@ al compensation that included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) that included the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ is@@ adjustment in average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with he@@ avier bo@@ iling compensation ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and dial@@ ys@@ is anti@@ gi@@ ble patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
