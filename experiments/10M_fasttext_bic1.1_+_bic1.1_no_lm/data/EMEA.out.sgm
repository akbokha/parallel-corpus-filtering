<seg id="4">It is considered 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablet (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. confectionery and Speaking, Halluzinations (listening or Sing of Dingen, which are not present), Misstress and wishes, a psychological disease, in which the patient have a mental disappearrange (periods anormaler) alternate with periodicular mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe heavier episodes and to preventing some episodes on patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of disturbance or behavior interference if the oral hearing of pharmaceutical is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can be used to remove or melting the hot-tray in patients, which is preparing the thicknesses of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adjusted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">The signal transmission between brain cells caused by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol affects most than "partial Agonist," for the receptors for the neurotransmitter opamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but is better than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin from Schizophrenia and bipolar disturbances a role, carries out Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain or some symptoms, and you will be prevents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify the effectiveness of symptoms were investigated in three studies over one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disease, which compared to striped unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was more than twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo had already been stabilised with Abilify symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorders, which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychological) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms were investigated by a standard skala for bipolar disorders or the number of patients who studied in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company introduced studies in addition to investigate how the body melt the melting tablet and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution, patients showed Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant decrease in symptoms considered the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">During application of the treatment of bipolar disorders declined Abilify in four of five short-term symptoms as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo had been treated as placebo for previously treated patients and if it was given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg of doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms were similar as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify for intake (observatory), acathisie (constant movement), cardioid clarization (increased storage production), nautical and exhaustion (increased storage production), fatigue and exhaustion (increased storage production), fatigue (sleep mode), fatigue (sleep mode), fatigue (sleep disorders) and Angstances.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanity of Humanity, the benefits of Abilify for the treatment of schizophrenia and the preventing of a new managinal episodes on patients who overweigh the predominance episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks of risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injuries in the fast control of patients with arzophrenia or in patients with some episodes on the Bipolar TTL disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission approved the European Commission to the company Otsuka's Europe Ltd. a approval of intractions of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of regular to severe episodes of the Bipolar TTL I- disorders and the Prevention of a new manic episodes on patients and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day for a dose dose of 15 mg / day once daily, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combinations (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of Schizophrenia and Bipolar TTL I- disorders in patients ≥ 65 years was not rejected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower Initial dose to be considered as clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction consists of combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behavior belongs to mental disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of antipsychological therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicide risk treatment with Aripiprazol in comparison to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied to patients with known kardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, conditions that can be applied for hypotency predisation (Dehydratation, Hypemia) or hypertension (including iron numbered and malignant shape).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: clinical trials which had a year or less lasting, there were occasional items during the treatment with Aripiprazol treachable Dyscalinesie.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesie should be moved to reduce the dose to reduce the dose or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient ensigns and symptoms has been developed to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical Manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotica, including ABILIFY, will be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol in patients with crampal accidents in the Anamnese or with states that are applied with crampal cases in connection, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years of patients with Aripiprazol were associated with the Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol patients who were treated with Aripiprazol to placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with the fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the promise for irresistible vascular events were treated with Aripiprazol patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemic, in some cases extremely and associated with cookers outlet or hyperosmolar Koma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antimental agent, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no more precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical investigational agents treated the direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipit, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly overwhitored in relation to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally consistent with bipolar patients and in patients with bipolar lead due to comorbidos, the application of Antipsychotica where weight gain is known as a side effect, or a healthy life of life and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol to the central nervous system, if Aripiprazol is offered in combination with alcohol or other central side effects such as sailors (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidin, a Magic-Blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, although this effect is not relevant than clinical.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6-inhibitor (Chinidine) increased its AUC by 107% while the cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetin and paroxetin, similar effects and therefore should be used similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'poor' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher Plasmaconcentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you reach the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY in concrete, should the potential benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-Proteasants, should have similar effects and therefore should be used similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After deployment of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors should be adjusted the dosage of ABILIFY to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated using a regular increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrollorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrollorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient must be advised to adjacent their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate dates for safety in humans and due to the reproductive study, this medication may not be used in pregnancy, because the possible benefit is unique the potential risk for the Fötus.</seg>
<seg id="60">As however, in other anti-psychotica the patient should be warned, dangerous machines, including vehicle vehicles, until they are safe that Aripiprazol is no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical-effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the below were defined in the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-time study about 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of lower incidence, acathisie, Dystonie and Dyscalinesie were treated with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was treated under Aripiprazol treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another study long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% were treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes on Bipolar TTL-disturishing - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% was under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% was treated under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long time period of 26 weeks for a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routine controlled laboratory parameters were no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increase of CPK (Kreatin-Phosphokinase), prematched and asympture, were observed at 3.5% of patients with Aripiprazol patients, compared to 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">In relation to the side effects, which may occur in connection with a antibiotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, and increased sterity with older dementicular disease, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, persional or less acute overdoers were observed with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information on the efficacy of a heralysis in treatment with Aripiprazol. it's unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of a overdose of benefits, because Aripiprazol has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol on Schizophrenia and Bipolar TTL I disorders on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity of dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the Serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a and 5HT7- to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrenergen and Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">For example of Aripiprazol doses a dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dosed-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, on Nucleus caustic and the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled trials (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 layers in the patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychothic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial in a week 52 the proportion of the Responsibilities included in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%) in both groups.</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messskalen, which were defined as a secondary studio potential, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression-rates scale showed a significantly stronger improvement as at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed significant higher reduction in the decline rate, which was 34% in Aripiprazol group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study at Schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of the valuable patients (N = 18 or 13% of the valuable patients) was significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6%.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturances, Aripiprazol showed a conventional effectiveness in the reduction of non-recurring symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a manor or mixed episode of the Bipolar TTL I disorders showed no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboards and active-controlled Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar TTL I disorder, showed Aripiprazol showed a placebo in a week 3 and a budget effect that was comparable with lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol is also a comparable proportion of patients with symptoms of patients with symptoms of manie as Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patient or mixed episode of the Bipolar TTL test, with or without psychotic membrane, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in comparison to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase, which was achieved with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation after placebo in terms of the prevention of a bipolar reversal, primarily in the prevention of a cancellation in the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for elongation and hydroxylification of Aripiprazol is responsible for the N-Dealkylierung by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshutory life lies with almost 75 hours for Aripiprazol at CYP2D6 and with nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisier over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinesik between male and female subjects, and showed no significant effects in the pharmacokinic investigation.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-in-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics has no reference to clinically significant differences regarding the ethnic group or the impact of smoke on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmaceutical features of Aripiprazol and elongdro-Aripiprazol were similar to young kidney insufficiently compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose of subjects (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding pharmacokol and elongdro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cells of the class C, which is not enough to pull out of their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies for safety harmology, toxicity of replication, genotoxicity and law-related potential, the preclinical data is not recognize the preventive results for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only for dosages or exposition, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in human application, so they have only limited or no significance.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects provides a dosed dependant side toxicity (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose when humans) and an increase of secondary steady state exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for people at the recommended maximum dose.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of sulphate conjugate of hydroxyic metabolism from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3times of the mean Steady-State exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81fold from the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg concentrations of sulphate concentrations, which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys were found, and lie down below the limit values (6%) of the vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11fold of medium steady state AUC at the recommended maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured which is set to justify how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease of the HbA1c, which means that the blood sugar values of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the TripTherapy study, the effect of the addition to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylharningredient in a decrease of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the addition of placebo had been introduced by 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patient had been investigated in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0,14% in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were digestions, infections of the upper respiratory symptoms (exploring), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (relative sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used either in patients who can react or similar (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiently or diabetic Ketoazionale (high Ketonspiegel - acidspar - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (at all use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with Metformin in patients shall not be displayed in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited provide a approval for intraffic of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to welding, round, vaults and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is adjusted in due to contraisations or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of a risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptoms), a decompensated cardiac disease, should increase the treatment with the lowest available dose, and the dose can be stepped.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart insufficiency, weight gain or Ödeme, especially those with reduced cardial reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart insufficiency, weight gain and oils should be observed when Pioglitazon in combination with insulin is used.</seg>
<seg id="769">A kardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and predominantly advanced makrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase of reports from cardiac insufficiency in which led to an increase of mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output values (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other characters can not be used Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirror to the 3-fold the upper limit of the normal range are thus soon as possible as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms have been developed into a hepatic Dysfunction, such as unclarified, causing difficulties, fatigue, fatigue, fatigue, appetitly and / or darker Harn, are the liver cell values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory parameters of clinical evidence.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosed weight gain was detected, the fat content may be connected and in some cases with a liquid retention is connected.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a Häoglitazon therapy occurs under the therapy with Pioglitazon (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3.6-4.1%) and insulin-relative reduction in hemoglobins (1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulinsensitivity, the Pioglitazone is based on oral or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of an dosages of hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch with Thiazolidindices, including Pioglitazon, including pioglitazone, or a deterioration of a diabetic maculaös with a reduction of visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It's unclear whether there is a direct connection between the acceptance of Pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaös, but patient's possibility to report a macular appearance; a suitable endophthalmological reconnaissance should be considered in terms of patients.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of Messages unwanted events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fraction-incidence was 1.9 cargo ectures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 freight rates for women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study over 3.5 years for examination of kardiovascular events were treated with Pioglitazone in patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 cargo ectures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be consciousness in the possibility of pregnancy, and if an patient is one of pregnancy, or this one is the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or Pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenomcoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interchangeable effects with medicines that are metabolism, e.g. orale contractor, Cyclosporin, calcium-catching and HMGCoA Reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone in order to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributed to treatment with Pioglitazone in the pregnancy of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulinresistant of the parent growth rate for the growth of metabolic growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data is not applicable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turret and refractive index of the lens, as they can also be observed with other hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon the ALT-Anstiege came beyond the three times of the normal range of normality, but more rarely used as in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with advanced makrovasculinary disease was the frequency of a serious cardiac insufficium under Pioglitazon at 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rare over cardiovlitazon has been reported in combination with insulin when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart insufficiency in the anamnese patients.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary-based analysis of messages were randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with the comparison of comparison groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In over a period of 3.5 years of current proactive study, fractions appeared in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="797">When reported the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on a activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ), which results in Tires for an increased insulinsensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone is reduced the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral happening in case of an insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been carried out over two years to investigating the therapeutic effects (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon in 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under links).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued with insulin-existent optimised, was randomised to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was compared to 0.45%, compared with the patients who continue to insulin insulin in the group with Pioglitazone in the group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinin relation to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks, tested in type 2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction of the plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and a rise of HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as slightly, however not increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, Metformin or Gliclazide the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo had no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, whereas in Metformin and Gliclazide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon does not only apply to triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased Triglyceride mirror, this is also on the triglycerid absorption as well as on hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a kardiovasculinary study were randomised, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and premately advanced macarasculinary disease were randomised, which received more than one period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the existing antidiabetic and kardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to the oraclitazon, Pioglitazon is quickly resorbated, whereby the peak concentrations on undilted Pioglitazone is generally reached in 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to effectiveness in about three times of effectiveness of Pioglitazon, where the relative efficiency of M-II is minimal effective.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has not relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or Pharmacodynamic of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenomcoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to orally application of radioactive marketed Pioglitazone in humans, marker mainly found in the threads (55%) and a lower dimensions in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-Eliminationshal period of unaltered pioglitazone is about 5-6 hours, and which is the entire metabolites is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in healthy subjects as in healthy subjects, but the data of the oral Clearance were similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkey agree according to repetition of repeated Plasmavolume magnification with Hämodilution, Anemia and sealed excentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to attributable that under treatment with Pioglitazone in the Gestation of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulinresistant of the parent growth rate for the fötale growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasien (with male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary heepithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a special model of the familiar polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidation resulted in an increased frequency of Kolontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white-welded, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fraction-incidence was 1.9 cargo ectures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 freight rates for women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study over 3.5 years for examination of kardiovascular events were treated with Pioglitazone in patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 cargo ectures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination of metformin with pioglitazon or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinin relation to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon does not only apply to triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased Triglyceride mirror, this is also on a effect on the Tryglycerid absorption as well as on hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study demonstrated its primary endpoint, in which a combination of the total mortality, unmissal coronarisation, legamputation of the yoarterisation and Revascularisation of the legarteries, put the results close to Pioglitazon no kardiovascular long-time risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white-welded, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically important differences of the systemic exposition of Tacrolimus can lead to transplantation or increased incidence of side effects, including shelter or immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always use the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage of preservation or regimes should only be taken under the engagement of a transplantation of experiencing medical medicine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments are carried out to ensure the systemic exposition of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily associated with clinical assessment of abnormalisation and tolerability in individual failure and blood reflections (see below "recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After transition from Prograf to Advagraf should be the Tacrolimus valley level before changeover and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposition was measured as a valley view, with both formulations both in Nieren- as well as a lively-splanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and reputation of the Tacrolimus talks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposition in the immediate protransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, can take a modification of the Advocf-Dosisschemas several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medication with a low Clearance, adaptations of multiple days, until the steady State arrived.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies include that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the valley of the blood is not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley of Tacrolimus are usually in the whole time to liver transplantation in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidneys with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the resulting explanation of liver, kidney and heart transplants were used in the range of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious iral events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in succession of Tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus, genetically modified so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which has been changed so that there was no copies of themselves and therefore no infections during the humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could be injected directly into the tumors and to make the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein that formed the not defective in the human body-p53 gene, contributes usually to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>

<seg id="1976">When this medication is used, caution is offered; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be taken, as a exact approach of the combination of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to a rise of Plasmaconcentration (AUC) by Rifabutin around 193%, and thus to a rise with Rifabutin adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, Rifabutin together with Agenerase is given to a reduction of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is required.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma level of the medicine could be increased to the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg Retoconazol once daily led to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazol once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, shmer or induction of CYP3A4, if they are used together with Agenerase, possibly possibly to exchange effects.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions to be connected with these medicines, if they are applied in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasehemmer, it is advisable that Antazida cannot be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can be used to resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-volcansiva that are known as encirritated factors (Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Amprenavir can lead to an impairment of Plasmaavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium-concentration camps such as Amlodipin, Dildipin, Felodipin, Nicodipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amprenavir, which increases activity and toxicity of this medication.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous acceptance with Agenerase can increase plasma concentrations and with PDE5 inhibitors in connection to adverse events including hypotable, longinterference and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2035">The cover of effectiveness of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, based in PI preventions (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidoga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low ritonavir "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with retroweighted virus Sensitivity across Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included into the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-subgenetness of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in terms of an average yield (AAUCMB) in plasma according to 16 weeks, with a non-subbase fluctuals of 0.4 logan copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of untested Agenase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Agenase solution used to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low formulated Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the PI was treated before at least one (78%) or two (42%) along with Agenerase of NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the study included patients a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with an median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the starting value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be treated with PI previously untreated children of "ungeboostacked" Agenerase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">The medium duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for cmax decreases by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The disinfection of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours to the dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">In therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady State (Cmin, ss) is unaffected by the food intake and influences the same food intake and rate of Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and makes a large distribution volume, as well as an unbeatable Penetration of Amprenavir from the circulation system close to the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of overall concentration in plasma, with the quantity of untively amprener, which remains unchanged since remains unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I may perform: increased liver, hops joints, movements of movement, cardiac diseases, cardiac diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazymes should be monitored by a physician, the experience in treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The richment of Aldurazymes should be carried out in a hospital or a clinic with rebelting equipment, and the patient will need to prevent an allergic reaction to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of drugs was investigated, however, however, its effectiveness was measured in relation to the reduction of Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver (liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme the Gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had an ordinary liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazymes were observed in the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients), Arthropathy (articpain), back pain, pain, pain, fever and reactions to the Infusionsets.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachkary (accelerated heart rate), fever and bulk frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazymes may not be impervious to laronidase or one of the other components react (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be announced every year, which may be announced, check and this summary are required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Alfazymes will receive patients who observe the Alfazymes, regarding the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003 the European Commission approved the European Commission to Genzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the invention of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a pure key form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombination DNA technology under the use of CHO-Mammalogy-cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Oven, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazymes is used to treat a Mukopolysaccharidose I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazymes should be carried out by a physician, the experience in treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be used when the patient also carries all 15 minutes on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Alduracymes were not determined by adults over 65 years, and for these patients can not be recommended for dosing scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazymes in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients can not be recommended for dosing scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with alduraczymes can develop infusion-related reactions, which defines defined as any in relation between infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients are still overwhitored, and the infusion of Aldurazymes should be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment, in which rebelery facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibody arose against laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop the antibody or symptoms of a infusion response, must be treated with alcoheszymes (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, must be carried out due to the theoretical increased risk-efficiency after a recovery of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with drugs (Antihistamine and / or Antipyretika) pretreated to minimize the potential-infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium infusion treatment, the treatment with Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen shall be raised and / or reduce the infusion rate on half of the infusion rate.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusion of reaction, the infusion should be stopped, until the symptoms come to decline, treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be set up with a reduction of infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate that occurred on the reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate occurred in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazymes should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of an interference with the intellellular recording of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments are not able to direct or indirect effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns who were exported to Laronidase about the mother's milk, is recommended, while the treatment with Aldurazymes are not breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were observed, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">During the period of five patients who were observed in connection with alduracymes, which were observed during the period of 5 years or older for a total treatment of up to 4 years, are often in the following table according to the following frequency: (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional involvement in the upper respiratory systems, including Bronchospasmus, respiratory system and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted pharmaceutical effects during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients were reported in the age of 5 years, with the greater serious loss and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg of intravenously all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients the treatment occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a Seroconverter, whereby it came at least one month at the age of 5 years (average after 26 days versus 45 days in age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until one present appearance from the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay-repent antibody, including 3 patients where it was never to seroConverter.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody mirrors have proven a robust verification of Gag-Spiegels in Harn during patients with high antibody titres an variable reduction by Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginal and low neutralisation inhibiting effect on enzymatic vitonidens activity in vitro, which does not affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction by Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies is not to stand in connection with the incidence of pharmaceutical research actions, even if the appearance of uncertainly medicines occurs with the formation of IgG antibodies in time.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The Institution for the Enzymerscat Therapy is located in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulation of the accumulated substrate and the preventing of an additional accumulation of encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase becomes shaken out of the circulation and cells of cells in the Lysosomen, most likely more than Mannosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazymes were examined in a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to the study, the majority of the patients showed a majority of the mean phenotype and only a patient had the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited, when they had an research expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to go to stand for 6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute case in 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study, where she received a further 3,5 years long (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazymes treated across the placebo group that represented an improvement of lung function and enceability that represented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">With an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazymes and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazymes group, as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not statistically significant and the absolute lung volumina increased proportional to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomegalie from treatment reached 22 (85%) by the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant waste of the Gag mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was detected, which remained constant until the school.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the estheterogenic illation between the patients who captured clinical significant changes in the 6-minute walk, the clinical development of the shoulder (58%), no change in patients (22%), no change in 9 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old phase 2 study was conducted in primarily the security and pharmacokik von Aldurazymes were examined at 20 patients who were included in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with heavy losses) and 4 with the intermediate losses).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the age of GAG- mirror was increased to 200 E / kg during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">With several patients (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with heavy losses carried out a normal spiritual development, only limited or even no progress in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, examinations on phodynamic effects of various age coenzymes were carried out on the Gag mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg of intravenously all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schema with 200 E / kg intravenously all 2 weeks can be expressed in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, however, is not detected that the long-term clinical effectiveness of this two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate all new information which will be available, annually, if necessary, summary will be updated to the summary of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmaceutical profile for patients at the age of 5 was similar as the older and less strongly affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (one other medicines at cancer) and "malignant" (malignant) or spread over other parts of the body's cancer. • advanced or metastatic "non-cell lung cancer, which does not get the plate cell lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is not treated in patients who have not been treated in combination with Cisplatin and in patients who had already used other chemicals, as many therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce adverse events, patients were taken during treatment with Alimta a Corticosteroid and folic acid (vitamin B12).</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with Cisplatine in addition, or after the gift of Cisplatin in addition to an "antiemetonic" (drugs against induce) and liquids (to prevent a fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood constellation were changed or during which certain other side effects, the treatment should be reduced, or the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetreiterates the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetreboxed in its active form goes easier than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of pharmaceutical and long-term effect in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was investigated in a main study at 456 patients who had no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study had been treated with local advanced or metastatic disease, who had previously reported in chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (one other medicines against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was compared with gemcitabine (other medicines against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study at 1 725 patients who had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin patients, at an average of 12,1 months, compared to 9.3 months at all Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously preserved an chemotherapy, the average survivors of Alimta 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, in both studies, cancer of cancer does not apply the record epital cells, when using Alimta longer survival times longer than with the comparison of comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2367">September 2004, the European Commission approved the European Commission to Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a approval for the intraffic of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every breakwater bottle must be upgraded with 4,2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9mg / ml), which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary Do- sis will be taken from the dimming bottle and with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9mg / ml) to 100 ml. (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is in combination with Cisplatin indicated for the first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in the two-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body upper floor space (KOF) is administered than intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day of treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of Cisplatine is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an information about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day every 21 day of treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2374">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered than intravenous infusion as an intravenous infusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 days treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As a result, the prevalence of Hautreads must be given a day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-gift, as well as the day after treatment a cortikosteroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose, Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 cans of folic acid and the intake must be resumed during the entire period of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third one.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who received Pemetrexed, should be created before any time a complete blood model, including a differentiation of leukcytes and a platelets tctcensus.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate Transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new therapy cycle, there must be a dose check under Berrious - the Nadirs of blood cells or the maximum non-domestic toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">According to the recovery, the patient must be treated according to the notes in tables 1, 2 and 3 for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grad 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Patients non-heroological toxicity ≥ degree 3 develop (excluding neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted by the patient before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled after 2 dose, or non-heredological toxicity or non-domestic toxicity. 3 or 4 occurs or occurrences at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neural oxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 of the age of 65 or higher compared to patients were an increase of effective secondary application area.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for children under 18 years due to sufficient data for unconditional and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials were necessary in patients with a ciratinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, not required for all those of the recommended Dosisons.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data is not enough for patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction from &gt; 1.5 times of the upper limit value (with absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 fold-out of the upper limit value (when presence of Lebermetastasen) are not investigated in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be surprised in regard to the bone of bone and pemetrexed, before whose absolute neutrophilencount again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cytencount again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilology, Thrombozytenment and the maximum non-toxic toxicity, such as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and reduction in degrees 3 / 4 hermatological toxicity as Neutropenie, febec Neutropenie and infection with Grade 3 / 4 Neutropenie was found if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all of all patients treated with pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 can be used as prophylactic scale. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with lighter to medium-insufficium (nuts 45 to 79 ml / min), the simultaneous non-recurrent antiphyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) must avoid treatment for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and underwater treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who is intended for a therapy with poemetrexed, the intake of NSAIDs offer long half-value for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with emetreboxed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who were initiated in those events had corresponding risk factors for recording of renal events, including elongation or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinical significant reduction - Ansata in transitions space a drainage of the result before the pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious kardiovascular events, including Myokardinfarities, and cerebrovasculinary events were reported in clinical studies, when this active substance is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the same application attendees is not recommended (except yellow fever that vaccination is contra) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible hammer of reproduction through Pemetrexed, men should be submitted before the treatment - Ginn, consulting services regarding the sperm preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (ciratinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroidyllic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a decreased Pemetrexed separating with a result of a multiple initiation of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, if in patients with normal renal function (ciratinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and mines- tens 2 days after the therapy with poemetrexed can be avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-value as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the same application must be used for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with perpenalties.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oralen antibodies and antineastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance of the INR (International Regulations ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are currently no data for the use of Pemetrexed at pigs, but as in ande- antimetabolites are expected in the pregnancy heavy birth defective.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy, unless necessarily, and after careful footage of the user for the mother and risk of risk for the Fötus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible ratchet by Pemetrelies, men should be submitted before the treatment of treatment, consulting on Spermasters.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known, whether Pemetrexed in breast milk goes and irresistible effects in stillary infant cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be used by an additional Gticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as antiemetically).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because of effects in this age group has not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the efficacy of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as Serotonin), which prevents the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemotherapies received, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and omiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and exhausting, 59% of patients who had been treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no achieving (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and omiting, showed 81% of patients who had been treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no headache (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission approved the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the intraffic of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: the prevention of acute nausea and exhausting with strong chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of disaster chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and proceeding, which will be strengthened by a strong emetogeneous chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one of the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thicknessing passage in patients with an amnesty fruit or signs of an subakovarian Ileus after injection moldy.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, the QT interval extend or in patients who extends the QT interval extend or in those that QT- interval is extended or to lead to such a extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Apart from the connection with an additional chemotherapeutics-gift Aloxi in the days after chemotherapy neither to preventive the treatment of nausea and omiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron was not investigated against the tumours of the five investigations of chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cytarabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study demonstrated no significant pharmaceutical dose between an influenced intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static concentration of an CYP2D6-inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population-based molecular analysis, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, oxides (Amiethylum, oxides in, Haloperidol, oxides, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) no significant effect on Clearance from Palonosetron had no significant effect.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not allowed, so it should not be used as palonosetron in pigs, unless it is necessary to be treated as required.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms to be found side effects (altogether 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in relation to headache (9%) and orchestation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of oversensitive relocality and reactions to stay (burning, curing, complaints and pain) were given in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed a similar frequency of uncertainty events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effects relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the big distribution volume, but no effective therapy is presumably no effective therapy at a Aloxiety.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind study, a total of 1,132 patients who received a standard-related chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-time 3.5 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours), which was added to day 1 without Dexamethason intravenously.</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of studies with visual chemotherapy and the study with strong emetra chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indications chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were similar to Palonosetron, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc Intervalls with the appropriate effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical trials, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ventricular de- and repolarization of Ionosetron and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study of 221 healthy volunteers conducted the assessment of EKG effects from i.v. administered palonosetron from 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous medication follows a slow Elimination in the body with an average terminations of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and the surface under the concentration camp (AUC0- ∞) is generally proportionately in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg of healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous casting from Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 Hodenkarcinoma between day 1 and Day 5 measured average (± SD) ascent of Palonosetron Plasmaconia at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmaceutical simulations proceeding that the value of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron came to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the unique intravenous remuneration of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the cmax after one of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys eliminated and about another 50% will be converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 at the Metabolism are involved in Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron have been found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in Urine, Palonosetron, made approximately 40% of the total dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolusinjury in healthy, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver function, the terminal Eliminationshutory and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron, a reduction of the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials were observed only after expositions, which are considered insufficient above the maximum human therapeutic index, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From the clinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can be blocks only in a very high concentration of Ionosetron, which extend to the ventricular de- and repearization.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose included in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in human beings) that were given to a multiple prevalence of liver trans, hypophyse, pankreas, adjacent, adjacent, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used tall dosages and there is Aloxi by humans the relevance of these results are low as for people.</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were distracted that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the substance and knowledge of pharmaceutical.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferone-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting of the treatment with Alpheon inflamed the disease more than in reference to the reference-products; the aleon had more adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from it was seen in the study review to the investigation of the question, inwieveit the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body makes antibody - special proteins - against the medicine), not enough validate.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for treatment of Impetigo (a crucible skin infection) and small inficated Lazarations (Rissor or Schnittwentions), can be used in need of needs and precise wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treatment of infections, the subsequent or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because algo against this kind of infections may not work.</seg>

<seg id="2680">In the treatment of inficated hoists showed altargo and Cefalexin similar to the results: if the results of these results were estimated at Hautwentions, they said about 90% of patients in groups of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, Altargo was found that the altargo with the treatment of toszessen (wounds in the body tissue) or infections were caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adjacent effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation of the client.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanity of Humanity (CHMP) showed that the benefits of Altargo with the following surface treatment of skin infections were transferred to the risks of the following surface treatment. • Impetigo, • infected small Lazarations, filments or sewn.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission adopted the European Commission to Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the intraffic of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosisadjustment is not required if topical Retapamulin in a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors is used.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Tierstudien have shown a reproduction of reproductive and are inadequate in relation to effect on the birth and the fötale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2698">Effects of Retapamulin is a semi synthetic derivate of pleuromutilin, a substrates that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (former Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial cancer of the 50S sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosoms which differs from the binder of other ribosomal interaction antibacterial fabrics.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicated that the Bindings ribosomales protein L3 will be involved in the region of ribosomal P-Bindings and the Peptidyltransferasecentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding at this jumprings, Pleuromutiline the pepontidyltransfer, blocks partly P binder interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">In the reason of the local prevalence resistance of resistance to retapamulin at least some infectious forms, should be advised by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin in opposite to S.aureus, regardless of it, whether the isolate is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-speaking response to the treatment of S.aureus should be considered the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (like PVL = Panton-Valentine, Leucocidin).</seg>

<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be used in the framework of a two doses existing vaccine, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after leaving the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix must be used if during immunisation, a low risk of hepatitis B infection is made and safely, that of two doses existing Vaccine can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collecting dose for hepatitis A or B is required, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or -B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work when using the immune system (the natural scale of the body), "how it can attack against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child the vaccine, the immune system uses the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and generates antibody in contrast.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adults and the Twinrix children since 1996.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children will administered form three different doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults are identical ingredients, some of data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicators for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had a month after the last injection of antibody concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a 6-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection of anti-based antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambirix was similar to a hexagonal and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine tubes), headaches, appetite angel, pain (fatigue) and maturity.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix must be react with patients who can react (allergic) on the active substances, one of the other components or Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2739">The stability plan for the pricelist with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given to the choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection of hepatitis A also desired to hepatitis B desired, the vaccination can be vaccinated with a combination of vaccination or combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-hepatitis B) and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are observed in the same size of vaccination using the respective monovaline accidents.</seg>

<seg id="2743">3 How to all injection materials should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic response according to the indication of the vaccination of medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardimentation is recommended that includes 360 ELISA-units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinantes hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">For heralysepatients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, requires a sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of another vaccinations can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an inorganic injecting or intramuscular disinfection could lead to an suboptimal impurities, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenie or bleeding interference cannot be injected, since it may occur in these cases after intramuscular gabe.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second living year in the form of a separate diphtherie- and haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- Mumps-vaccine accine was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients under immunoressiver therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that there is no adequate immune response.</seg>

<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambient was compared to the 3 cans combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matalence to a calculation basis per vaccine dose. but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of subjects, compared to 39,1% of subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 cans combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccine cycle reported 66.4% of subjects who had been administered about pain, compared with 63,8% in subjects, which were used by the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Matalence was however comparable high level (i.e. above the entire vaccine cycle with 39,6% of subjects, the Ambirix profession, compared with 36,2% of subjects, which received the 3 cans combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of distinctive pain and matalence was low and comparable to reduce the combination of combination with the 3 cans vaccine ema.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- 11-year-old impetus was similar to locally interactions and allergies with a 360 ELISA-units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombination pepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for 6 to 11 years old, however, according to Ambirix was a common order of pain (at injection point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of impetus to reduce the severe side effects during the 2 cans vaccine with Ambirix, or during the 3-cans vaccines hepatitis-A-Virus and 10 µg recombination pepatitis-B- Surface antigen reported, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials which were conducted at Impairingen in the age of 1 to 15 years, the Seroconverter rates for anti-HAV 99.1% one month after the second, for the month 6 administered dose (i.e. the month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The SeroConverter rates for Anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month 6 administered dose (i.e. the month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually taking into consideration of protein tolerances and for growth and development of daily protein content of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the former clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg and with an extra-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifestation in Carbamylphosphatetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, is the substitution of Citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinate synthetase-lack of arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets are not given to patients with snake interference, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera there is no risk to get instantly in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore increase in patients with congestive cardiovinsufficiency or heavier Niereninsufficiency with sodium retention and economist clinical trials are only used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat, the liver and kidneys takes place, the AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney insufficiently only with the first supervision.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results are not known in relation to pregnant women; the use of AMMONAPS is therefore trailed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subkutaner gift of phenylacetate to young rats (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal distribution and a stacked loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delimated maturation of cerebral synapses and a decrease of nerves in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected, if phenylacetate in humans are separated from the mother's breast milk, and from this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contra-contra (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS entered at 56% of patients at least one uncertainly event (AE) and at 78% of this unwanted events were assumed that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorean patient, which developed a metabolic enzphalopathy in conjunction with Lakier socket, heavy hypokalemia, armor Neuropathy and pankreatitis developed.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdoering occurred in a 5 months old small child with a total dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">This symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed an dosshootoxicity of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolism with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is based on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically is comparable, phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 embroidatoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative bearers to exclusion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with interruptions of the urinary cycle can be accepted that for each gram of the sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis was early for early and treatment immediately started to improve survival results and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the dismanifestation of the disease was almost always infall, and the disease resulted in treatment with Peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen free illoga within the first year of death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By Hämodialysis, the exploitation of alternatives of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium chloride, and sodium chloride concentration was possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (but within the first lifetime) of diagnosed illness to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy, and the survival rate was 100%, but the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patient came with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with late manifestation of the disease (including soft patients with the heterozygotes form of Ornithintranscarbamylase-Mangels) that were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinreduced diet, was the survival rate of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly rectly and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate to phenylacetate is oxidized in liver and kidney cleanymatisch with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat, and in patients with interruptions of urea cycle, of hemogloans and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was examined according to intravenous disease of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after intake measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary fatigue cyclic or hemoglobinopathies, after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after a nightmare, not a phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cells that were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three singles), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in Plasmaspiegel on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Differentiation of the medication is approximately 80-100% in the form of the economist phenylacetylglutamine on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat was treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after orally attempt from a single dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is placed either oral (infants and children, which can't be found any tablets, or patients with sysfunction) or a Gastrocker or a Nasensonde.</seg>
