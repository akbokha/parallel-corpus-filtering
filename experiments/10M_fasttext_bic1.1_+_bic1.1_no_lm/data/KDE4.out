&amp; dig@@ m ; used the program g@@ Phot@@ o2 to communication with digital camera support for digital cameras that supports a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported . g@@ Phot@@ o2 also has been a wides@@ pre@@ ad protocol that enables the transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the computer . there are typically large files are now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Phot@@ o2 through a complete list of supported cameras in this link .

what is a digital constitu@@ tional administration - apart from the Mo@@ de@@ y ? digital inventory administration is considered to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records a form of digital components administration . most of us do not do this in a system@@ atic and efficient kind and fashion .
we give you a tool to secure your image and practical tips such as you can find and use photos . please consider the program for digital phot@@ ograph and use photos . we consider the download , backup , backup , file , ass@@ ist , waiting , waiting , wait , and export files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory administration takes place , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , se@@ ar@@ ches , trans@@ formed , assembled and exp@@ orted content that have a mon@@ o@@ ars or cultural value hab@@ es.@@ quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition , information about or a documentation of other data provided by application or environment .
I W@@ age to claim when you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , you need not want to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t want to store all the met@@ ad@@ ata available in a database as well as in the image files and a secure archiv@@ ing on which you can access to other programs , platforms and formats free .
the first what you do and know what you want to offer any system structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to select whether you want to save on your photos , or on a network drives , or on a network drives you want to change anything on a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your memory location . if you have enough photos , then you will need sub@@ ordin@@ ner like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export . export is then a file for pictures which you can print or on a web site .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as versi@@ oning photos , archiv@@ ing , working group of images on different them@@ es and a large number of all . within 10 years are 95 % archives and 5 % working files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kind of files are fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate the new files .
the separation of original and working Files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . they are always know if you are looking for a original or derived picture .
we also recommend the Met@@ ad@@ ata option to activ@@ ate the Met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ i on the file . if you forget , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files you can select the appropriate point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? well , to do you want to do your met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ butes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you can select all the photos that you need all the images that you need all the images that you will select the same attri@@ bute , and then you will start the best with the ranking or the ranking . this makes sense that you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now proceed with key@@ words , as you like to continue with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ on@@ ym@@ es for the same thing .
if you need to import images from a different source with embedded sample , then you will find the images to the right place . the change of Hier@@ archy is no problem and can easily be able to move through the tree of a under@@ way . the changed key words are pursu@@ ed by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; updated during it the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very gro@@ be Re@@ presentation , since every block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . filename and calendar dates to all photos .
enough the key@@ words - the next section rel@@ ates to damages or comments on the third important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they want to see most of your photos , you want to see you with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and ag@@ encies . they are sec@@ ure@@ ly interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . from the ferry it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you see it closer to see some details , people , space .
and now I say to you this the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , associations , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . all its perc@@ eption which has been completely changed .
for other pictures of your photos , the title possibly look more important than the image itself to create a story . think it is to help us to help us the meaning of the viewer , Him to understand what you understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a damage to work alone .
with &amp; dig@@ i am ; you can also exp@@ ose a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alph@@ abet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , it can also be exp@@ orted to your wishes into the corru@@ ption and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you must tell the history for the open action no second time .
remember the times in front of GPS ? as you find in another city without navigation system , it was not a long @-@ residence planet before goo@@ gle Earth ? well , because of images drives the sp@@ ati@@ al presentation of the sp@@ ati@@ al presentation now with light speed .
you can also download the possibilities the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation in the future , you can also be de@@ ep@@ able in the future , you can open your travels to the future . you can also convert K@@ ML files you can also export your travels to Gall@@ er@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and re@@ ferred to use the copyright rights to remove lim@@ itations through the distribution and amend@@ ment of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms apply in all versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description says you would like to be information in the alignment page of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; as information is required :
author ( syn@@ on@@ ym for invent@@ ories and author ) : this field should be used to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. if it is not desired , the name of a company or organisation must not be changed . this field supports neither Comm@@ as nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ating character .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( Syn@@ on@@ ym for author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the study designation of the photographer , volunte@@ er photographer , volunte@@ er photograph@@ ers , or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the author feld , this also has to be filled with this .
Editor ( Syn@@ on@@ ym for provi@@ ders ) : use the provider field to identify the phot@@ ograph or Associated Press , then the image has to be listed here if the image has been here . if the image has a bearing photo , then here the group / agency will be given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections . each of these no protection against ab@@ use , delete or change . the solution for this problem is a little watermark . for private individuals , this is intended for those of your photos only by low interest . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital watermark is one of the first time . &amp; dig@@ i am ; it is available in the near future a module for st@@ acking processing .

we did not talk about CDs die on the street or fire . this type of losses are the same as well as traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is possible to have problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data rest@@ ore company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
to com@@ bat the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to get them more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archiv@@ ed quality . there are offers about Gold Co@@ ated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that can claim a life time of 100 years for themselves . if you believe in your choice .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good notes as the cheapest type , but you can write much tru@@ ce . it turns out to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very an@@ due for error , even if you just have just written only . they are just effective data , the rest we need for form@@ at@@ ting and the control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection , it is required for the form@@ at@@ ening and the control cabinet . despite this massive protection , ultr@@ as@@ ettes light , cr@@ ater , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favor@@ able program called I@@ so Bu@@ ster it works well as CDs and DVDs ; but is still not for Mac@@ s available . there are also similar applications to damaged hard disks , hard disks , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
Optical media : Blu @-@ ray disc se@@ em to capture the format war against the HD DVD to win almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything is said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn with a good capture device in a non @-@ propri@@ etary media in one non @-@ propri@@ etary files . don &apos;t forget the data to the next generation of media , you don &apos;t forget the data to the next generation of media or software that can read these media .
a disk manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer properties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a great field study about the bug Mechan@@ is@@ ms of hard drives : Disk@@ f@@ erst@@ u@@ das
in brief : dis@@ playing at the longest if you are operated in the Tem@@ per@@ ate range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the most common error occurred . this is the most common error occurred . these are particularly reading and publishing meter . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just a complete losses due to over@@ voltage of over voltage . you can also secured data loss due to a power fail@@ ure before you can eventually produce the files without a big problems .
whereas most electrical devices current size does not take much to make devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes , complete mot@@ herboards , Hard@@ ware@@ houses , destroyed mot@@ herboards and other def@@ ects . protect himself up to a loss of time and money .
most common protection against power tips is a over@@ load protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bing a part of energy saving is absor@@ bed and the rest is normally in the form of a slot bar . remember that any connector strip also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should also meet the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures that it offers a certain minimum of protection . you should also protects the protection against flash plants and therefore protects the properly connected devices .
because an over@@ voltage of each cables can be connected to your computer , you should also be protected by telephone lines . this also applies to telephone cables and cable mod@@ ems . some manufacturers can also include telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable mod@@ ems and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these tools are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . it &apos;s ideal for the way .
while an over@@ load protection of your system is not really help . even a fail@@ ure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ specified data . it can therefore be mean@@ ing@@ ful to inv@@ est in a interru@@ p@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ voltages , these devices may automatically move into consider@@ ation up to the power . if you want to use your data to the power . if you have a UPS to be sure that they might be the same quality requirements like a over@@ load protection . furthermore , the life @-@ time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
if you have chosen the potential risk , which your computer system is set up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can you need for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a smaller price difference if you should remember the computer . finally , you should always think any cable to tr@@ enne before you drive into your holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with any quantities .
they are very expensive to home , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore just as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it &apos;s not a bad solution but it &apos;s not a general safety solution . this is it too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com is available online store on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dram@@ ati@@ cally . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage that should be re@@ viewed in reality .
from the view of the data backup , the web solutions are highly secure . transfer error will automatically adjusted automatically and to the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are possible for transfer error . the file system is at least the data integ@@ r@@ ity between operating system and hard drive .
the wor@@ st thing is that no one has never notic@@ ed if a transfer error occurred . all these dis@@ orders will remain un@@ quiet until you would have thought on any day . No one seems to have thought that it seems to have thought on the internet with his TCP protocol . it is much more safe data way than the computer in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transm@@ issions , since they generate interval within the data flow . during normal data systems , this error is un@@ notic@@ ed .
even if you are currently affected by transmission problems , you should see in the future . for 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micros@@ ystems appears one of two candidates and highly scal@@ able . it &apos;s open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one for G@@ PL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . Read this article in English .
Oracle has started a own initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
do not estimate these two factors for 86 % of the data loss in the Not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work systems for not@@ ebooks , the share of dens@@ ities are 50 % .
data loss due to vir@@ uses is less wides@@ pre@@ ad than the master@@ ing . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few vir@@ uses and under Linux ; it has been no longer as@@ sured .
open source file systems are less prepar@@ atory for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel f@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the wides@@ pre@@ ad file systems . a very good English article here .
Journ@@ aling file systems prevent data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the trial period during an operation is higher and a un@@ defined status , but if a file is not completely stored before the problem , it is lost .
vir@@ uses are the largest thre@@ at for digital data : false , the@@ ft and human error , the main cause for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 flas@@ hing settings from fundam@@ ental physical limits . it is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and volume characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in direction of the 10 meg@@ apixels sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optim@@ ally for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have the limit of 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixels . for higher resolutions need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk you can receive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not require any data loss for data loss . secure your data is affected by any data loss as the re@@ installation of your operating system , change the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , one day , a flash , you &apos;re lu@@ cky enough if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a Des@@ aster pro@@ poses local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and po@@ eb@@ ble are dangerous enough . they usually enter a whole room or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ s always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses the steps up to the neigh@@ bo@@ urs , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , is a common reason for a loss of the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup , but if you have a backup , then you can save the day .
full backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a moment without Hist@@ orie and presents a complete copy at a time .
differential Ass@@ urance : one backup of the files which has been changed since the last complete control . creates a complete torque recording at two time points : the complete control and the last differential fuse .
ink@@ re@@ mental securing : one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . once again we produce the original status at any time . this fuse comes to a versi@@ oning system at the next with the exception that it is not ongoing - not ongoing .
R@@ sync is a wonderful small tool you can easily evalu@@ ate your machines . in contrast to the script controlled FTP or other types of file transfer encod@@ ings . this happens to the difference of the files . this happens , and if you want to increase the security over ss@@ h .
secure your important pictures directly after you have saved on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach can be enough to discover the time to discover losses and again . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly mom@@ ents for each month . every additional information should be done manual , after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , associated with files stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , associated with images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , view@@ ers , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will surprise the next 40 years , because they are really interested in you are interested in your child@@ hood or youth , there are two strateg@@ ies that should be considered :
since the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you will consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to vote at the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to vote as the current system back@@ ward . however , less variations in the past , it is so easier to evalu@@ ate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the ex@@ plan@@ ations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that your paintings are important , then store it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other side the Council is quite easy : any@@ time if you want to change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses technology , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change one system in its size . this means always enlar@@ ge .
let &apos;s go out of it that you want to set the scal@@ ability , and the range you want to put up on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer to a new plate .
check the d@@ mes@@ g if your new plate has been recognized from the system , but it is not one .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC , the new plate is / dev / S@@ DC , the new plate is / dev / S@@ DC and the size of the panel in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # changing the size of travel if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if any day does not read more software , then you can create this job . this task is easier to sim@@ pler for year too .
GIF is a propri@@ etary format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG was an open source standard developed as an open source standard , but it is much more . it is los@@ ing , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , but not as many administration formats , but not as many as TIFF are needed and a slow comp@@ ress . this format want to store you to save your pictures .
TIFF was wides@@ pre@@ ad as a picture format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of compression alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm . there is a problem that this format may be adapted in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The digital neg@@ atives format is a license @-@ free and open RAW format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is now available on the basis of met@@ ad@@ ata . it is now available on the basis of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competition Canon and Nikon it even somet@@ ime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology , which allows users to replace the &apos; 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information are stored in a file . file information is stored with extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers in front of your photo , mostly in the raw format which saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file , and the image file will come from the image file and the image file will cover the raw format . therefore you should consider if you want to use as container and everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation that support for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ at@@ en@@ standards , discussions and cultural work in the DC@@ MI production groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and compet@@ itions to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ en@@ standards and intern@@ s .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images are using the camera system , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save this in your re@@ pository . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine treatment you can use external programs . if you work the pictures again with &amp; dig@@ m ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut off among the other programs .
prot@@ ecting the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , encod@@ ing in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ m ; in the passage of a record you can add a description as you can add you to your hard disk , you can add many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album files .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ m ; use this with the computer , activ@@ ate the camera on the indic@@ ating mode and switch them . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it is trying to appear with your camera . if the connection is made , a F@@ erti@@ g @-@ Indi@@ c@@ ator is available . if this is the case , the filename , and a symbol for any file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you need to view the camera form@@ ations on each entry . with the sliding properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a details or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows the file properties and the photo information related to the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not downloaded from the camera . please note that at some digital cameras not all information are available .
the Rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS etc . the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata page bar from the main window of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ on ; or the image processing . please note that the met@@ ad@@ ata could not be available at some digital cameras .
the eas@@ i@@ est way to download photos on their computers , the click on the button and then select the selection of all camera in a single album in &amp; dig@@ m ; . Download the pictures will be downloaded from your camera to be downloaded in a album before you will delete the pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; please choose the button download and then selection Selected . the knob Selected is long as long as you have chosen some photos .
if your camera is it supported , is an option of new download . these pictures were not yet available for download . if you want to select the new pictures with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to select the buttons , select a dialog that will be displayed in the photos . the list of existing albums will be displayed , as usual folder , displayed . details for Ord@@ n@@ ers@@ or@@ ate you can read the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; dig@@ i ; inv@@ ites the pictures from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all of the camera . if you want to delete the button . if you want to select some delete , you need to select this first and delete .
NOTE that there is no possibility to recover from the camera that you will be deleted from the camera . you should be fully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to remove the camera battery . if you want to make the camera shooting , because this is much faster than the camera .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos are not excep@@ tionally excep@@ tionally well . these can be added to the same album . so it can be mean@@ ing@@ ful to integ@@ rate the date and time to integ@@ rate the picture in the filename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the picture and for date based under@@ lines . if you are using this latter option , will automatically be created automatically a folder per day .
the options during the transfer opens three more options that are done before the author in the Section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ ent@@ ity . if you select the relevant entries from the ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . using the last option you can finish the date and time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different file format as the default format , you can use e.g. in the processing field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . switch the option date &amp; time . for additional adjust@@ ments should read the help of the command .
if you want to use the camera file names , you have the possibility to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case . or in large case , if you prefer .
the new filename , used &amp; dig@@ m ; for a photo , will be displayed below the name , the camera is stored in the preview . your settings will be stored and automatically when you can open the next time the camera window .
&amp; dig@@ i on ; can all information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic turning during the down@@ loading . not all cameras are ready for information on the camera bar . in the section page row Met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details on the information which has embedded camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera is not enabled , and dig@@ ic@@ am ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic turning off , use button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
if your camera is made more information on the date , to the photo taken , &amp; dig@@ m can be downloaded on the image data . all images with the same date . do not hes@@ itate to read these information . in the section page of Met@@ a Data , you can read more information about your camera in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , the photos can switch directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need this option . use the button extension based on the lower end of the window .
the eas@@ i@@ est way photos of your computer to load their camera is Download . choose the file selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears to select the files that you can select the files that you can select more than a file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the picture selection , as@@ ks &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you , where the pictures will be loaded up . please select the desired folders and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position to be displayed in length and latitude . the determination of data can be done by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photo prints , it is interesting to link a picture with more precise @-@ geograph@@ ical place . not everyone is an aircraft by automatic recording of the GPS data to kar@@ to@@ gra@@ fi@@ res . environmental pl@@ anner , military , police , architecture office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you don &apos;t forget the picture where you want to open a browser that you can find a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ i ; users can send the place of the photos , or simply only these aspect rati@@ os , it is good about the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ iner@@ aries and map refer@@ ences . the question is so much more , how the data processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I Module for the geograph@@ ical information ( manual ) and the latest manual transmission of known places .
if we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit . but there is a few that can work with GPS receivers . either as map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ o@@ h Pro G3 Sony
the download of GPS data from one device can store with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to store these data in the g@@ px format , because this is the only format is supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are more different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and latitude or other data , you can use these scri@@ pts that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign of coordinates that use m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; dig@@ m ; tries to access you as much control about its working processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; dig@@ i ; setting up settings like this settings . you can choose between these settings by changing the symbols of the left side .
action can choose a preview or image processing can be set up or image processing . they put the standard behaviour of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; fir@@ m@@ ly when you click on a entry in the main view .
this page contains as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and ur@@ h@@ ted data . these data are written automatically into the respective IP@@ TC data fields , if the data can be synchroni@@ zation from the camera line . also the data can be synchron@@ ised in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ on@@ ym for author : this field should be the professional name of photograph@@ ers . these can be a freel@@ ance photographer , freel@@ ance photographer , or independent photographer . since this is a further information about the author , must also be filled .
the editor is a syn@@ on@@ ym for vend@@ or : use this field to specify the same as such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then this image has been here to be listed here as the image has a bearing photo , then the group should be counted here for the image , then here the image will be counted here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC fields , so that the met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . these met@@ ad@@ ata also may be imp@@ orted to other programs and can be imp@@ orted in &amp; dig@@ m .
image described in JPEG images are related to JPEG images in JPEG images : this is synchroni@@ zes the comments to create your photos from other image files . attention : at pictures , descri@@ bing the compl@@ aints are contained by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
the page settings are all options for information that appear on the mouse button in the main window over a file . according to the chosen option this information is indicated or not .

the default settings can be back again , turning the button to the right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire by &amp; dig@@ m on this page can be switched on this page . if you have switched on this page . if you have enabled , different sizes and synchroni@@ zed mode is not available . if you have one of the picture screen saver ; you should only use only on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better view .
by default the image processing of a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer another color , you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you can use the image processing in full screen mode .
over and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or brig@@ hter colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing can be set up here with F@@ 10 and F11 .
with Chrom@@ a sub@@ sampling is common that the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance is encod@@ ed as in the Far@@ bin@@ oc@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia .
with the setting PNG files you can reduce the size of PNG files to reduce the image quality , as PNG a lost @-@ free alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm . if you have a fast computer , you can use this value to a high compression ratio . it means 1 : a low and 9 compression .
with the option of TIFF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it is no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm lost .
with the setting @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can choose to store the ratio between quality loss and file size far better than the normal JPEG . as this paragraph was not supported , but met@@ ad@@ ata was not supported in planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; dig@@ i , the image processing was only a image viewer for photos . currently there is very fast to a tool to man@@ ip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default value is that all the green pixels of the CCD sensor is expressed as the pixels of un@@ loading lines . if you need this option to solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is the picture a little soft , elim@@ inated the 2x2 circle pattern with the VN@@ G or the AHD quality meth@@ ode .
if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if the automatic sh@@ balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is it possible to use a solid color balance , which is based on a white map in the sun@@ light .
this setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that get the popular images in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras , it will be ig@@ no@@ red .
the default is the nick@@ name , so the parts of your images are bur@@ ned down to consider as a continuous white in the settings . to set the setting in various ros@@ es . last , you can try to re@@ construc@@ t some parts of the missing information from the po@@ ems .
this is possible because blue pixel are not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and d@@ c@@ raw are therefore the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option you will select the possibility to set a level of three a com@@ promise and can be adjusted separately for every image .
use the lumin@@ ance value after your taste . you must set him something higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; dig@@ i ; -@@ image processing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing small , you should cons@@ ume you .
an Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing -@@ alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the color image sensor that provides many cameras and the matrix colored pixel are also available as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; dig@@ m at your disposal : Bil@@ de@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and AHD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of Gra@@ di@@ ents ) was the first alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of the D@@ c@@ raw material . he creates colour art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you are a fast solution with an accept@@ able result .
if you know the color deviation of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can find Rot@@ - and Blue correc@@ tions values here . this is surely the best method for a soft correction which is performed during the resource conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the Far@@ bin@@ oc@@ ations and returns to these again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; information such as Far@@ bin@@ oc@@ ations of one color space in the others are thus possible as possible .
behaviour issues if a picture in the image processing is opened / colour administr@@ ator module with raw files .
colour profile file sharing here the folder , like e.g. / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you want to save all your profiles . &amp; dig@@ i ; exam@@ ines these folders during the start .
here you have the option of the ICC profiles here are the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color restri@@ ction view is an alternative to X@@ H@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your paintings are un@@ folded to the entire screen .
the input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturer and Modell . there are some profiles that contain any color m@@ apping or gam@@ ble correction . currently correc@@ ts d@@ c@@ raw Gamma not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform paint m@@ apping itself .
there are more options as the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to figure out what your printer can be back on your camera as your printer can be better than your camera and some colors are very saturated . this might be manually correc@@ ted , instead of the blind alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite ob@@ viously , the color profile for them is why not intended for the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profil@@ ing them . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension allows the style to recogni@@ ze the style : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ utral , P for Port@@ ra@@ it@@ und S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plug@@ in interface . it &apos;s a interface that can support from a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image review and image processing . many modules support the K@@ IP@@ I interface , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I Mod@@ ules , you will see a list of available modules . select the list that you want to use , and these modules will find as new entries in the menu of the main and beyond that will find some even in the context menu of the plan menu .

besides the use button , there is a button more . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . but this is always done when you have a met@@ ad@@ at@@ en@@ Setting the pictures are always written into the images .
the valuation shows a value sch@@ eme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and ass@@ emb@@ lies . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 star in the page row or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . reviews , select these pictures at the same time and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field urg@@ ency . the coding follows the sch@@ eme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box to fil@@ tering the key@@ words , the key@@ words and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; dig@@ am ; -@@ session .
the subject tree is adapted to the given search word . you can check out the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word fast . this ability is particularly useful when you have many j@@ aws .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief on the input of a picture series . if you have different fil@@ words , these are stored for fast access .
simil@@ arly , the key@@ words can also be set within the tree . all the key@@ words of a picture will be stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view , and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ words , this is not only on the high@@ ligh@@ ted picture , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the tool@@ bar fe@@ eder filter is used to change the selection of the main window images with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views are used as additionally as one or more key@@ word filter from the right hand , only the cutting quantity of these two works are available .
you can also go key@@ words and put it . if the key@@ word already exists , you can pull it with sti@@ ffer . if the key@@ word already exists , you can find it from the right side strip , and put it to the choice when you are asked if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is available on three pictures . they were selected with Ctr@@ l + a , and then there was a key@@ word from the right hand tree to the choice and there was a dialogue , whether this key@@ word will be placed .
these search for changes will be held at every start of the program . you can also be switched on settings of different settings .
if you have a rule with and created so that it may be one or his greatest , you can change this easily with double click on the text and control .

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for these work . I &apos;ve got mainly to &amp; dig@@ i ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you have a colour@@ ful work@@ flow in the colors of your camera or sc@@ anners , you can reach a predic@@ table deviation from your camera or sc@@ anners , the colors are printed on your camera or sc@@ anners same as well as the colors are the colors or in the web pages of your digital dark @-@ chamber .
if the theme of color administration is , then any knowledge is to set up for the results . the sense of this tut@@ orials it has to be adequ@@ ate background information about colour administration . in addition , you should get your links with de@@ ep@@ tive dec@@ isions to meet your own inform@@ ational dec@@ isions to meet the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow will be fulfilled all six bottom , then you must not take care of color administration .
you can work at a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other pictures are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB is good works and life for all that simple , why should you do another color space which do you need to do beyond colour man@@ or ?
a visual example of the limit of s@@ RGB compared to the colors which we can see below . it shows a 2 dimensional display of all colors , which we can see the hu@@ fe@@ is@@ en@@ ular region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional presentation of s@@ RGB with some greater colour space , you visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms recogni@@ ze page and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working spaces .
do I need to work my monitor with my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
Yes ! if you want to work in the s@@ ni@@ an color space or not , you need to work your monitor . if you need to use your monitor . if you need to use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , you need either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitors or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions available to improve the picture in most cases . use it before you can att@@ empt@@ ing a further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ ali@@ zing , dispens@@ ing , automatic and contrast from the menu correc@@ ted automatic correction are automatically em@@ ented automatically from your colors the best . you will need to see the best effects on your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the leu@@ stron@@ gest point black and the brig@@ ht@@ est point is as bright as possible without sh@@ ady rest . this function is often a magic correction for images the dark or washed .
in the same way : this method adjusted the illumin@@ ated colors of the colors of the selected image . sometimes the same number of pixels that thus produces very good results with the improvement of the con@@ formity of an image , sometimes it produces only litter . it is a very powerful operation that works either mir@@ acles with a picture or it destroyed .
automatic copy : this method maxim@@ iz@@ ing the color area in the Rot@@ - , green and blue@@ channel . you have been determined the dark and bright mar@@ g@@ inal and bright border to the complete history .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the move of the lowest and highest values of all values between . this is only visible by balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; dig@@ m ; is a sem@@ i@@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white balance correction is a bit limited to about an color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform a white balance within the raw mode , if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which allows for correction to correction better than 16 bit mode .
this tool is based on a white balance by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it over the menu entry white balance of white balance .
the advance window can be adjusted in the size . on the left side are adapted to see the preview of the goal . if you want to see the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original version , then it is to click on the window .
the preview of the target company has a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this mark@@ ers will be displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is indicated that dynam@@ ically modified , once you want to change an parameters . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because they can deci@@ de whether one of the three colors or your sum will be shown . the total is called Lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result is depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the sh@@ adows can be adjusted to improve your photos or down d@@ imm@@ en .
An@@ stat with the above @-@ mentioned controls , should use the color pipette . press the color chart to use this button and then click on this type to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . to this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed aggregate increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els . you will receive the combined results in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and store make this . every setting of the white balance , you can store it into a text file and later again .
the button viewer sets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . please note that your original settings will be changed as your original image . if you want to image your original image .
you can adjust the co@@ di@@ date depth per color channel of the working image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding are also better for high @-@ quality images . this coding are also suitable for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool gives the same dialogue such as the processing of raw image . it uses the change and the assign@@ ing of color profile . color m@@ apping can be carried out by the window for the help of color profile you can draw the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu of colours . this tool allows you to adjust the same way to adjust the same mist@@ ake if your camera can make your camera and you always need the same correc@@ ted . in the manual for the loudspeaker @-@ correct structure you can find more information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool to Gr@@ ad@@ ation that you can find under paints and menu .
the &amp; dig@@ i on ; tool colour effects provides you four colors effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a neon effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar power , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the color , a effect of the color , the color , dark areas were elim@@ inated by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the picture what chem@@ ically is possible . a further increase was finally re@@ produce a negative image that is not to produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar installation . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect from the colours . try it simple , he is beautiful many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a daylight optimized color film by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Velvet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for his smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as is strong in different colors , but also some photographer , especially those that are hardly landscapes .
the Ne@@ on@@ filters sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast ratio . the parameters controls the brightness of the results and the ar@@ thritis of the Ne@@ on@@ light . in large images , the filters can be loaded the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras have commonly resol@@ ved problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color code and the lumin@@ osity of the photos in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result . as soon as you are satisfied with the result , you can use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you want to get a photo at bad light conditions , you can increase the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation . all changes you can perform a good choice when him can be seen in the preview . if him also like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple leu@@ ka@@ emia / contrast / Gamma is the tool @-@ value correction for impro@@ ving the exposure to this tool only require the application of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the history below .
the window contains a Grap@@ e of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or of the selected section . among the gr@@ ape are three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked and the top values of the image . the left side is presenting the dark and the right side of the light .
the eas@@ i@@ est way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ ate the controller and then change it as the image changes .
on the right side you can view the original and the preview of the image . the preview will be dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated on the left side are the following options .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box may be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or lo@@ gar@@ ith@@ mic Y axis is displayed . for pictures of a digital camera is dom@@ inated by a constant color . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dom@@ inated in this case .
three knob : the top for dark sounds , the middle for bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones are called gam@@ ma@@ ze .
the three color replacement parts can be used in the preview of the origin@@ als of the original shadow , in order to adjust the input of the shadow , medium and bright sounds . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values can be able to specify the selection manual values for any area . they often have to change the output values like the input ranges . the compression of the output can be used as background as background during anything else during the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this knob , the image values will automatically be set automatically depending on the image values of the image .
save and store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and later again , the Gim@@ p levels are used .
if you want to use this mode and the three color photos will be automatically adjusted for all shadow , funds and sun ones , and click the preview of the Origin@@ ale for Rot@@ - , green , Blue and Lumin@@ esc@@ ence .
the option of over@@ exposed aggregate controls all colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixels , and this is the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , so you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below is an example for the alignment of the input values on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output image has been unchanged ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options available :
Modi@@ fied channel : this selection box allows to connect the channel from the module :
in addition to this box you have two symbols to switch between a linear and lo@@ gar@@ ith@@ mic view . for pictures the most linear mode of the mean@@ ing@@ ful colour produces a wide beam of a wide beam in this case . in this case the lo@@ gar@@ ith@@ mic mode .
for example , if you move to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that this bright sounds with the dark output values and the corresponding pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ ings to see you want to change the right line on the curve , which makes the original value on this line and move this then to the value to your taste .
save and store : with these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve can be stored in the file system and later , the file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format .
if you build this method and add the control points of the curve for all channels of the atten@@ de@@ - and sun ones . activ@@ ate the color video that you want to use and click the original image to put the control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option of over@@ exposed aggregate data will be found to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was correc@@ ted in the lumin@@ ance channel . Sch@@ atten@@ uation and sun ones was set up with the color video . the original image is set at the original image ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; dig@@ m ; image processing is a tool to improve the paint can@@ als or the paint sh@@ ades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can work it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can view the relative distribution and out@@ lay . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as a comparison to the own rider .
the preview of the goal of the target contains a red mark@@ ers . if you see this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the respective color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction , it is particularly convenient if you want to adjust the respective colour components , as the channel mixer then change the tool to the generation of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white port@@ ra@@ its .
sometimes , if you have been Monochrome , the reduction of a color in a visible noise , which looks like a colour can@@ al , which looks like this case . if the case is like this case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion to improve the color .
save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any popular mixer setting , you can store it for later and then load the user file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposed aggregate controls all colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixels , and this is the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , so you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in the Blue channel . the option of Lumin@@ ance is activated . the original image is activated under ( 1 ) and it worked under ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fas@@ cin@@ ating because of your Abst@@ rac@@ tion . with the development of digital photography , black / white , can be converted to the computer with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering with a green lens filters . this looks good , at all scene images and fits particularly well to Port@@ ra@@ its against the sky . so like the 004 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange fil@@ med : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering with an oral g@@ ins@@ en@@ filtr@@ ation . this improves landscapes , -@@ scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ med .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering with a red lens filters . this creates dram@@ atic cut @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ ur@@ is@@ c@@ ised for the daily time . so like the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering with a yellow le@@ gen@@ ic filter . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and so similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Se@@ pi@@ aton : produces warm and medium tones during a bit of cold in the saddle of a pressure and the development in a se@@ pi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and so similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
you can use &amp; dig@@ i on ; tool tex@@ ture you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a tex@@ ture to your picture , regard@@ less whether it can look like a painting on a screen that I can look like a painting portrait or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture tex@@ ture can be used to use the image processing .
relief : sli@@ dable of this parameter increases to the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional design of tex@@ ture .
a paper tex@@ turing is used on the picture below . the original image has been used ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . parameter Relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; dig@@ m ; tool box can add a decorative frame to be added in a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the b@@ orders of a photos is no light task . a possibility to keep its attention to the picture . this is a psych@@ ological Bar@@ rier for sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under the frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set you set the desired type of frame for your image . the picture with a colour@@ ful line , ni@@ ep@@ ce cor@@ b@@ ate it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , ab@@ ru@@ sted it with a nice three @-@ dimensional design and decor@@ ate a decorative frame to the patterns .
width : width of frame in percent . the segment &apos;s width is limited to a width of 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than original , but the same aspect ratio will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have made the tool after the aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can add one @-@ format text in a picture to any position . this is also possible on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive and use it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics . you will select the character set that you need a frame to select the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . the image is ready .
every setting that you have chosen for your text , can be changed to button &quot; OK &quot; after the image once has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed .
you can use the &amp; dig@@ i ; tool st@@ encil to apply a st@@ encil to a picture .
the menu picture st@@ encil to apply in the image processing can be used to put on a picture .
for the st@@ encil there is no restri@@ ctions regarding the size and orientation . you need to add your st@@ encil to the file format list . who want to add your st@@ encil to the file size in English to the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; mail@@ ing list dig@@ ic@@ am @-@ Users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for first time you need to put your st@@ encil printer with the button ord@@ ner in dialogue . select the folder where you have taken the file files to the next start .
after the root can@@ al for the templates put a tree view that refl@@ ects the Ord@@ n@@ erst@@ ru@@ structure of the st@@ encil printer . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increased the picture below . to ensure the mouse leads to the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
ver@@ bs : this knob resi@@ zed below the picture below . if you want to use the position of the mouse . if you want to use the st@@ encil to the whole picture , you &apos;ll need to ver@@ ify the picture to the left mouse button .
move : use this knob to move the st@@ encil image . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the st@@ encil to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; dig@@ i am ; presents three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you have hi@@ ding in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , generated , particularly in dark areas , bas@@ ketball images .
in@@ sight @-@ mask works on the contrast of the edges of a picture . indeed it is no little bit , it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can do it to remove atmosphere . the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , as he really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a little comp@@ lic@@ ated in its application and has different parameters for adap@@ tion .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these measures that the high resolution are exposed to a common color . the same phen@@ om@@ enon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more toler@@ ated than normal cameras for the private users .
in JPEG images it is often used in an internal camera . pictures in raw format , always must always be used during the processing .
some scanner using a sharp@@ ness already during the image of the image . if you de@@ activ@@ ate it , check out the control over your image .
in some situ@@ ations you can easily rec@@ ess results by using a phot@@ ograph with the sharpen@@ ing @-@ factory sharp@@ ness . you can also call the menu entry for the menu entry .
you should go to this , as the results are not exceeding of course , that the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enh@@ ancing any further information on the menu entry to the focus . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too sharp . the solution that looks a little soft to draw . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry correc@@ ted turn@@ out and experim@@ enting with the menu on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove sanding from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview the preview can help the image . this window indicates the issue of the filter with the current settings .
there are two key parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate often good results and should first become an increase of the effect or the amount of the effect . if you generate the in@@ spir@@ acy mask to strong , rob@@ ber@@ ate and impression of gra@@ ves close to sharp edges .
the radius represents a lot of pixel on each side of the filter are affected . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore buy pictures at the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the spo@@ ilt image one of the original , thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a break out of the maximum RGB @-@ value and the difference of the filter . it can be used to use a minimum difference between the fo@@ od@@ ing of the sharpen@@ ing of the sharp@@ ness and therefore sho@@ p@@ urity in mind , heavens and water damage .
this is an example for the extremely bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the original image die ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; dig@@ i on ; tool focus is a picture by impro@@ ving the sharp@@ ness . it used the ur@@ ging @-@ fold filter alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture to &amp; quot ; this is better approach as a sharp@@ ness . it is used to use a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese . it is used to make better results as an extremely sharp mask . you can launch it from the menu by connecting colors reproduction in the image processing .
in practice it works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ender . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ender has a very long tail , which makes the mathemati@@ cal result of the source pixel , which is far not affected by the original pixels , which is quite strongly affected by the pixels . which causes ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most images should set the default value for the use of this module . you can use a higher value if your image is extremely bl@@ ur@@ red , but then your picture should be made on Heilig@@ ensch@@ ein .
cor@@ relation : an increase of cor@@ relation can contri@@ bute to the cor@@ relation . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 to 1 . Br@@ auch@@ able values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation to the cor@@ relation effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the volume filter can help you to reduce the image quality . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the volume filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is quite bad@@ ly . a high value is 0,03 . a high value is measured here .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this is the most common cause you to avoid this value to 0 if you need to use this value to zero , so you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the space filter .
matrix size : this value determ@@ ines the size of the transformation matrix , especially when you have large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß , if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any number of re@@ focus parameters will be stored for later and then you can be loaded .
try all of cutting , color and intensity setting on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture on the background . the reason for this is that much of the changes did not be visible immediately , but the very pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; when JPEG , you should use the module on the un@@ compressed picture .
completely bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ur@@ red result than sharpen@@ ing . this might be caused by means that the bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ender a bigger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically seen bl@@ ur@@ red bl@@ ur@@ ry . even under optimum conditions . even under optimum conditions , it would never show the effect of FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters always at least exactly as good as the in@@ spiration mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters is frequently better than the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ foc@@ used image :
the original un@@ sharp cheddar image has to be correc@@ ted . this image has been done with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ foc@@ used result is attri@@ buted to the Auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods to the sharp@@ ness of digital images you can read a technical data in English under this address .
the controls smo@@ oth@@ s the in@@ spiration of the range of the dark was turned to produce a natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ent enables a adjusted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to adjust the blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool @-@ error correction is one of the most recently developed tool to remove un@@ necessary art@@ ef@@ acts with example .
the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm was developed by the IMAGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter Settings , you can use the Rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a true Gl@@ asses about the picture . the value of 0.9 should be so that no sharp@@ ness is necessary . please note that the detail @-@ compliance is always be subject to compliance .
exc@@ essi@@ bility Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ oth@@ ly even@@ ly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in a direction of smo@@ oth@@ ly . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will generate a high value of the best pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best at a value near 1 .
smo@@ oth@@ ly &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor on all@@ es@@ . p then set these values therefore to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . if it is necessary , the larger is required when it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect . it must be higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : are how often the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm is run . usually , is usually 1 or 2 .
angle between 5 , 90 &#93; : angle depend@@ ant integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ ro@@ pes Alpha . if Alpha is a long time , it should be a long run time . you should make this value so as larger and for your needs accept@@ able .
integral part size &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : full @-@ stri@@ de width in pixels . you should use the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : this option is only low . it dou@@ bles but the duration . we recommend it to specify him .
buttons Save as and store make this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charging it again .
image mist@@ akes is comparable very quickly at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can therefore set the calculation with the button break .
below you can see picture error with small arti@@ facts file . this module will be used on a picture that in Guatemala City with an analog@@ ous film position during the journey caused by a bad film storage while the original image has caused the original image below ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ i am ; Noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses an ur@@ al @-@ based alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image @-@ filters available to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor smo@@ oth@@ s from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ effects of unique pictures from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor speakers of digital cameras , you can read this in the tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bas@@ eline noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the window details and the sub @-@ windows settings can stay at the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the filter per pixel and can be adjusted the picture by the radius and the color in him is smo@@ oth@@ ed and thus certified smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controlled the sharp@@ ness of the filter . if it increases the pixel distance between the filter . if it is high , you &apos;ll need to adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters image details do not receive more and noise or lubric@@ ating .
cann@@ on : does the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is powerful , the frequency response of the filter . if it is too heavy , you can &apos;t like to lose a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings are not affected by the smo@@ othing process by the details pane settings .
Color : controls the color tolerance of the Bil@@ o . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings does not aff@@ ect the smo@@ othing process by the details adjust@@ ments .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark ranges , which typically have faster than to increase , but also the bar@@ bed areas .
atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the phase isolation . this value defin@@ es how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of ligh@@ tening . if it is increased , the edges will appear to occur when he may appear on the edges . it can be smo@@ oth@@ ed to the edges . it can be smo@@ ked and is the recommended method for this .
save under and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have to be saved into the file system and later .
this is an example of what noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) is characteri@@ zed by default settings .
sometimes a painting for your purpose . the solution that is a little soft to draw , is lu@@ cky much easier than a painting to draw and experim@@ enting with the menu entry correc@@ ting the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; dig@@ n@@ am ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most recently developed tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restau@@ ration gives you the possibility to remove your photos of your paintings . it is very well adapted to remove your paintings , film , cry@@ at@@ zer , compression resistance and local error . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image con@@ tours and will receive the contents as well as the human eye .
the same alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm can be used for color and texts . the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm is done with another tool , the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even so far away . as a loss of compression alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm , - small standards the un@@ compressed picture to see the un@@ compressed picture . this setting shall be correc@@ ted these problems .
buttons Save as and store make this . each setting of photo rest@@ ore can be saved in a text file and later again .
photo rest@@ ore is comparable very quickly at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can therefore termin@@ ate the calculation with the button closure .
below is a picture with a equ@@ ally @-@ shaped noise , the module is applied on a black and white photo that you can see the original image of 3200 ISO ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the original image of the original image ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted below ( 2 ) .
below you can see a further example for the photo Rest@@ oration . this time , tex@@ tures was read on an old color photo that caused by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image has been seen under ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ am ; tool Hot@@ inches allows you to remove hot@@ pixels from photos which were made with a CCD camera to remove eight . it uses alg@@ orith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i Project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ lop .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially in high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
please download this file in the st@@ assi@@ st@@ ants with a button dark . the tool is recogni@@ ze the hot and bright pixels . these are high@@ ligh@@ ted in the photo show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark @-@ image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark image to correct image . a automatic processing of the dark @-@ size will notice the bad pixels . please note that the assistant to inv@@ ites you to inv@@ ites this automatically in the next session .
the image range and the preview can help you correct within the image of the result . the fe@@ eds shows the issue of the filter with the current settings . poor pixel are fixed in all single areas .
in order to see the def@@ ects pixels on the preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ating these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ an : it becomes an average of ad@@ jac@@ ent pixel . the resulting color is made all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block , to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pul@@ led to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in a block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixel on a block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ i am ; Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ s , i.e. lower corners , one of the image .
in particular , in particular &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ ti@@ eren@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they often reach the corners and edges of the image by cli@@ cking the light into the light there . tele@@ photo demonstr@@ ates the light into consider@@ ing this behavi@@ or .
but also the draw@@ back@@ s . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which is impossible to keep the necessary camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be possible with center filter , a opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise in@@ si@@ cally safe effects through movement .
with the large plat@@ inum resistance of today , film and gray @-@ scale ranges of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter to sim@@ ulate the transformation of a Cent@@ er@@ filter on a picture . the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm is copyright protected by John Walker .
with three artists , you can control the v@@ ign@@ s @-@ correction filter and with three additional ex@@ termination of the target .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity setting up to the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2,0 , according to an optical filter of 2 , in an optical filter to compens@@ ate a larger degrees of v@@ ign@@ et@@ ting to compens@@ ate a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ marks , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of a picture with the v@@ ign@@ et@@ iz@@ ing correction . you need to adjust the target range of these options . the controller provide you only positive values as you have to increase the settings .
if you want more sensitive new adjustment of the destination of the target ? let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the Gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; dig@@ m ; image processing from the menu colour Gr@@ ad@@ ation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the v@@ ign@@ iting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted image . a Leu@@ ch@@ strength@@ ke@@ - and contrast correction was also done with the image with this tool .
the &amp; dig@@ am ; lens is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos . it uses an ur@@ iting alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tion . coloured di@@ stor@@ tion cannot be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is treated the general geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tion of the lens and the concave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third quarter has a similar round file , but eight to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth tr@@ ades correc@@ ted the corners of the corners . if you combine these two combine any geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tion can be elim@@ inated .
General : this value controls the thickness of the di@@ stor@@ tion of the second degree . with negative values can be correc@@ ted with negative di@@ stor@@ tion and positive values .
corner : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stor@@ tion . this value is stronger than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ ent@@ ils , the &apos; corners has the ver@@ ify sign of the parameter .
Zoom : this value scale the picture size new and leads to a correction of the first degree through neg@@ atives values . Neg@@ ative values enlar@@ ge the image .
brig@@ h@@ ments : this value adjust@@ ing the brightness in the form of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you will help the best filter Settings , illustrated in the dialog with a preview of di@@ stor@@ tion correct . the values can be used for your image , and used in the next start as standard values .
the t@@ onn@@ et or pil@@ low@@ ing correction should be carried out before the cutting or size modi@@ fications . the best result will perform this correction than all the first through . if you make a picture new to cut out the effect of the fal@@ low .
to help you to help the best correction to show this tool . move the mouse button in the picture show to fix the mouse panel in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection you can finish the t@@ onn@@ en- / cold di@@ stor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correc@@ ted a goat di@@ stor@@ tion . you can remove the resulting dimensions of black edges . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu of the image processing or over the zoom of this Di@@ alog@@ s .
for most images the t@@ onn@@ en@@ o@@ idal cor@@ correction . the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings it is the persp@@ ective as to correct the angle in the image 90 degrees . please note that if you have a slight di@@ stor@@ tion of persp@@ ective .
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ et correction on a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produced the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the range for the preview . if you are the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can adjust the file size and film Sens@@ itivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Fü@@ ge tex@@ ture . the ISO controller changes the amount of film pieces and the Domin@@ anz of paint green ( chlo@@ roph@@ y@@ ll in nature ) . green me@@ adows are white like snow !
since the filter size is missing to produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it to apply the effect to black / white photos as the Far@@ bin@@ oc@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ fil@@ ming effect on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the original image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the top lights .
the &amp; dig@@ i am ; filter Film Festival is a simple tool to produce film labels on your paintings like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the movies to produce the manufacturer large silver bas@@ kets of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film bas@@ eline is your photo shows a certain m@@ ood or seems to move into the past . the treated picture gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere . if you want to move this special , gallery ar@@ bit@@ ches , road @-@ phot@@ ographic , bas@@ ketball , bas@@ ics , you need to use this filter .
with the knob the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ arity of the Kör@@ ner can be calibr@@ ated when frequently used higher values , when you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter multiple times .
this is an example of the film bas@@ ketball board on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the specified film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ am ; filter oil paintings created the appearance of a oil paintings . it uses a ur@@ al @-@ based alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ i am ; filter oil painting gives you a nice view like a oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regulator to influence these effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five of . thick@@ er brush are better for large images . smo@@ othing the glass or , from the other side , the Schar@@ eness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is characteri@@ zed by the ( 2 ) . pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixels is 1 and 2 .
the &amp; dig@@ i am ; filter coal use uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carb@@ onic art . pictures whose gra@@ dients are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imag@@ ine yourself . this would be good photos to start it .
there are two control knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing intensity .
the &amp; dig@@ i am ; engraving engraving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was marked in the wax , it uses a copyright alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ am ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where the filter is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the picture in a grey landscape .
the depth allows you to set the contrast of the filtr@@ ation . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art works by di@@ stor@@ tion . it uses well @-@ based protected alg@@ orith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells and can look like whether it is regard@@ ed by glass blocks .
oil blocks 2 : analogue to wave blocks 1 is the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time with the knob .
with this filter group , you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an art works by im@@ aging effects . it uses well @-@ based protected alg@@ orith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Un@@ derst@@ anding : ref@@ err@@ ing the picture along the ec@@ ular lines from a center point . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ om@@ ni@@ an camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al acc@@ id@@ ents : p@@ ens the picture by turning the pixels by a medium @-@ point . this sim@@ ulates the unc@@ ertain@@ ty of an rotating camera .
remov@@ ing bl@@ ur@@ ring : ref@@ used the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focus camera line . the object seems to enter into the background .
movement of motion control : p@@ ens the image by horizontal movement of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the ign@@ or@@ ite of a linear moving note : b : from a car or train photograph@@ ed , camera .
turn@@ out unc@@ ertain@@ ty : swe@@ at the picture soft in the dark and heav@@ ily in light tones . this is ideal for creating romantic port@@ ra@@ its , Gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and sub@@ t@@ elling .
Schütt@@ el@@ aps@@ ody : ref@@ err@@ ing the image by random ver@@ ification of pixels and sim@@ ulates the dis@@ ul@@ ary of a ar@@ bit@@ ches of ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary .
Intelligent Un@@ sch@@ ol@@ ves : take the color spots in the picture and p@@ ushed them to change this without the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and made it , through the fill with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore termin@@ ate this calculation with the button closure .
the RE@@ GEN@@ TRO@@ PF@@ EN are a nice small tool to make RE@@ GEN@@ TRO@@ PF@@ EN on your image . this gives it a great view . it uses a great view . it uses a from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ h@@ eber@@ ge@@ dly protected alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p size it is often necessary to reduce the size of the image growth . Number of drops the number and the density of drops . fishing change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; dig@@ m ; image processing is free of RE@@ GEN@@ TRO@@ PF@@ EN . use the selection -@@ tool for example , e.g. a face that is free to stay free . if you start the filter RE@@ GEN@@ TRO@@ PF@@ EN , the area is free of RE@@ GEN@@ TRO@@ PF@@ EN .
this is an example of RE@@ GEN@@ TRO@@ PF@@ EN Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sun@@ set and the worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sun@@ set after an assault . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture has the false orientation , you can bring it by mir@@ rors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ing Rot@@ ate or Transform@@ ing Spi@@ es .
foto st@@ um@@ bs is definitely one of the most recently developed tools to enlar@@ ge a photo of a minimum loss of image quality .
a painting is simple . the great question is simple . how can you find a picture zo@@ om@@ enon if the limits of the resolution are used ? how can you find the missing information about how can you find a good work ? how can you see here a good work . try it and you will see it .
if a photo has the wrong size you can sc@@ aled it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the target value in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is below .
the tool for the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to adjust the pixels . if you want a small image with better quality . then try the tool to the blow .
many image processing programs are using a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation on the enlar@@ ge of a picture . &amp; dig@@ i ; used a further developed approach . the und@@ erl@@ ying alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool , as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider &apos;s new size and are counted below :
aspect ratio said : if this setting is enabled , if the indication of the new size is set to preser@@ ve the aspect ratio of the original screen .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . if it is necessary , the larger is required when it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect . it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and store will be used as a text file for photo . it can be saved as text file and later again .
foto st@@ ruck is very fast on what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can check the calculation at any time with the knob .
you can see below one example for photo infl@@ ated by cli@@ cking a small @-@ sized image to the double mag . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication compared to comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a common tool for the mouse , you can easily produce a picture with the mouse , to press the mouse button and move the rectangle with the mouse button . they will look at the mouse while they move the mouse .
if you cut the mouse back again , the area of the photos will be cut out . so you can enjoy a good overview as your photo after cutting edges . you can produce the size of the square . a new rectangle by cli@@ cking with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting table , you will use the button panel button in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be trimm@@ ed ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save or file to save the new photo .
in the front area you can change the size of the rectangle by changing the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog .
in tool for the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or horizontal format . in the portrait format , the larger value of height and horizontal format is assigned to width .
the tool after aspect ratio can be used as an aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regard@@ less of it , whether you can see centi@@ meters , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog box you can cut the range for cutting possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation , in dependence on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool for the aspect ratio can be en@@ rolled up from the aspect ratio ( Horizontal or Vertical ) . if you have the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data is refl@@ ect the image and not the original image .
the settings of the compos@@ itions help allow support to help you to have your pictures better . these Hil@@ fen are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic di@@ stor@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third triangles , harmon@@ ic triangles have a possibility to share a rectangle in the diag@@ on@@ als of diag@@ rams .
Golden middle : the golden middle is a pitch that looks the natural growth path like e.g. the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . they de@@ ep@@ ed in all possible d@@ ingen on which we are nice .
the golden pitch is used to use the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you have already used the golden pitch in all times , when you have your paintings , buildings and even photos of your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is the number of Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 equal to the sum of their two numbers . this rule is as visual harmon@@ ic as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden middle represents a liquid relief lines when you want to see a picture . these Hil@@ fen are counted below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will reach your goal good results for your photos . in comparison to the third line , the eye can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river .
another rule are called the shi@@ elds of golden spiral , also called golden spiral . it should be a line to handle the middle of the composition . this can be just like that the eye can easily lead because without the eye , it will ful@@ fill his task .
the Golden triangles are also discussed by the above @-@ discussed gold spiral . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles , no equivalent of the triangles can be arranged at this lines as a static object .
if you want to use Golden triangles make a effect of the professional Phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic Symmetry . try out your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you may not reach differ@@ ently .
options Horizontal mirror and vertical mir@@ rors are used to refl@@ ect the harmon@@ ic participation .
with button Color , you can use the color of the auxiliary lines . if you can use a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be inv@@ isible . on this type you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate any image at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . you can repair this with the &amp; dig@@ i ; image processing and the tool free rot@@ ational . choose Free rotation and adjust@@ ing the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are in degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right @-@ hand side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right above .
to your help , the Module Free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview for the two lines , you can adjust him with a pressure on the left mouse . now , adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a painting , you will find three square holes in the corners . a possibility to repair the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image to cut the function . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing smo@@ oth@@ s the picture a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ imeter transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the centre of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the persp@@ ective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically calculated . on the right side of Di@@ alog@@ es you will find some information which help you want to change the persp@@ ective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty ranges die by the transformation are origin@@ ated in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which origin@@ ated by the transformation are origin@@ ated in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the trans@@ formed areas .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the trans@@ formed areas .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ formed areas .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ formed areas .
after adjust@@ ing the persp@@ ective , the picture shows a little bit . for a single adap@@ t , this effect is small but two adjust@@ ments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have the persp@@ ective , you get a pleas@@ ing tri@@ angular holes to the corners . a possibility to cut out the image with transformation cutting from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can use this module over transform@@ ers .
make your image by turning the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can check horizont@@ ally and ver@@ ify . if you are pres@@ et@@ ting at zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be displayed on the right and the new dimensions of the target area will be shown on the right .
to your help , the mouse will move a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to fix a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the picture , the picture is a bit s@@ me@@ ant . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , but two cas@@ ings produced double so@@ oner and therefore you should avoid this .
according to Sch@@ erung has the image un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to elim@@ inate this image with transformation cutting from the image processing .
&amp; dig@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read formats from your system and , in some cases , from the species such as libraries , you can work a large number of images with &amp; dig@@ i .
based on this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all on their system available formats , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; dig@@ i on ; displays only files in formats to the field . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; dig@@ m ; the file is listed in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions and others . in the section configuration will find further information .
almost all digital cameras are saving photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow it even to use the format . an exec@@ ut@@ able description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ i ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method to digital images . they are redund@@ ant information to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000@@ s version can also store free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want more about the raw image format , you can read by Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful Tut@@ orials in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am . on the section configuration , you can find more information on the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am .
&amp; dig@@ i am ; supports the loading of raw image only supported by the program d@@ c@@ raw , which is contained in &amp; dig@@ i ; the table below shows a short list of raw formats used by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are saved frequently in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format ; but there is no film working program and therefore do not want to work on a film file , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of films to play the program .

the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can &apos;t be described in this hand@@ book , as they are not sold separately from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have to be sold separately . most modules , which can be distributed over the modules itself .
since the modules are used by several applications , it may be used to test the modules with &amp; k@@ c album ; you should try out new modules first using the command &gt; cry@@ pt album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I could not expect it !
the applications that uses the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together , are very different , which means that some modules can work with &amp; k@@ c album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you divi@@ der features with various applications .
the largest difference between &amp; k@@ c album ; and other applications that can also use their pictures in albums . this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates that kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulated for some modules the order , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
thus sim@@ ulates and book album ; the current album that matches the current view , so all the pictures that allows you to look at the picture .
apart from the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums passed away from this page . this will go on &amp; k@@ c album ; as follows :
if &amp; book album ; s brow@@ s@@ ers the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is a album for the module .
or , the category you used in the settings dialog as Category for virtual albums , if you want to use the category persons , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do if you have chosen people to view and module this module .
since some modules are equipped with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can use them from the list of modules . start the dialog for dialog and select the modules , which modules are loaded into the modules .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen , once you &amp; sound album ; start your own pictures .
as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with the window , which you can see the window that you have no more information about your paintings . in the section we will have no information on this window , then click on this window , which displays you a overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any image with notes . there are more information about the people that are shown on the picture where the image has been recorded separately or for a major number of pictures on all images , and all images taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for the search and brow@@ sing , as you can see in the section . if you want to see these notes when you want to use the built @-@ in viewer .
in you can see three lists with a text box by playing people , locations and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always enter information about your images .
following idea is the conclusion of the images within the list step : if you are shown for example a family party and are shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the used can be found on the above , the persons can be found faster and can be found .
if you prefer to select a list of Alphabetical list , click on the icon to sort by the list .
if you have selected notes for any image , you want to work out any selected pictures , and these pictures are equipped with notes . click in this case , simply click on and back @-@ buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu of multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a over@@ throw . in order to show that there is a special symbol , a special symbol will be shown .
in the context menu of the comments , it is possible to add a entry to a existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . please note that this entry was able to make this entry to one sub@@ category . attention , this is ahead , you just see your categories in alphabet@@ ical order .
you can move the individual elements of the comments to form the cor@@ ing that form the upper part of the frame , click here and sli@@ der . you can also move out of a frame also to pull it out outside the window area .
if you are looking for the window of the window that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers the possibility to save the current structure and view of the window .
you can also release a frame as well . if you want to receive this window later , do you want to get the button options ... and here then window a / hide . this step will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in browser , you will select an overview of selected images of the currently selected images , or all images , if you have no filter for example . you can see the size of the fe@@ eds , con@@ figure the mouse with central mouse , . try it simply .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this in the image viewer . if you have no window with a viewer , a new display windows will be created .
you can delete images in the image preview photos . select the appropriate pictures from you want to delete or select either the remov@@ ing button or select the menu click choose . now , you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use this problem for this problem . you can also use to have you saved on the hard disk . you need to record the images from anywhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images from the hard disk .
pictures taken with which the right upper right corner is not stored on the hard disk . this is e.g. for the images 1 @-@ 9 , however , are not possible to see the images 1 @-@ 9 , but you can see the preview of this images . you can also see these pictures not with the image viewer .
how you see you need this function that you want to ask files from the files and again . if you don &apos;t want to ask the recording of the support CD . if you want to avoid doctors , how to store a larger hard disk to store all pictures .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to do the images so that at the end of those who can see you for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can see also all the pictures that can watch your little sister , unless you want to lock .
with that , you have set that images in case of the case should be set up your choice . if you want to have your choice , simply select the men@@ us pictures , which you want to be locked , please read the images again , click on Sp@@ erre .
it is also possible to set a password which have to set out the images to un@@ lock the images . to set this password , choose a password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this image protection is quite safe . you can read this type as an un@@ encry@@ pted text or delete the password as un@@ encry@@ pted text or delete . this type of password protection serves only , den@@ im , which are familiar with &amp; k@@ c album ; not very familiar with the view to the private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your paintings with &amp; k@@ c album ; manage and hours about hours that you want to consider . from this reason &amp; War album ; about one picture _ and video viewer . these can you be described from the preview as described in described above .
the viewer can be seen here . it shows the image , but added any more information about the image , like who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture , you can see this simple with the mouse and what you can see more information . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . that &apos;s the context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box , please click here . if you want to click the browser , see , matching entries to this page . if you are on Anne Helene here , the browser you have selected all images of Anne Helene . if you prefer people from the browser and then Anne Helene was selected .
if you have more images in the viewer , you can switch between them and return the buttons picture high and picture below . you can jump on the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are charged in the viewer . &amp; k@@ ware album ; inv@@ ites you to press the new image to just a few seconds . how often do a new image will receive the Ctr@@ l button and plus or Min@@ us . start and stopped the po@@ inting line by the buttons Ctr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of &amp; spa book album ; is it using the full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer . you can simply move into the image and extract you with the mouse easy to move . with the Min@@ us button , you can easily extract the Plus key zoom in the centre of the picture . displays the result of the ZO@@ OMS .
with the point @-@ button you can with@@ stand your zoom , so the image is not tra@@ iling . with the equ@@ ation paste the ZO@@ OMS , so that each pixel is on the screen of a picture of the image .
NOTE that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work with videos that her@@ ds and extract with the pl@@ us@@ - and min@@ ust@@ ic .
with the rotary functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this works not with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with menu comments from the context menu .
if you are viewing , you can find a picture with one person , whose names do you specify on the image . in the moment you can add the view and configuration dialog for the picture to mark these names . they will draw only the image to mark and more images .
another situation is to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos you can launch the viewer with the pictures and they are as well as good or bad , while you can see one after the other .
for the two examples at the top there are the possibility of feature pictures with features , while you can see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can see the respective letters . in view it &apos;s a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set up your photos , you are available in browser . if you are always selected , if you are always selected , so provided all at once with notes . this is in described here . this is a module to copy the selected images to a CD or what ever you want to do .
categories and particularly characteristics can view at the front view . if you can add categories in d@@ re View view , you can select features to the pictures by changing the letters for the watch@@ word , after the picture was selected here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; to paint album ; on the picture to paint .
the painted old is not saved with the picture but in the database . on the way you can make your paintings later .
in you can see a picture on the painted old . to finish the Painting &apos;s Painting &apos;s Painting menu . in order to finish the Painting menu from the context menu . to finish the mouse button , simply select the cross in the tool@@ bar at the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to rule the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but you should not be read , but the documentation of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should be read , and underst@@ ood them .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects in the object characteristics and displayed the object in the wire model - views yellow .
you can also choose multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of one already selected objects , as all objects are selected with the object .
to add a new object to the object tree , select the position to insert the object in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are possible positions , the following placement menu will select the right position to choose the right position :
remove delete either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed , click to apply these changes to apply these changes , please click here with a f@@ ault description . then you can read the input error and then click on en@@ qui@@ ries or change the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the integration dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L users to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you work a tex@@ ture or part of a tex@@ ture , you can see a preview of the industry image .
press a preview of the scene file and a small example of the scene is selected by the selected tex@@ ture . if you want to r@@ ender a part of tex@@ ture ( for example a tex@@ ture within a tex@@ ture map and not the entire tex@@ ture map ) , cross @-@ loc@@ ally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can change this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for displacement . you can change the shift by pul@@ ls with the mouse in the entire window .
each object model has a visi@@ bility level . you can specify this value relative to visi@@ bility level or as absolute value . objects will only be selected or equal to its visi@@ bility level smaller or equal to the scene stage of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window regulations as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like to connect the standard window or if you don &apos;t want to adjust any other arrangement , you can save multiple shutter register and simply switch between different regulations .
to remove a window above or under a present view , draw the initial to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view is attached to the right or left side of this view , extends over the entire height .
if you want to pass several views over each other , you can move the beginn@@ ings into a different view . you can then change the views over the map sheet at the top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views , which are not included in the main window . to solve the starting point on the top area or click on the small to the left the top arrow in the beginn@@ ings .
to close a view , click the small cross in the beginn@@ ings . to prevent the closing , click the small square between the arrow and cross .
you can add additional Views into the main window . click on the menu click here for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can ver@@ ify them at any position .
the current window view can store your window with view ... down . it will be displayed in which you can save the window by using existing or new name .
if you create a scene , you may be r@@ ender . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for r@@ ender , this program has to be correct installed . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 are not supported .
to r@@ ender the current scene , click the icon of the Symbol &apos;s icon or select the menu entry scene .
a Ren@@ der mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . if you want to return the image and quality of the rend@@ ering . if you want to r@@ ender a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can specify any many Ren@@ der modes in highest quality .
if you click on symbol The Ren@@ der Settings menu in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View Ren@@ der modes ... select the following dialogue :
each Ren@@ der mode has a name . you can enter any name , however , is a name that recogni@@ ze the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the right image size . if you want to return a small area of the image . if you want to return a small area of the image cut and enter the image cutting of the rend@@ ering in the procedure .
in combination of quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this is used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the Ren@@ der @-@ Properties can be found in user &apos;s guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with only one beam of the pixels , there are different errors found . these pictures have no fashion effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not shown if they are not shown in the representation of smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; used a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally see pictures with this feature .
if you want to switch an anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam ever pixels . this technique is called Super @-@ Sam@@ pling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ rec@@ ive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling method ; repe@@ ating the super @-@ sampling point , because each pixel is further down and adap@@ tive because the R@@ ur@@ sion depth is derived from the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a beam of pixel . if the difference between the values should be set to the ad@@ ress of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you are calculated a temperature of 4x4 additional points , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is :
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ G 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the Rek@@ ur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the colours , the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that can be checked individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the dep@@ ths .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect to avoid the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern .
the last setting for quality of the rend@@ ering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refl@@ ect is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this cardboard box you can adjust if the Alpha @-@ channels can be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated stock@@ ings have no object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Cons@@ ole Output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; scene , select the men@@ entry file to import ... and select a file in the dialog box .

the color for the control points . the second colour is used for the display of the selected control points .
the colour &apos;s colour is to view in the camera view and in the window type license .
you can adjust the object @-@ up of the points to the grid @-@ menu screen menu of the wire model @-@ views . you can adjust the grid separately for scre@@ en@@ ings , sc@@ aling and scre@@ en@@ ings .
greater values is a precise wire model and therefore require a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time to the rend@@ ering . for some objects like the ball you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
if you are highly detailed loy@@ alty for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model elements uses further . enlarged proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with excep@@ tions of persp@@ ective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this feature makes a better approach for proj@@ ections , requires more time to the rend@@ ering .
if you are wall in en@@ abling , a wall behind the objects will be cut into a chess pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the bottom , a floor ben@@ ds below the objects . the bottom will be displayed in a chess pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you need to activ@@ ate edge , the non @-@ rec@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the rend@@ ering of the scenes the values for deep and sw@@ ell@@ ency can be set up . precise information about the parameters in the section Ren@@ der modes .
on this site you can change existing an@@ das arran@@ gem@@ ents or new window regulations . in the section window , how to create windows and save .
the combination of standard window systems : shows all available window regulations . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window regulations at the start of the program .
the list of Window register shows all existing window regulations . a new arrangement can add a new arrangement with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window regulations shall be identified by the name . the name must be clearly , and cannot be empty .
list the list below the name shows all views for the selected window regulations . new views can add to the button and remove selected views with button Rem@@ ove .
the new window of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with card slots you will not receive a card card view together with the pre@@ face view and floating position not in the main window , but also creates a separate window .
so , you have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without precise knowledge of the two programs . if you want to create simple scene , among the beginn@@ ings : a ball on one level .
but you should see the following war@@ n@@ ings , see you deci@@ de that you will receive a black screen when you use a 3D program for first time you should note these major rules :
if you don &apos;t set up any camera , no rules for the rend@@ ering will be used as a result as a result .
if you insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture .
if you have been installed all error @-@ free , you see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pres@@ cri@@ ptions :
take a little time to learn the men@@ us and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate performance , what you can expect from this program .
they are often used these men@@ us and symbols , so you should try the men@@ us and symbols and their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this instructions , you first remove all objects from the object to remove all objects from the object . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows the entire scene , which you generate . in particular note that the scene from the view of the camera . this is the scene from the view of the camera . this shows the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree contains now a new entry with the designation camera . if you click here , see the contents of the object diagram , where the various parameters of the camera will be found in the user documentation of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you can find more details .
do not change anything concerning the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera can change the camera into the control system , with which you can change the goal of the camera . click here with the left mouse button on an Kon@@ Tro@@ ll@@ Punkt , and draw him to the desired place .
if you want to use button or En@@ ter , change the wire model @-@ views and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the sight of the camera .
there are many ways to create the scene for the scene . you could easily add a Qu@@ ader ( insertion body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a contro@@ versi@@ al method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; offers a simple way option . you can use an infin@@ ite level as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button to use or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view is now also the level , even at the moment just as a limited level . if you reach the scene , extends the level up to the horiz@@ on .
if you want to view the object @-@ tree , you will see the entry for the bottom . in this case you can see the default options for every new object : sc@@ aling , rotary and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise on the horizontal line , just order to select some of these parameters . choose reference and set the values as follows :
choose the ground to produce its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a little bit .
in both cases , a dialogue is inserted into which you can select first object . please select the name in the object @-@ tree ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button Preview you can see how the Pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of this is only a notebook of black material , because you have to check the form of materials with a click preview . enter the colors for the Pigment . also there are many ways to get now the eas@@ i@@ est .
if you don &apos;t want to see in the preview No color on a sh@@ ades and ball , click on button to use and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you get your picture with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course , you are not able to enter the color list . here are two new attri@@ butes , called Single colour list . choose this entry twice ( you can also do this entry twice ( you can do this entry ) , but the chess boards can only be used only with two colors :
choose the colors in the object @-@ tree in any single colour and change the colors in the object characteristics :
this step should be simply exec@@ ute you , since you have the bas@@ ically active work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the sphere should be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can change the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press En@@ ter or button closure ) , so the ball can be floating with the ground . otherwise the sphere would be silent over the ground , because they have the ground to be shi@@ fted down below the bottom .
of course , the rend@@ ering results now is a wei@@ rd result : how already previously see the ball &apos;s appears like a she@@ ar black material . put it in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now prove a material . like the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as Color :
select first object and change the names for example in ball pig@@ ment . click to the pig@@ ment , select the Single Colour and set the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects when you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click here or press En@@ ter .
the settings spl@@ end@@ less effect and reflection sp@@ reads some good visual effect , perfectly suited for glass or chromed surfaces , even if metal : even more is not selected :
you should now have a good impression you have already learned you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; offers you so much learned you to create simple but beautiful scenes can now be created .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a Ren@@ der method to create a two @-@ dimensional scene from a three @-@ dimensional scene or one model .
if you have a Scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the rend@@ ering of the persp@@ ective of the viewer ( i.e. the camera calcul@@ ates ) by each pixel in the scene . the renovation of the light sources in the scene , and like the atmosph@@ eric effects of the light . so the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imag@@ ine , you can see without any camera , the camera is your eye , with whom you can watch the scene . without a light source you can also see black . ob@@ viously needs any scene that can be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
the common file dialog can select your file . Pov@@ ray files are usually the file extension * .@@ pov or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; created

a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to make a rough surfaces without any Beu@@ le on the surface individually mod@@ eled and without the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a tex@@ ture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zen or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will continue to give them a realistic appearance .
a tex@@ ture map is a possibility to give the surface of a object color on pixel base by application of a image file as a color chart .

you may have any additional multimedia keys so that it work as an &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command . thus make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and shall describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context @-@ brow@@ s@@ ers , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list and sk@@ elet@@ on . an example for the D@@ COP @-@ function break could look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still supports some own command line options .
if you should give you a feedback if the script will not be done because all the required modules can be present if all required modules are available and use the dialog if the user will not run a script .
Beg@@ in , &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ c@@ ue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is . for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { Error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scri@@ pts / templates you will find a lot of Tem@@ plate sc@@ ri@@ p@@ te in many different languages . you can find them as basis for your own scri@@ pts , or you can quickly set the required functions that the writing of Sk@@ ri@@ p@@ ten is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can lead your sk@@ elet@@ on data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the eas@@ i@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be supplied every K@@ DE installation .
most scri@@ pts therefore enable the exec@@ ute of external programs and commands . this way it usually may be called D@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s@@ ends notification to all running scri@@ pts . in this reason , Sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te should be re@@ medi@@ cally re@@ viewed and according to events re@@ act . of course , a script will also be ign@@ ore the events even if there is no use .
con@@ figure shows the scri@@ pts on to show the application dialog . if a script start is started , Amar@@ ok the working folder to the folder where all data are saved .
tr@@ ack@@ n@@ ude change reve@@ als that a new piece is played . the script could now be more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or st@@ ump length ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signal zes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
for Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ s@@ s.@@ at , you need to identify the cli@@ cked menu entry to the selected menu of the play@@ list . to remove the want to remove the cli@@ cked menu item . to remove one entry to remove it d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script and e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; or if the user has stops a script , s@@ ends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to er@@ le@@ able for example , e.g. Au@@ dit data or configuration settings .
the Amar@@ ok sc@@ ri@@ pt administration can also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zi@@ p2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zi@@ p2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can also be optionally available with b@@ zi@@ p2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , that the user can clearly be clearly as Amar@@ ok @-@ script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 is only accept only script packages with the enlargement of the extension al script . from this reason you should use your scri@@ pts packages equal to correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ ut@@ able ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ ut@@ able . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the W@@ iki Sk@@ ri@@ pts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can use the category Amar@@ ok ; scri@@ pts .

the current project . if a project changed and not saved , as@@ ks &amp; k@@ 3b ; according to what happened . you can then select between stor@@ ing and changes . you can also break the closing and the project so open .
includes all open@@ able projects . &amp; k@@ 3b ; it is supposed to ask any stored project , what should be done so as they have been called for any project .
includes all open@@ able projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3b ; for every stored project is asked what should be done so as if you have to read file .
if you call this entry , you can select the files that you can select the same effect when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a CD &apos;s project , the so @-@ added files in the basic version of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog box is the same article on the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3b ; for burning the media . the burning dialog can only be open if the project already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can record many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is this ? -@@ help ( can be reached via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with a active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you &apos;re not used to import files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s not used if this function is not used , so it &apos;s more than help , that you can see the files already using existing files and folders .
this entry appears only for a active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . these function ver@@ ify files from the current project . all other files do not stay in the project . these function are no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imp@@ orted files .
opens the CD Copy Di@@ alogue . this allows you to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn a CD to another player instead of normal copy . you should also do cl@@ oning , if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can &apos;t convert any one DVD to a DVD with the help of the copy @-@ di@@ alog@@ s . also , so also the target medium big enough to be the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to Delete a CD @-@ RW . you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .

this is a previously created DVD image . the dialog as@@ ks you immediately converted to a * .@@ iso file as data source , which are immediately bur@@ ned by pressing the burning button .
a be@@ ware DVD video can be converted to you . this Di@@ alogue window appears to be used again after reading a DVD in the syn@@ agogue , but it contains information about the ex@@ changeable video , coaxial settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the pic@@ kl@@ ed medium . these information are displayed in the syn@@ tax view and include qu@@ alities of the medium , such as size and Title @-@ Length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tools of tools &amp; k@@ 3b ; when an entry is cross@@ ed , the tool@@ bar is visible in the main window .
if this is cross@@ ed , a little tip of the window will be shown on the lower edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3b ; and its activities . if this is not cross@@ ed , is the status strip .
the Ord@@ ner@@ ansicht is an overview of your file and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is indicated . CD / DVD drives also includes a context menu with functions such as media Info , lock and un@@ lock the drive or design of the medium .
the syn@@ op@@ t view is an or out . the contents of the table view makes the diagram and view of files into the project view . the contents is also selected the interface to read audio or video CDs , if one drive can be selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the Ord@@ ner@@ ansicht .
the cop@@ ep@@ est in the project view is one or out . the head view is a nar@@ ro@@ wer section , which has no real function , it looks pretty much more beautiful and separates the project view clear from the remaining views .
this opens a Di@@ alogue window for changing the key regulations for &amp; k@@ 3b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , the key order can be down@@ wards .
this will start the k@@ 3b ; therefore set to burn mathemati@@ cs to burn CDs and DVDs . the system holder are required , so you need to enter the system of the assistant to the system &apos;s system ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3b ; . here you can work general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and fine adjustment of the programme .
&amp; k@@ 3b ; is how many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications can also be equipped with an &amp; D@@ COP , interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ ation .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the function of the task , so is rather your taste and the type of your task , which the den@@ ying programs you will be den@@ ied .
in this chapter ass@@ ume that you can use the command line for d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you need to make sure you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3b ; then start the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; features that all &amp; K@@ DE ; program are painted , supports &amp; k@@ 3b ; mainly two more parts , the below are described above .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; k@@ 3b ; features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ad cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) vo@@ id form@@ at@@ D@@ vd ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can generate a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then create a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) vo@@ id add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String par@@ ent ) vo@@ id ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String par@@ ent ) vo@@ id ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) vo@@ id set@@ Full ID ( Q@@ String )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script will create a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / Bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3b K@@ 3@@ b@@ ati@@ cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is a audio CD ; -@@ excep@@ tions for &amp; K@@ DE ; with him can be read , and can be read in MP3 or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the machine is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia ( for the read of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and of many coding ( compressed @-@ free compression ) are not supported by the Linux distribution . other coding can be added ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the Title of &amp; CD ; read and read in WAV files on the computer ( lost and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step this WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or even in other formats like the loss free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the read of &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . almost every distribution has been compiled ; if this is not installed , this is now done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ upto ( for OGG ) or other coding installed . all these programs are already installed there , but only the coding pack@@ ets are not installed , but if such as FLA@@ C is not used , it is not necessary .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher code is a small introduction of co@@ incidence , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to cop@@ ying audio CD ; s : as already said , Us@@ ed &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia to protect the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not possible to avoid any cop@@ ying protection ; even the mechan@@ is@@ ms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of cop@@ ying audio CD ; s !
while import@@ ing only once you have to be called ( the application dialog can be called to read a &amp; CD ; this leads you to the hard disk . this leads ( ho@@ pe@@ fully ) for the slim side of the user interface , which you will find on the beginning frequently frequently .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can complete without network , wher@@ eby everything is manually adjustable .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main master . on the page step for step example , as well as screen shots can be used as well as screen shots descri@@ ptions of the program list .
starts the CD@@ DB in@@ quiry on the CD @-@ data subject to the Device of CD@@ DB . ( this can be loc@@ ally or online ) , in the latter case you must first made the connection to the Internet .
starts the reading and if a encoder in the register option was con@@ figure the coding guidelines - the coding guidelines .
opens a sub menu with a list of available encoder that can be read with any other encoder than the default option . it is to be aware that previously the encoder is configured for registration settings in the application dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a dec@@ ode file is selected for encod@@ ing , instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and enc@@ ode .
opens the invitation to con@@ figure the types of notification ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program files ( such as read &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with various card cards ( such as encoder , to set the encod@@ ers ) . it is to be successful before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ effici@@ ents and compression rates and helps you make the right code of the right code .
if no audio files are lost , a lost audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which are perhaps for these distribution . the dis@@ advantages are ro@@ asted and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , which you lose information by data compression depending on their p@@ sy@@ cho@@ acoustic model , are MP3 and OGG the most common bit rates at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 kbps ) , but beyond this bit rate , the differences are less important when both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ NOT so &apos; free , l@@ ame is free with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality in lower bit rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music is also belongs to other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ preset medium &apos; = This setting gives good transpar@@ ency for most people and most of music
&apos; --@@ preset standard &apos; = This setting is usually sufficient for most people and most music @-@ accept@@ able transpar@@ ency , and has already high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ preset extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kbps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kbps , for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ preset extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 kbps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs some older devices for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need CBR@@ B . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kbps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kbps for all pieces of young people , portable devices and Auto@@ ster@@ e@@ o@@ plants . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ preset ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kbps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you do not necess@@ arily the absolutely highest quality , without the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , enter manual or by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available as a list of parameters . you can be delivered with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the coding program to create the file and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with coaxial systems there is often a combination of program Settings for the coding and this parameter here . the manual or the help to the coding guidelines are the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; Title to the key@@ words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s must be encod@@ ed with l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is available : a free database , in which the audio CDs can be read , so that all other information can be read in the computer , please note that there is only from text files : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I am not law@@ yer . however , no man cannot be att@@ or@@ ney . however , the information is not law@@ ful for the &amp; CD ; more or less wor@@ los , so there is neither the artist nor the music company damage . all information can be done by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ e .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is active in the system used ( S@@ end of an address ) . this type of configuration can be used in this type of configuration , the email address is not used ( This can only be used only the program@@ mer that has re@@ viewed the code . )
there are in many countries of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is used for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the geograph@@ ically on the next mirror server will be used . this saves a bandwidth in the network and the load between the computers .
a visit to Fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for online @-@ demand from &amp; CD ; or during the reading of a &amp; CD ; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( normally a rule monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what a read@@ able program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ our that it is used to know , search@@ ing for the source code .... This was already the best choice for the read of audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia package from the matching distribution first must be installed if this is not yet .
for stor@@ ing the WAV files can be chosen to select the desired file format for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) . other coding can be added to this register .
the code package must be installed from the support Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ fication is required . this is also required for the pre@@ defined coding . more information on co@@ di@@ erer in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a co@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information can be obtained via the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have a lot of causes . check the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and read on your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try , both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might be a note what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not be done !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you want to use other settings , this tips do not need to pass .
if you have read the complete manual , everything underst@@ ood , but there are no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will need enough information about those areas to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we start the program for the first time , everything set up and our first &amp; CD ; we will see l@@ ame &apos; --@@ preset extreme &apos; using a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kbps , on average and ID@@ 3@@ v1 key@@ words ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available for example with a search engine , as it is not fully free software . any@@ way , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files . any@@ way , what you may always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg . by using the con@@ quer@@ or slightly inside ) .
the first section tre@@ ats the basic influence of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something that is probably only once done .
the second part describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for any time &amp; CD ;
here we find our encod@@ ing code for comp@@ ress of music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ preset extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kbps ) , we would like to use the program using the fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change this settings , we will not change it very likely to read more &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device drawing is handed over to the read@@ able program to read it &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbo@@ lic link on the real device drawing . if this is not working or a CD ; / DVD drive system can also be access@@ ed to the file / etc / f@@ stab in and an att@@ empt to connect the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map of the general settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts are not much to do . here you can see an additional conversion . in our example , everything will be displayed as shown in screen photo .
only for the complete information please select that you will be informed if your data is missing ( Tags ) .
the card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the internet by a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
NOTE : the calcul@@ ator has to be connected while reading &amp; CD ; with the Internet access , he may access to the fre@@ ed@@ b Server .
the second selection field is simple , is a &amp; CD ; entry starts immediately , if you have been very satisfied with the database entry and the result will be easily changed with the database entry and the filename , and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter the selection Fields and fre@@ ed@@ b , if you can download the database , however , if you can download the database before . however , this is the database above . however , if you have selected the database , however , the two selection fields is selected , at least the first one of the mode will be set at the following card card .
CD@@ DB is available for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data on request ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b servers on the Internet . like white the system that will be the CD ? Read the passage about fre@@ ed@@ b . place everything so , as shown in screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look according to a mirror server in your vicinity . this road turns the load between the computers . this setting will not work as the first test .
both function does not work on the server , but there are many Fire@@ place the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe even more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to sur@@ d .
in this example , we want to pass any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b Server . the first check box should be disabled .
take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is present on your computer )
Number of simultaneously de@@ vot@@ ive pieces : Un@@ derst@@ anding , there is a reason why do more than one at the same time with only a existing drive ? rip reading and coding ? the author knows it not , so simple himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross it to design this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : if you need this en@@ abling , then it can be useful if only place on any other drive . this can &apos;t be displayed on the private folder where you do not want the files in private folder where you want to do something with WAV files .
all so , as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circum@@ st@@ ances to see anything at all .
&apos; --@@ preset extreme &apos; defin@@ es the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s , such as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . this is a good balance factor is 6.3 . this is a good equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um between audio quality and storage usage .
NOTE the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the restri@@ ction of the generation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent value for the name of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables in the name of the procedure ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
Number of simultaneously to coded WAV files : with an Dual Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to enc@@ ode more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; completed . this configuration will be used as standard for any evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have voted the organi@@ z@@ ational structure of your music , you need them to change again .
in this section the process is described in this section as described as the process of the presentation of the &amp; CD ; we will be installed in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the CD ; dates back to the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process of this section is necessary to be repeated for any time &amp; CD .
since we are using a &amp; CD ; you &apos;re not able to see the screen shots a little differ@@ ently than the for a &amp; CD ; with successfully by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of them from the Internet . Comments to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not happen , the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length can be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; be identified as audio CD ; identi@@ fies and by c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia .
if this is not done , then you are looking for questions and answers to the help or enter back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully passed by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces have already been filled and also displayed the name of the artist and the album .
for the case that it is more than a entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives you a window in the database and you can select the database entry at the best to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t select the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; you can also selected manually from the choice of the first Kn@@ op@@ fs in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
E 1.2 St@@ ep@@ 02 : the CD editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the item in the first line of the &apos; actuator title &apos; , the rest of data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; actuator title &apos; , unless you have a comp@@ ilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower Comm@@ entary box can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ oc@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album will be used for comments on all pieces of CD .
attention : after successful re@@ tri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty , but it already contains the data like in the following screen photo , but it &apos;s not just like to check the content of the CD &apos;s name ( e.g. whether all words with grand@@ parents are or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any additional notes .
NOTE : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ Tags . this is limited , length of the fields on 30 characters for the letter , album , and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment . if you need ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . this option is set up on the subject area set ; take a look at the registration option . take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags .
Tags : not supported by all co@@ atings or file formats . see in help to obtain more information to obtain more information .
simply select a entry that ob@@ viously did not be important with the style of the dis@@ per@@ ture CD ; this example is this not important that we would like to find the information on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example to find Rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &quot; you return back to the main window . click on the line with the second one .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will be back and you see that the fields for the album already revealed with the given data , which we have listed for the first item . the title of the item is one . the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process to enter the same way up to all the title of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not if you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories as the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . NOTE that the artists and the album will be displayed on the list .
NOTE that there is a check @-@ in before each line . a simple click on the line turns out a or out . make sure your pieces are selected or , please select the button in the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces onto a time .
was launched by cli@@ cking on button selection out of the read@@ out process , this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the lectures and tr@@ ace what process .
click on the Rider on the order window . it is on the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of tool@@ bar .
this is the window for monitoring the orders . the first item is read only on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown at the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer that you have not installed there . pieces that were not successfully installed with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list .
by the way , the file for the TM@@ P file and the objectives are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked the file to the folder for temporary files and the objectives ? ; - )
now it is clear that the error occurred right after the end of the first item occurred .
the job 1 reads the first piece of which is finished . but we have completed a new entry : job 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , please read the status of the window , it is now improved .
the author of program has no configuration settings found to read this behavi@@ or , is the result of parallel to read and coding . the used computer is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to date and enc@@ ode ( of however two different pieces ) .

this section is based on people who compiled by the source files , and not for users who use a comp@@ lic@@ ated package of their distribution .
if you are looking for using your needs , if it runs once , it &apos;s the following correctly for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example . it shows screen shots of different card cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , always read on it ? even if only the help menu after the first time of the program , without any reason how it is going to proceed out of such as an empty screen ( especially when it is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or the un@@ usually short menu from ?
what is it ? who reads that this program has already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is a first version for a manual too &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; thought . at least only after the contact recording with the author . and if you read this section , he started this section with this proposal .
st@@ range if it is possible to pick you the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N you don &apos;t need to do this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ pi@@ eler by &amp; K@@ DE ; . besides other has he also have some characteristics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time texts of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support : &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultra@@ Sound @-@ Proj@@ ector , which is supported for G@@ SA cards . AL@@ SA is supported as soon as it supports a sequences .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the ly@@ rics on the screen with changing color , so it is simple to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by flo@@ od@@ ing the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; tap@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( light results or texts products ) . K@@ Mid has automatically used the procedure .
sitting support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; off the play@@ ful of a song , k@@ Mid starts at the same time again with the same song .
supports external MIDI synth@@ esizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US @-@ cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
you can open a Open ... from the menu click here . it appears to select the usual file dialog when you can select the desired song .
you can also use a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window , this works also with multiple songs simultaneously .
to open a music part , open it and press the button closure to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu or as a press the vac@@ ant button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you move it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played a row . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece play , you can use a favorite place by cli@@ cking the middle mouse button and continue with the knob .
if you will find that a song can be played quickly or to slow down , you can change the arrows to the arrows and turn right . to receive the original p@@ ace , double click on the Tem@@ por@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button break as a pressure on the button or select the menu on the button , so the reproduction . please enter the vac@@ ant while no piece is played , k@@ mid &amp; k@@ mid ; play it .
ly@@ rics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use ly@@ rics , other use ly@@ rics and another both . some pieces have not a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust the events which will be used to adjust that a song , so that you might need nothing to adjust the entry automatic text selection , but you have to change the option to change that if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to adjust an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of texts or lists the same function , also keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you want to summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are the series after being played . in this section , how you can use coll@@ ections .
to open a collection , open first the collection manager . this will find you in the menu collection under the point organ@@ ise .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by cli@@ cking on cop@@ ying and then click the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the use of the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
during the application of application , these collection will not stored this collection when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager to add a song . it appears to add a song . it appears to select the file dialog which can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automation to the collection .
when automatic add @-@ adding to the collection , a piece during opening ( using the file or drag &amp; drop ) will be added automatically to the active collection .
when Auto is not enabled to activ@@ ate the temporary collection , the temporary collection is activated and worked together . this collection will be added to the open@@ able pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to select the collection manager that select the collection and the desired song and then click here .
you can select the order to select songs in the songs . if you select the series after the menu from the men@@ us coll@@ ections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove songs or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke Text .
to jump a song , select the button Next song , please press the next song or press the button to the right .
in order to ski@@ p a song , select the button one button , the entry one piece from the menu or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete the collection and click on button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . it doesn &apos;t matter if they are not saved while fer@@ ment &amp; k@@ mid ; don &apos;t be saved .
this is necess@@ arily necessary for Synth@@ esizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events in events which is synth@@ esizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in the events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and is always a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US @-@ Cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there is no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to work the appropriate file from hand ( with your favour@@ ite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that you need all required connection for the playback of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which is so often as desired . for this is , however , that each shows a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END OF KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... END OF KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A more Key@@ map &quot; ... END define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END
you see that it is used to show that a section starts ( except for Options ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , that I offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard are depic@@ ted . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ig@@ no@@ red . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches usually occur in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to insert the sound with the number M ( e.g. GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which allows you to use one drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can write the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
if now , a MIDI file would play a note with patch 127 ( p@@ unc@@ le file ) , it takes you patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the clay 60 , regard@@ less of which , which is sound in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept drum patch included ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that is the sound level of the sound level of the same drum ( like him some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify as sounds like a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
like at PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , and their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define up for each channel and every instrument several Ke@@ ym@@ aps . you must only use several names in the first line .
Ke@@ ym@@ aps are mainly used to prevent sh@@ ades on the Perk@@ us@@ sions @-@ Channel . check out as the delivered Ke@@ ym@@ aps .
this section can be used to specify some channels to others . if you want to try the first and the second channel , make it the very simple in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have a percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , according to the following pattern :
N is the channel that is shown on the Channel . if you want to use Key@@ map with the name name for this channel . if you want to change the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ig@@ no@@ red to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to use the per@@ sions patch on the Perk@@ us@@ sions patch on the Perk@@ us@@ sions patch .
the value for pit@@ ching ratio can be multiplied , in which a MIDI file will be converted using the value n , this is converted with the value of n * ( r / 4096 ) and then it will only be re@@ directed to the value 4096 , so that in the map file there is no decimal comm@@ as .
this setting is used because GM is used to play a keyboard , the value 4096 , a sound higher play . unfortunately , but unfortunately some key@@ boards will play up to play up to a oct@@ ave . to play the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , you can open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you can see the sounds just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have a instrument , if you have changed an instrument , you don &apos;t want to display button no more green but red to show that no more original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to show the mir@@ acles with the mir@@ rors . view in the menu settings under the point of channel view : settings
the p@@ ace @-@ LCD shows the speed to play with a song . each higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tem@@ po of a song . if you like to find a song , you can change it to change the text , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about it , like a music piece , it contains the sheet music , the speed , &amp; etc ; so that it may lead the same MIDI file to very different results , as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I may not need to use none . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a good synth@@ esizer , you can change a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the different instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over all .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ aries ( rpm , de@@ w ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; so it happens , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE @-@ Support comp@@ ile you need to download a source change and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a full folder to a collection , but I have no w@@ ust to add all files individually .
one underst@@ ood , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder where you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files from , and draw them on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
activ@@ ate before necess@@ arily the collection to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can select the arrow shaft to the left from the Tem@@ por@@ - LCD , to play the reproduction . to recover the default tem@@ po you can click the LCD double .
I used on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this mode I would like to play a file if the collection is to play , just into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window change and select the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file , without added to a collection , use the setting automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection
let &apos;s take you to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ es , you will only play the first file to play the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection , then this is precisely this a MIDI file .
then do you deci@@ de to create B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and a collection with all three files . how do you make it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards collected . all thanks ! if I hear these songs or the postcard see , animated me this , further on &amp; k@@ mid ;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ros@@ a.@@ J@@ im@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I have tried to take a little time for my hob@@ bi@@ es , but I try to take a bit time for my hob@@ bi@@ es , but I try to do a bit of programming , MIDI files , music do and ph@@ r@@ ases .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , a mist@@ ake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to be happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you do not make a huge part of your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I would like to contact a MIDI file , but you would like to contact me with me , because I may have the file perhaps already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; it was written in my leisure and by no one I would like to make money . I would like to program because when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ ma@@ ils ) .
Tak@@ ash@@ i I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the abs@@ ence of abs@@ ence that the pitch of A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z , for testing of the G@@ US support , has Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Gr@@ itsch , Magnus Pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Cor@@ niche , Peter Cor@@ des and every one that sent me a patch , a f@@ ault ad@@ jac@@ ent or even a supported e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians in the network which give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage can be found on h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ fr@@ ac@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can see detailed information and images . you will find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you to use a good sound card or an external synth@@ esizer , because the sound quality is considerably from your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you need &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it is then if you have a sound card that you cannot listen to any music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing lists or send a f@@ ault ad@@ jac@@ ent directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program will be used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , and playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; user mail@@ ing list .
the application window will be made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if information in it .
it is possible to use the preferred connections under the menu Book@@ mark , but these are individual entries if you want to play a list of entries , so you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups of groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ies . if you have a entry of anc@@ tu@@ als , will copy his group and all his sub@@ groups to the current category and playback starts with the attached record .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed through the editing of XML configuration files . it can also be changed by a editor , but also through the application . this is easy to choose from the menu click here and as next processing mode . through the cli@@ ffs of a sub@@ group will be displayed only the XML content of this tea .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu of the same with play@@ list and either the processing mode , or another category will be selected .
all changes are lost when the processing mode left or another group will be selected without a play@@ list .
some functions of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during st@@ arten and berries can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activ@@ ate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation must not be short brief@@ ly , it will automatically termin@@ ated automatically through the opening of another source . this would be even if the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the displays of a favour@@ ite photos ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; are the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL formats of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to configuration of my player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the mean@@ time size of data log@@ ged from the network and other things .
another tool for the fail@@ ure is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this play@@ list dialog for this play@@ list of the file dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured through m@@ im@@ et@@ y@@ pe . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played in &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played using the special field for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be used as service provi@@ ders for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in an application dialog for the regulations from K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a con@@ sol@@ es on the charging of the browser module . if no error occur , is the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in this way , a preset back@@ end for a certain mot@@ ime type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on all og@@ g files will be removed :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be done by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . can be configured to the used device and the TV channels , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog should be detected in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . it should be found out of which one can be selected . it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video can also work ( maybe this kind of the play@@ ful of video equipment is also supported ) . this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server need to be functional in his configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
intern@@ ally are used by KM@@ player for sources different names . at the time of this documentation , these dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , source , source , pip@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , start playing the play@@ list .
are there hin@@ ts like I can rip my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not by the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is known as user root after the integration of the device . it is necess@@ arily safe to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine k@@ icks off only slowly , why do my CPU have to be tested for each time ?
NOTE : the answer is over@@ do@@ .@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically use the last stored value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU .

to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should learn the manual at K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with the read of the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
for lat@@ r &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct location : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . this is difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; Latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros is also a less demanding but realistic car that it is from the desc@@ endants of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
there is only a good pleasure to &amp; Latex ; it &apos;s not the ultimate book . b . H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Latex ; : document D@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the same as other not@@ ation languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with the most common features such as paper format , side @-@ numbers and text gr@@ Ã per begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Document } and has to be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { Document } .
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a perfect function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assi@@ st@@ ants ( men@@ us ) provides some of the document . it can also be taken some on the document .
document classes : this is defined by the number of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; brochure &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; leaflet &#93; or custom .
coding : this is set to set the character set of system . modern systems use incre@@ as@@ ingly the UTF @-@ 8 encod@@ ing as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list included the most common additional packages for &amp; Latex ; . for the integration can only be reduced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : docum@@ ent@@ aries of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( maintenance of German DIN @-@ rules ) . you should always find use with the German text .
new users can now be wor@@ ry . it is only a short description of the functions and further information in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - the same as other source code ed@@ itors - the dis@@ predic@@ tion of the used commands , it is possible to see that any mathemati@@ cal environment is not closed . they will be notic@@ ed by the mod@@ est appearance of the output file . however , it is not notic@@ ed by the dec@@ eler@@ ation time , but will save you through the em@@ ph@@ asis time and Ã - r@@ ger .
with the automatic installation of the environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile , automatically generated an empty line ( e.g. \ \ ) { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated by default settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; perm@@ its the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the lowest element ) :
at the view of the document in the structural view , the individual items can be changed by a mouse click on the appropriate .
when creating the own &amp; Latex ; -@@ files can be useful for the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex . as soon as a DVI , -@@ file &#91; straight @-@ independent File ) &#93; is created , jum@@ ps &amp; k@@ ile ; caused by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewing the appropriate line in &amp; Latex ; source code .
a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and other information like the font format of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; . there are many tools to view , transformation and to print by DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and straight .
when using the pick @-@ up , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked to the product code in &amp; Latex ; -@@ source code sp@@ see is the exact part of it . once on an section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ Bet@@ ra@@ viewer .
Master @-@ document : this function is used to work with several files . using one master document the work with other one @-@ related .@@ tex -@@ files simpli@@ fies an project @-@ wide master document on project project settings .
Quick Construction : the &amp; Latex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless error in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the fre@@ eh@@ ed@@ â ¬ â ¬ and it is no call from &amp; eye@@ piece ; after fast construction .
for consider@@ ation of the processing -@@ tool bar , the three large selection criteria are developed for the quick charger in the document . the first selection box is suitable for the fast break@@ down of documents in parts , chapters , chapters , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection table for further information is as subject of articles such as key@@ words , fu@@ els , or wise . ver@@ ification for members are :
name : with this command a name for one section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection box possible ) .
when using quote from quote is displayed with liter@@ ary entries . for &amp; bib@@ tex ; files are appropriate ed@@ itors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; quot tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . &amp; bib@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand written .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¬ will be used for the definition of the font boots for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã - notes etc . there are the following characters :
at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection criteria for creating a new document by sel@@ ecting the document and definition of the settings . 2 . the document can be written on the hand .
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font boots up to the beginning , this may also be done in the text .
as soon as the ob@@ tain@@ ous Source text example , the &amp; Latex ; -@@ source code has to be compiled . the eas@@ i@@ est way to this is the use of men@@ us construction or the Kn@@ op@@ fs .
the source text must be saved before the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile , the storage is automatically automatically .
SCH@@ L@@ Ã ¤ gt the comp@@ ile of the document f@@ ails , should be search@@ ing for the error . when using quick construction should be started &amp; eye@@ piece ; this is not the case , should also be aware that the protocol should be considered .
a environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text which is different as the rest document . for example , a report by the font is being created and only a few acidity . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ \ and \ \ end { environment } , the Ã - n@@ aked of the fon@@ ts in the surrounding area â Be@@ Free ! Be@@ Free &quot; ( english ) .
the extr@@ usion changes will only be taken within the environment ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { I0@@ } to \ \ &apos; { I0@@ } ) . there is no compl@@ aint ( number ) for members within a environment .
there are many thanks to the reading and user friend@@ liness of the document . it can be found certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ si@@ v@@ ure , sub@@ m@@ issions , etc . these commands are either through the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surrounding area .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ si@@ v@@ ure and is such as G@@ Ã ¼ l@@ tig , until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word can be displayed in a set with \ \ em@@ h { word } cur@@ si@@ v .
\ \ quote : created a quote from the document . quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background in writing of the source texts with the &amp; Latex ; -@@ label statement is now follows a step @-@ for @-@ step guide on the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
as soon as the assistant to the assistant , a few adjust@@ ments for the better performance of the document might be used . these quotes a quote , some places in the fat and cur@@ si@@ v@@ ure and a po@@ em to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed using Editor @-@ View or Ctr@@ l E back to the editor ( when the internal viewer ) must be closed on the internal viewer .
as soon as the DVI / file format was created , the document can be converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file would be converted and fun .
DVI ; is a possible file format ( English , D e V ice I n@@ independent ) . these files are made by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers like the .@@ dv@@ i -@@ issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF - conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; -@@ file the same steps as for the creation of the document can be printed on the cli@@ cking on the 7th step - and can be printed on the cli@@ cking device ( if the printer is set correctly ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar fe@@ els the conversion of the DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file made out of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion in recovered other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre@@ h@@ ts@@ ating search for direct jump from the editor to the product information within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; Latex ; -B@@ in@@ Ã ¤ r@@ files . this must only be used more modern music tracks using K@@ ile ... Tools Glue .
to teach the mouse button , the mouse po@@ inter must be positi@@ oned in a row of the source tex@@ ture and se@@ emed to be cli@@ cked on pre @-@ looking for the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ Bet@@ ra@@ viewer .
with this function in &amp; eye@@ piece ; is defined by a click of the Middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; document can be specified in &amp; eye@@ piece ; as text editor ( settings set eye@@ piece ... Editor )
should the use of quick @-@ re@@ build &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewing cannot be an error . should be an error , this is shown in the log file or in the news window .
the log file is to be the error source in the source code . in the Editor , the error file will always be used to consider the error in the error . to specify the f@@ aul@@ ty line . to be cli@@ cked to the error in the log@@ ging and &amp; k@@ ile : jump to f@@ aul@@ ty line .
as soon as on the appropriate button , the tool@@ bar will be able to select a window for the select template for the document . the default user can be set :
when sel@@ ecting a document , document can be written either from the reason to re@@ written or assistant to the fast creation of a new document . further information are included in the section .
user parameters of &amp; Latex ; use usually the same introduction for almost all documents . templates available in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to fac@@ ilit@@ ate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either a existing &amp; tex ; - / Latex ; -@@ file would be created or create a new template using an existing document and selection of the template &apos;s document ...
when creating a new document as a template using the file , some drawing chains are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character set ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings can be set up .
when creating the own template , it is necessary to know what kind of variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input category . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the eas@@ i@@ est way to imag@@ ine a template is the use of the assi@@ st@@ ants and that this way is published in the editor . as soon as the document created the following steps :
when creating a new document , the own template instead of standardized standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; Latex ; -@@ files created a simple way to create a template , should search@@ ed for one in the Internet and described the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bib@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be used directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be taken out .
in order to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his mouth should be taken to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can start there directly with the read of the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start now .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical and lat@@ ex ; command line that can be called for the La@@ Te@@ X Reference &apos; command , which can be used for nearly all commands that can find in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l button , to choose the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to choose between \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when reading the text , mouse button is cop@@ ied to cli@@ cking the cli@@ cking text automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , with push back switch button , possible parts of the source texts in the ed@@ itors window .
&amp; k@@ ile : has the differences of different types of source issues and these emerg@@ ing . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are raised by another color .
many assi@@ st@@ ants dec@@ ent explo@@ sions are concern@@ ed . this is a very own kind of book@@ marks or last jum@@ ps , or the corresponding key stamp . this is also the jum@@ per stamp , so that they will be automatically changed at the first input of a character .
the work is probably one of the major asp@@ ir@@ ation of the program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; K@@ ate ; already outstanding functions for the writing of a &amp; Latex ; -@@ source tex@@ ture . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . amongst others are the following commands to choose text selection :
based on both sides ( group of lines , which contain on both sides a blank line ) . this expanded meaning that tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source texts . the only significant thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the extension are separated by two empty lines .
however , the word below the current Curs@@ or position . this selection has also a extended meaning that this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to explore a part of the document may be nat@@ al . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the entire line away . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the entire line away . &amp; k@@ ile , offers the following commands to get a faster storage . among others are the following commands to read the text :
remov@@ es a complete section . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of evidence .
it has already been demonstrated that environments is a central role in &amp; Latex ; . therefore , &amp; k@@ ile : for more commands under be@@ ats environment for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
with this command you will be det@@ ect to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the present position is ) . the c@@ urs@@ or will be placed directly before the command to the place of the environment .
with this command you will be det@@ ect at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ urs@@ or will be placed directly behind the command .
if you have c@@ urs@@ or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is det@@ ained at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
in the input of many administr@@ ated environments you can go quickly the Ã - ber@@ y change . this command se@@ ated the last environment , so that the sc@@ atter@@ ed environment is not closed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are identified by cl@@ amps { ... } . under ass@@ ist Tex @-@ Group are a few important commands that are made of berries .
with this command you can det@@ ect at the beginning of the actual group ( no matter where the present position is ) . the c@@ urs@@ or will be placed directly before the th@@ urs@@ ing cl@@ amps .
this command is det@@ on@@ ated at the end of the actual group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ urs@@ or will be placed directly behind the glu@@ ed cl@@ amps .
if it is c@@ urs@@ or before or behind the wall clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # 12 , the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
in the input of many s@@ laugh@@ tered groups @-@ stap@@ les can be lost as fast the rest group . this command se@@ ated the last group that the sc@@ atter@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups cannot be closed .
in &amp; Latex ; there are two simple beginn@@ ings as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ fÃ ¼ r used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character &quot; for two simple beginn@@ ings will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character &quot; for two simple beginn@@ ings will be used .
this automatic set of double levels can be set up in settings by using K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X .
there can also be used also L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ french or french ) and thus German or French . there are also many more languages available .
when Shift is controlled by Shift ; En@@ ter , an intelligent line break . if you set the current position within a li@@ est environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , but not only one line break but also the command \ \ item .
the current line with \ \ \ \ \ have covered the current line with \ \ \ \ with a se@@ dim@@ entation round line .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to be preset &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . this can be found in settings , set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users found the columns in tables and thus all Et signs ( amp ; ) sets apart . if this tab@@ ulator is not trying to reach &amp; k@@ ile ; according to the n@@ ude tab . although this tab is not possible to add or c@@ ile ; some inter@@ iors for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already provides a good source code , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex . ) are still extended . these modes can be expanded as required . all these modes can be set for automatic down@@ wards . all these modes can be set up for different working modes ...
at the beginning of a new environment by the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } is automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
on the back , the last character of the input will be removed and possible . on the list , the list may also be different letters by input of an additional letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , can be inserted between &amp; k@@ ile ; also explosive brands will be inserted . alternatively , so a simple jump to these positions are possible and can be found .
under settings of settings ; set @-@ up settings for this lists . it can be used for this lists . it can be used for this lists . it can be used for this lists of general language classes as well as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ cher of general language used .
the command mode is suitable for the dou@@ bling of environments . it &apos;s not a large list with \ \ welcome and the call will be used as often used . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often used , that &amp; k@@ ile : a special mode for the compensation of the environments is required .
during the call for the process mode , the order to be fully operational environment or the key button , the command to be determined automatically and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . there@@ after the ambient conditions can be set off and through wires the input button will be completed .
after this is fully covered , the environment will be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile : recogni@@ ze that it is a light conditions , it is still a first \ \ item @-@ command with inserted .
under settings of settings ; set @-@ up settings for this lists . this mode uses the general list of end@@ urance mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; und@@ erg@@ one defined lists of Ab@@ k@@ Ã ¼ r@@ z@@ ungen , which can be set immediately by L@@ Ã ¤ ng@@ ere signs . the lists of ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .@@ cw@@ l , which is included in the associated entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L will be entered and the word @-@ negoti@@ ated mode on the men@@ ement mode , or the button extension Ctr@@ l + Alt Le@@ is@@ aste , is replaced by the letter L through the string . \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is replaced .
large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful . however , it was noted that many w@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter can be written more than once more than once . so offers &amp; k@@ ile : the full extension for all already written can be written .
this mode can be set up in the menu of the di@@ ile and can be set out . here you can also set the threshold value for the display of the full length .
the complete files can be installed at the Unter@@ ord@@ ner ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / usr / mode / of personal home folder installed . mode is available for ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ( degrad@@ ation ) or tex .
the dialog box is designed to be designed as simple as possible . for about how to view the bas@@ ins to the graphic files should be considered in sections .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for over , changes and re@@ direc@@ tives of pages . will be re@@ loc@@ ate the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tool a new and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to reach the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all tools are compiled into the men@@ ds to establish comp@@ iling and imag@@ ine view .
for the comp@@ ile of the source texts for Bet@@ ra@@ ises such as &amp; eye@@ piece ; or the additional conversion can be converted to the button , using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file into a PS file converted and using Alt ; 5 the PS file will be converted .
when using the command quick release is normally a viewer required after the comp@@ ile . it should be no longer run . it should be open a new window .
a new project will be held for the project .... The following information are asked for the project :
when the fil@@ ing of the filename , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r -@@ project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile : allows the difference of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ code . the scri@@ pts can be managed in the vertical bars in the vertical body .
the API script are still fully developed and can be developed in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile : even more .
when the first needs to be said that the report for@@ gi@@ veness of Sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te in &amp; k@@ ile : a system@@ atic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; Latex ; is a quite clear system , in which the basic features can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different ways to accommodate users to the user .

often working on a project several persons in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with another . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F7 project project features .
the name and email entries are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves as unique identification .
a member can have several rollers in the project , such as both team manager and sub@@ project manager .
the user can search itself from the list of tea members , who is done . this is done by taking the team member of the list and the button Set@@ ze as expressed as the currently selected Member ( their identification ) is published in the following you : text .
nick@@ name and adjustment of their own identity are important to news and notes . see further information regarding notes .
in addition to overview of her team , there is a further advantage through the acquisition of the team : it can be created a event for information on the team manager if a bit of certain happens . see in for further information .
event actions are promot@@ ions that are executed in a project . an example would be seen , as much someone worked , or the sending of a message that will be secured or a script , which will be a file to the CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;

the settings can be called Qu@@ anta to ... called Qu@@ anta .... This dialogue extends over some pages that are treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding the tags including car can be changed . the entries are :
large / small message of Tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ emati@@ cs are automatically entered . normal Big / Klein@@ sch@@ emati@@ cs means that Tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small sch@@ emati@@ cs of At@@ tri@@ b@@ utes : large / low description of attri@@ butes added to the attri@@ butes to the attri@@ butes that attri@@ butes to the attri@@ butes as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically concl@@ udes : if requested , for the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional Tags automatically : like above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and end day automatically : if switched on , the corresponding resolution is changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic determination of the Ac@@ cent of Ac@@ cent : controls the automatic transformation of ac@@ ute characters in the appropriate code during the ti@@ pp@@ age .
MIME types : Mim@@ et@@ rics for detection of different types of files . using the default setting , default settings can be recovered .
default character set : the coding of newly created or in other way as a file open files ( where the coding of the file can be transferred here ) , but it is up@@ loaded by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for new created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected . this setting is not recognized from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; produced regularly backup cop@@ es , so that the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as the file format . this is not the same as the file is a backup regularly , according to the set period .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in ed@@ itors or own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) what makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the Source text simultaneously .
put the window adjust@@ ments to the standard back when the user interface is useful if the user interface is passed through changing the MDI modes and do@@ cking / depending on each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line .
the warning messages received the tax of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of goods by any more information .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; can also modify the display of symbols instead of scri@@ pts , as well as the synchron@@ isation process of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in divided mode . as regards the different modes see .
here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree that represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ node that can be set in detail in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , it is possible to change it by cli@@ cking the structural tree with the mouse buttons to change this promotion .
in the structural tree settings , the Visi@@ bility of the tree can be opened quickly and how deep in a change of structural tree will be automatically set . empty knots are all the empty areas in the text , while the current document was not found in the current document .

check @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the specified information is properly , if the plug@@ in is not available , but if the plug@@ in is not available , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the fail@@ ure was completely new developed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ugger was implemented , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ugger . instead of which has been implemented a deb@@ ugger plug for plug@@ ins .
currently only an plug@@ in available , support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted .
the use of the deb@@ ugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching deb@@ ugger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the check@@ ing plug @-@ in selection field can be changed for specific settings .
if a deb@@ ugger is enabled , some additional elements available in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface :
a view inside the contents of monitoring variables will appear in the left hand .
a view that are listed in all stops , with line numbers and conditions . appears in the lower do@@ ck .
a view that is shown in the edition ( like HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . it appears normally in the lower do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug , everything or a part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to deb@@ ugger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the Plug@@ in with , on deb@@ ug requirements . this promotion will be opened as a project , that is a deb@@ ugger that must not be des@@ p@@ ised .
the counter@@ part to deb@@ ug session St@@ arte the session . includes the connection to Deb@@ ugger or termin@@ ate it .
s@@ ends an HTTP requirement to the server around a deb@@ ug on the server . this is equ@@ itable with the use of an Brow@@ s@@ ers to see the current document . the issue of this requirement is shown in the screen deb@@ ugger issue .
shows the deb@@ ugger to start with the implementation of the scri@@ pts and information on monitoring variables as well as the currently shown in line . if this happens , the execution is going to be done , the script will start with the requirement of request .
shows the deb@@ ugger to start with the implementation of the scri@@ pts , without information on monitoring variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution goes further . if a deb@@ ug is given , the version will begin as soon as a request .
the deb@@ ugger leads the next statement in the script , without into the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ugger leads the next statement in the script , wher@@ eby if possible in functions and includes error .
shows the deb@@ ugger that go to pass and walk to the next to go , there is no current not .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be used ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . please refer to details for details .
this document describes how to create XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc file ; and also tool@@ boxes . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) defin@@ ing both the specific attri@@ butes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the Fe@@ at@@ alog@@ s ; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file contains the rules and information about &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool set allow a fast insertion of tags in a document without any risk .
day folder are nothing more than folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the names of the writ@@ ers language and version , so available ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ stri@@ ct )
the table below lists the elements of the di@@ XML to and dec@@ l@@ are they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users to have a better viewing and more information on the work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and bo@@ und@@ aries will be explained in simple manner .
this is the root element of an XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it can nothing to do nothing .
the tags of the tags is a script function . when using the use is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an arg@@ ument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class valid . the name of basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type Method . returns the name of the class , where this method belongs to this method . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day is a common At@@ tri@@ but@@ or and the attri@@ butes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . this is an only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can be found only once for each attri@@ bute . in addition , it will be the name and the type of At@@ tri@@ butes . additionally it will be written , like this attri@@ bute , and etc ; This is a only element type element .
the attri@@ butes used for the attri@@ butes of the attri@@ butes for the attri@@ butes in the day ed@@ it@@ or@@ dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p meth@@ od@@ enn@@ ame within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source of data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and meth@@ od@@ ontal names . the arg@@ uments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that can be assigned to the elements of a list . it can only be used for a attri@@ but@@ or description . it &apos;s just a element type element .
puts the position of the attri@@ but@@ able of a tags within a di@@ alog@@ y . this day can be used for each attri@@ bute in one dialog once ( e.g. once for each &amp; l@@ t. &gt; -@@ Day ) . the item is empty .
there is the position and size of a field in Di@@ alogue . this day should be present for every field in the dialog box once ( e.g. one for each &amp; l@@ t. &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements to define the tags within one of the defin@@ ing tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; file type : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encod@@ ing = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be embedded and closed .
do not aff@@ ect nothing but be found on &amp; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces any leg , but some pieces of work would dis@@ appear .
to check the XML files , the Tools dialog above is start at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window and check the X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , check@@ ing only when charging the XML files are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following example for a family 1 di@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file will be sch@@ em@@ a.@@ day .
in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . this file will become an &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function . the filename of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ load@@ .@@ day .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encod@@ ing = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file is also quite simple and there is possible to be easily accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD option . this process can be processed , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = Cre@@ ate 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not indicated , the name is as Nick@@ name .
a action can be created with settings of actions ... be created on New action in the same dialogue :
this promotion can be assigned to the keyboard button . with cli@@ cking the button , a key curve can be removed from the button . the current key can be removed from the button .
the eas@@ i@@ est actions . it may be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of action , this text is inserted in the document to the current c@@ urs@@ or position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful tool type . using this promotion , it can change external applications ( or parts of the document ) that can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) or the various directory in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
as first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter will be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh .
although sk@@ illed paths are recommended to use the % script@@ ures / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scri@@ pts on their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file it will be removed from the document .
% PID : with the PID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process it replaces . if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance , it &apos;s only one instance , if D@@ COP is used to be used if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script will be used .
the parameter for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above , a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can be determined by using &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection box input , what to send the default value . possibilities :
selected text : the selected range of the document is transmitted to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
according to the input , the output can be re@@ directed to the output of the application . there are two types : normal output , based on the standard edition ; error messages should be written to the default edition of the issue :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a own tool@@ bar . in the indicated case it &apos;s not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool bar , you need to add promot@@ ions and con@@ figure actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory . press the New action k@@ op@@ ist at the lower end of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and if the day At@@ tri@@ butes , and you plan your use , activ@@ ate dialog &quot; Day up , when it is possible to use a input during using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is the ideal symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
to establish a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use it from the &amp; k@@ menu ; graphics further programs ( or where it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select File size others .
please note that the original icon does not only helps you know what the action does not do but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
in regard to the day that day start is , I decided to make a start button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is generally interpre@@ ted ) , or should be interpre@@ ted , or should be interpre@@ ted , please click here to insert this symbol no &amp; lt ; -@@ Tag in the current document .
after the creation of symbol , it must be connected to the action . this occurs on the menu with settings through the menu . ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
if you want to use button and set them with other tags , so it gives you , or confirm your OK to complete .
supp@@ ose , you want to adjust some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool@@ bar or it should be shared with some tr@@ ack@@ ers in several groups . open the tool@@ set dialog for Settings tool . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the tr@@ aps ( quite left above ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element that will be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick possibility to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note how the tr@@ ack@@ ers support the group . someone that could not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ ors ; button is the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by Pro@@ try of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the proper folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please check their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; so that their tools will be loaded ( s ) if a file is open from the respective type .
perhaps the mentioned range of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scri@@ pts or the form language . des@@ it describes this chapter , how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Re@@ pository , if a man has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a exist@@ ent documentation for the form@@ at@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need the doc@@ rc file . then we need the doc@@ rc file here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for these docum@@ ent@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation section 1 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , 2 = -@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree defin@@ es the visible part of the documentation tree in documentation . for example , please see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation here :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc thee = php@@ 42 / # top level elements of contents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = , , ... = par@@ as@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = l@@ angu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .@@ html ...
NOTE that # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that there is no familiar border for the cart@@ ons ( except the inter@@ un@@ ing ) md@@ ash ; but try it itself .
they know that the contents directly to a file refer@@ enced ( and consist@@ ently ) at the upper end of the tree view &amp; md@@ ash ; file will be displayed ! ) .
do not aff@@ ect nothing but be found on &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ files are replaced .
the syn@@ tax @-@ section is the range of the doc@@ rc file , which serves as the documentation of the function named and press of Ctr@@ l ; H for Cont@@ ext Help , the documentation directly indicated . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connectors .
a simple list of two separate context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ rc file , save as $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then you create a folder ( as you like this in your file doc@@ rc ) , as doc@@ rc and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this is well and worth it , please send your doc@@ rc files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to use the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they are not rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tools with actions , scri@@ pts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send via E@@ Mail to friends , partners or else to have sent to send an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email ship , tool@@ bar menu of files and folders on templates and in scri@@ pts .
the resources can be loaded in our main archive where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can be checked and only available , if our team needs more than correct and effective for the release . the source of resources are guaranteed , both for our team as well as for later users .
while up@@ loading will not be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you can search one out . in the dialog of New resource , you can find out a detailed ( URL @-@ preview can remain un@@ loading ) and click OK for the upload of OK .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the men@@ us D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) package , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te tree .
after download a resource , even before installation , studied &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the dis@@ abilities of the integ@@ r@@ ity and Sig@@ ni@@ zation . if the integ@@ r@@ ity are given and it can be demol@@ ished . if the integ@@ r@@ ity are given and the resource is correct with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which currently is currently being created by using an D@@ TE@@ P package is needed , because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format may be needed . there are the eas@@ i@@ est way to convert an D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD shop and convert a D@@ TD option . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which will be used . there@@ after the following dialogue :
destination : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p file .
! DO@@ C@@ TYPE defin@@ itions : the string , which in ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE Tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / etc e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will be released
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; editor , which can be adapted to use the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is a few key concepts . to move these to understand and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to make them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , loc@@ ally and proj@@ ect@@ ile . this differenti@@ ation is concern@@ ed for a series of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses everything that global tool should be saved in shared folders of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administr@@ ators of different tools , actions and samples in the global tree , which will be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web developer for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific designs and tools . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use this user pers@@ onally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this may be said all of &amp; CSS ; -@@ Must@@ ern up to tool strips with special actions especially for the files of a certain project , which is the most common use of special tools and samples of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the building views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ boxes . please suggest you in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document as close to the current , other or all cartridges , re@@ loading , delete or upload the document , jump to a perm@@ al@@ ink or type of CV@@ S command to the current document .
right click in ed@@ itors to a further context menu of the document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / sign ) , editing of the mouse po@@ inter or open the file if the string , below the mouse po@@ inter is called a file .
at the upper end of the ed@@ itors of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Trans@@ itional will be displayed as standard , for the set of tools and quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ boxes are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tools are really easy . if you want to insert it , please click the symbol that you would like to specify the day that you can specify the data for this straight . now , you can add the data for this straight , you can add several attri@@ butes to fill in a dialog different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navig@@ ate to open information &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navig@@ ate to open and di@@ stor@@ tion . in the representation of boxes , project , pattern templates , document structure , script , attri@@ butes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool for the project &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; preparations are all files in the project and perm@@ its management files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as regards , loading , loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection them are always available , local templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant users and templates are only available in the project . more templates available in this project .
here you can find information about the available scri@@ pts . this is also available here . by cli@@ cking with the left mouse button , you can also call the available information on a script will be available here like e.g. the script will be able to work or send via email .
with this view it shows the internal structure of the active document . by links on the element of the element , the c@@ urs@@ or will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and review of the tree .
this tree appears under the other building views . with him , some quickly attri@@ butes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this is the change of all available attri@@ butes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . it can be presented to create a documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; docum@@ ent@@ ations@@ site can be presented and considered a folder doc to a project can be edited documents and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes can be achieved at the lower end of the window , via the effective information can be used : the news window and the problem .
this cardboard box shows information about any in Qu@@ anta &apos;s running sk@@ elet@@ pt . such as the just used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD is shown .
this cardboard box shows all error in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te which are executed , give all error messages ( so that there is ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ boxes are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the respective command . the chocolate prepare is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; s@@ ends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; and if you get an tool@@ bar in an E@@ Mail , they can secure this in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other features and load !
it is s@@ ensi@@ ble if you want to fit the place of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to get there a number of options that can specify the con@@ figure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / con@@ figure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here .
if you have problems at the species of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 I folders . also you should make sure no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optim@@ ised for a rapid web development and combines a sophist@@ icated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while efforts to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to emplo@@ y the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ ent market @-@ languages Editor would now be , it would be an independent Web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done ! so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , and quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be in &amp; XML ; then it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above mentioned above , that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is based . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is not possible to use other things ? thanks to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ rum@@ our is not only everything possible , but it allows users to extend users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows for use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand the productivity almost every task . by the program Comm@@ ander you can find &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; expand without any sk@@ pt@@ l@@ yn@@ syn@@ tax . ( more about it will be found in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web developer environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed to develop a fast web development and was upgr@@ aded to a sophist@@ icated Editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; connected to the original developers , the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of this documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either the URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help hel@@ ms@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and man@@ ages by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequences @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
an express list of files that you have opened . this list takes place any file , which is not on it , wher@@ eby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save your code parts and all files as templates for later use . check out in the section above templates . should you try to save the selected file / text outside of local / Project Management Software , will only be a mist@@ ake .
converted from the intermediate shelf there is special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sch@@ emati@@ cs , so that they are displayed correctly and not given from the brow@@ s@@ ers as a form@@ at@@ ation instructions .

the changes in this dialogue is affected every application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brow@@ s@@ ers .
the behaviour of the ed@@ itors is one . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you want to remove the entries from the tool@@ bars or which can add or to the row sequences .
this should produce a help in the mouse po@@ inter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as at every Open Source project , the developers can always be used . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from above to the bottom of the project called for the rest of the project called for the rest of the project . all these paths can be automatically completed later with Shift ; F7 Projekt project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . if the input of the name is automatically filled in file .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project File . by default it has the names of the project in small letters and without spaces ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file will be stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine that you can access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ el@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you can use this field , the default settings of the selected protocol is required . depending on the remote computer might be necessary .
this is the file to be saved in which templates for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , these folders should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tools are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , these folders should be set instead of the standards .
allows you to add files from local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or all files .
this setting is great if you want to download the static web@@ content , you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ ged script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) must be different .
re@@ act when files that are somew@@ here in the main folder of the project , which will be bound in the main folder where a project is due to be re@@ boot .
with this option you will appear all files and folders within the main folder and you can take a precise selection according to usage .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by the hook or remove from the left hand , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings , which can easily fit your work in the menu with the Projekt Project Properties tab on the sub @-@ window profiles or using the keyboard shift ; F7 .
some settings are equivalent to those in the project assistant and are described in the additional entries below .
a list of file names is possible to ign@@ ore the projects with proj@@ ect@@ oral operations such as a project ord@@ ner .
additional option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excl@@ uded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded at opening of the project . in order to be read more about project views .
it can be selected for the desired deb@@ ugger . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ugger Line Plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in the monitor is described .
in the window profiles can be set high loads ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , offering an own tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see in detail details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , you can change event actions and change these actions , change or er@@ ase . event man@@ ages , if a previously certain event will appear , like about the bl@@ in@@ als of a file . see in detail details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project was opened , this behavi@@ or cannot be affected .
to open a different project , select project open from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar file . the dialog project will open and allows you to choose a project . projects .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . they are asked if you want to store if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you want to load a new project .
the project construction view gives free access to the files in the project . there can be the files in the current project .
file behavi@@ or , however , missing the entries and open the entries with the right mouse button on the right mouse menu :
here different profiles can be found here . the profile contains information on the site of the upload files . see .
allows remov@@ ing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will end the button to prevent remov@@ ing distances .
the password will be kept in core memory and in program@@ mer . this possibility is useful when the most frequent upload files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate save -@@ option is not available in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply change the dialog when you change your opinion in front of the upload .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high lad@@ y profiles can be created and thus up@@ loaded the project ( or parts of the project ) to various server . when working or creating a profile , this dialog is shown :
this is the name of the server to be cop@@ ied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address should work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed k@@ io sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( loc@@ ally ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administr@@ ator is not possible on the usual port .
depending on your spru@@ ce , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . do it be saved on the plate , so that it may not be read , but any of programming can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tools . it can be downloaded in a project many views , i.e. by easy diving of view , many files and tools are loaded and replace the currently drawn files and tools .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings the tool bar tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one do most to do so . this helps do not increase productivity but also perm@@ its the adjustment of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own desktop .
as already mentioned above are tools in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best about the menu tool@@ bars . use and add to the tool@@ bars . the Add of tool@@ boxes will be treated below the section of tool@@ boxes .
the tool@@ boxes and the symbols can be set to be set to the tool@@ bar ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , it can be set to set any tools like tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar , what can be displayed in the dialog , where you can be displayed on these or other tools .
by App@@ eal of the context menu to a promotion ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally displayed the entries and action list , which are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory .
the tool@@ boxes and actions on them can set up on them in the menu with settings and settings through the settings ..
templates are in the main document of documents , code es@@ cal@@ opes and files to lin@@ king . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates generally as a spl@@ en@@ ches fil@@ esystem with advanced organisation and interfaces . can be cop@@ ying &amp; each of the system existing directory in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the lim@@ itations , which represents the file system for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided conditions for their application . please read the conditions in front of any template at the beginning of every template .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually published in documents using lin@@ ings ( e.g. images with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found under global templates . further information on templates tree is available .
documents can be published by any text document type . based on this template can be created new documents in corresponding way to be effici@@ ently and organi@@ zes the work in corresponding way to be effici@@ ently . some examples may be found under global templates . see also for more information on templates tree .
this type templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text could always be inserted into the documents . you can find all examples of a comment on Jav@@ ascript or Per@@ l basis . some examples are available at global templates . see also for more information on templates tree .
as the name says , serve this templates for all sites as templates . you can be arranged a collection of various documents that can be combined in a compressed t@@ ar @-@ Archive . currently there is no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
draw a document structure to taste ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a copy as a local template ....
as soon as this happened , you notice that ( even if a project is stored ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the plant tree under project management .
please select the text in your document and click here as a copy selection as local / project templates . alternatively , the choice is simply pul@@ ling with scre@@ ened and put on the tree view .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only one of the file formats . it can be used to be used to view and insertion or insertion over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can enter into the file tree or in the project files tree view on a folder on the right click and site please select a name for the template , but naturally can be saved as local or global template .
project templates enable a very zi@@ el@@ oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot files or in addition , or with them link . in addition there are some things that keep on templates very de@@ found in eye on the eye .
the system structure in the window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates are displayed in one of four types of containers such as above .
to select the behaviour of a folder to click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low , as soon as El@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction attri@@ butes .
this is standard enabled by default and fits all branches in the process of models . if a tribe lack@@ ing would be exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly disabled , except it would be exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly enabled . if nothing would be exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly in this path . if nothing appears , it is likely to be in a Chief Apostle .
allows the ordered or not@@ ified text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ steps into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot files a whole presentation already using the matching head@@ lines / foot files .
additionally , you have the context menu ( to show , right mouse button ) on a complete command collection for the Add folder of files or cop@@ ying templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; and source text Editor , which replaces the menu click here . the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he inv@@ ites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ urs@@ or . then you can editing and if needed to the source code editor , which are visible in the source code in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on an Document , which &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol to editing the V@@ PL ; editing . it is not possible to e@@ dit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing , is still the source code editor . there is no plans to change this behavi@@ or .
the second Mode works just like the first , except that the c@@ urs@@ or in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; editor are syn@@ ch@@ ron in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the key pressure of the active c@@ urs@@ or of a window to others , wher@@ eby the position can be kept in the document .
the synchron@@ ous distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code is adjustable via a choice of V@@ PL ; -@@ view can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . generally the recommendation can be set automatically . generally , the recommendation can be set to a small range for quick calcul@@ ator and a great s@@ anne for slow .
if you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the processing of inv@@ isible Tags with the V@@ PL ; editor . this document is also called , once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to change the reduction of the spring hook . this means you can change the following :
Met@@ a tags designed the storage of information about the document , e.g. key@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added to the memory of the content , such as key@@ words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents of column .
CSS rules are the new way of the design of the testim@@ ony of the testim@@ ony . you can add CSS rules on the list or delete . a change about the list is exactly like in the Met@@ a elements . the Edit of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to adjust the external CSS style templates only by cli@@ cking on the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of c@@ urs@@ or is like in a paper processing , because of conveni@@ ence with arrows , the c@@ urs@@ or can be used as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted with button or remove button or remov@@ ing button .
the insertion of tags will be taken in the same way about the tool@@ boxes , like in the source code Editor , please note that the insertion of tags is already existing if an anchor day , surrounded by text , must be inserted with text , any other um@@ bl@@ ers must be removed .
some tools like the Tables @-@ Assi@@ stent or the Li@@ sten @-@ Assi@@ stent are de@@ activated . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; the tables or lists have to be used in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style templates . in contrast to other programs , the search for certain elements are possible and the execution of the Stil@@ vor@@ s can be pursu@@ ed .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to compens@@ ate successfully , except &amp; K@@ DE ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml which are already available with a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available .

there are many graphical tools for Compare . why then &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; ? let me expl@@ ain why I wrote .
the mer@@ ger was very comp@@ lic@@ ated because one of the contributions is correc@@ ted and correc@@ ted many places in the same file . a further programming had changed in the same file . the result were numerous conflict with m@@ erging .
the program found me just the changed lines , I could not see what exactly are changed within this lines . and there were no crit@@ ics to the places where you could only be changed . this comp@@ ilation of this changes was a smaller album .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the differences between one line and changes in white signs . later , there were even more useful functions .
if you want to compare this text , copy it simply into the cli@@ p@@ board and add him in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made much work was the Compare and mer@@ ger of Ord@@ ers . this function ver@@ tically &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ ready file @-@ browser .
also 3 @-@ way inter@@ connection is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece co@@ atings and Ch@@ anges . the original file is able to process the result of conflic@@ ts and shows the result even directly . the screen photo shows the result even directly . the screen photo shows three quiz files at m@@ erging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also complete with the Compare and M@@ erging complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the folder coll@@ ap@@ ses :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the ex@@ ak@@ ened differences and test@@ ify these opportunities heu@@ res of color mon@@ it@@ ore . if you &apos;ll need to check these function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed only in a certain amount of white signs , you can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no doctors more if J@@ em@@ and the changes changes ) .
if a file is equal , and the other one diff@@ ers in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files are distingu@@ ished .
if all files the same name , but in different folders , you can fac@@ ilit@@ ating the animal work easier to write the file names of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ ner k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ ?
the Open dialog allows manual change of file names , select a selection of the file list . the Open dialog box will notice your selection and displays them at the next time . you need to place the record for C empty , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files .
over the button folders .... you can also select a folder where you will select the folder or mer@@ ger from Ord@@ ers . if A file is selected , for B and C however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in both other files .
if m@@ erging is cross@@ ed , the input field is active for the goal and can not be necess@@ arily to use immediately an output file . you can also download this step later when saving .
introduc@@ ing button button opens a dialog with settings . here you can start options before you start with the Compare / summ@@ ers .
sometimes you want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the interactive comparison period . the comparison starts now , you can select the dialog box with the ab@@ om@@ iting button .
you can also use decorative and install : drag simply a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ative window .
what thought about ? sometimes contains a file such as many similar functions . if you &apos;ll need to create a relatively large effort . you would like to create a relatively large effort . you can easily copy and compare these relevant sections . now you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare .
NOTE : currently , you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; only the coral re@@ print of text in a comparison @-@ window is supported .
warning : some ed@@ itors interpre@@ t the scre@@ en@@ ings and put text into another program as a cut and insertion ( instead of copy and insertion ) . in such case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each tex@@ tures the info @-@ line contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( please note that window C is optional ) , let the mouse over the line . then the mouse over the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the complete name .
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a number of paint blue , B and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is known , one of the file is distingu@@ ished . if both files are distingu@@ ished , the default colour is red . ( color for conflic@@ ts in the settings ) . the color sch@@ eme is particularly useful when you can see three files . this is in the next section ( guide ) .
in addition to the text is the mer@@ ger column . if differences were found , shows the column the appropriate colour . if different programming languages where white signs is not so important to see the relevant changes only . ( at C / C + + , B. are white signs only relevant in character strings and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the inter@@ locking column from the text , where the respective source file does not activ@@ ate any lines . if the line break is activated , the line turned into broken lines .
the windows window ( among the comparison @-@ star ) also has a info @-@ line with the in@@ scription edition : , the filename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have already edited by the automatic m@@ erging them , but often also contains conflic@@ ts .
! ! ! until all conflic@@ ts are dissol@@ ved , the Save disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jum@@ ps to be sol@@ dered to the same sol@@ dered / UN@@ GEL@@ O Conf@@ lic@@ t to find the remaining conflic@@ ts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference is trig@@ ger@@ ed at the same time , too .
by a click with the left mouse button in one of the window , the first line will be displayed in the windows and the first line of the group will not be visible in the beginning of the group . this group will be high@@ ligh@@ ted in the beginning of the group . this group will be high@@ ligh@@ ted and if the left is an black beams .
sometimes , sometimes , in this line , there is no further line more in the group . this text is not indicated in this lines ; No line in the qu@@ el@@ es ; No line in the final stored file , nor in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ ings you may be cop@@ ying and wo@@ unded .
the text &amp; lt ; comp@@ eting handle ; however , appears in the intermediate shelf when you copy such text from the result window . go forward with this function .
NOTE : when cho@@ osing the sources that options are ign@@ ore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or reviews are as such as white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly with the image cartridges and the mouse , you can also use the keyboard keys left , right , high , r@@ under , page , at the beginning , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ at and can also be used by other programs . the over@@ throw column next to the vertical image drive can be used by hin@@ ge .
in the eye window you can also use the other keys to work . with insertion -@@ button you can change between insertion and transfer mode . ( default is the insertion mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button to synchroni@@ zes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section of M@@ erging and the ed@@ itable issue date ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference , to the next / prec@@ eding conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ image up@@ wards ) or to the next / prec@@ eding conflict . therefore , that &apos;s not automatically dissol@@ ved according to the manual dis@@ orders . therefore , must be resol@@ ved between dissol@@ ved and UN@@ GEL@@ ST@@ EN conflic@@ ts .
to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy @-@ button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ insertion ) , you will also specify automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual cop@@ ying . be with this option , for you could write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line @-@ related operating system are stored according to the accessible operating system \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line length of the source files which you should not use &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most used files will automatically be saved at the end automatically and will be recovered at the next start . ( menu adjust@@ ing &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 )
choose a font with fixed width . ( in some systems , the dialog box is also using variable width to choice , you should not use it . )
if you can activ@@ ate this option , differences in short let@@ tering . if the selected script will not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors are not available in their pure form , but would be represented in their pure form . to this systems , the button viewer automatically creates a un@@ lock colour .
if this option is activated , the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise it is inserted a table character .
if you press the input or return , the insertion of the previous line will also be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , any selection automatically cop@@ ied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ ing @-@ type you can prefer to store you prefer . the default value is the general selection on the operating system .
when using files tries &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be ig@@ no@@ red in the source files . the second step can be ig@@ no@@ red . the second step will not be ig@@ no@@ red . in this step , white signs are not ig@@ no@@ red .
some ed@@ itors &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then could save files with different sizes in the end of a row , but then could save files with different sizes in the side @-@ side @-@ side comparison , but even as one white signs . during the mer@@ ger , this option has to be disabled this option this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ig@@ no@@ red . in the result , the differences are displayed , but they are covered like white signs .
this option is de@@ activated this option . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intense after smaller sub@@ sid@@ ers . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective at comp@@ lic@@ ated and large files but slowly at very large files .
in the Auto @-@ Entertainment mode determ@@ ines this setting as long as the result of the selection will be det@@ ained before the next UN@@ GEL@@ O Conf@@ lic@@ t .
dissol@@ ve automatic all conflic@@ ts in white signs by the chosen file as a source . if you are useful if white signs are less important . if you are aware that the automatic selection includes conflic@@ ts in numbers or comments concerning the options of ign@@ or@@ ating or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are identified in chapter for scanning of files and perform a mer@@ ger . look for details below documentation regarding the directory and mer@@ ger .
if a file is stored and already a older version exists , the original version of the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original depends on such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this is without further back .
the language of user interface . changing this option is not able to finish the current program . you need to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted on global control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if necessary this option is activated for all the top setting .
the selection buttons for coding is a short note that is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a pure inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . these influ@@ ences , as special characters and interpre@@ ting the coding for any file can be individually adjustable , even files with different coding .
if you have processed a file , you can order here which coding coding for stor@@ ing .
if you can define the target command , they could not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. might be your files 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ vent@@ ing command can only be encod@@ ed with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
do not turn off to press Her@@ ed@@ ness of changes in white signs in the text or super@@ vision . ( NOTE : this applies to changes in numbers or reviews if the options are ign@@ ore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . )
this selection is only available when you want to see three files . in normal mode , all differences in a far@@ mer encod@@ ed column . but sometimes , you may only see the differences between two of three files ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is indicated next to the normal time a second over@@ throw column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available square on the screen for long lines . easy to use the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
the compar@@ ing window next to each other or other . this can be useful for displays of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and deci@@ de to exec@@ ute the files . you will only compare the files from the last source file as a preset name for the output file names . ( if this function is used to start the mer@@ ger , the name of the last used output file will be re@@ tain . )
when reading a file , it will be delivered to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ use , the output of the command is visible , and not the file . you can use your own pre@@ vent@@ ing , which allows to use your own pre@@ vent@@ ing parts , or to correct inter@@ ference parts or to correct the feeding .
when reading a file , it was given first to the command of this external command . the edition of the command is specified only for the line of the command . you can write your own pre@@ vent@@ ing command . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the thought behind is to enable the user more flexibility when using the di@@ ff Results . but most users would like to program the good even the good news . the good news is , however , that in most cases s@@ ed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ vent@@ ing command for line @-@ equ@@ ally converting : s@@ ed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; Das . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary article in a row . the \ \ 1 in the design string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ ause . the \ \ U converts the found text in large case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key@@ words to insert the possible keys ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Subst@@ itu@@ tion ) . once you can change the list of key@@ words . the \ \ from the $ is necessary because $ a special characters can be found and at the end of the line .
while you have to experim@@ ent with s@@ ed , you don &apos;t want to understand , and perhaps the regular ex@@ pres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support the very similar items .
the ign@@ ore of figures is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example of an additional processing command for line ab@@ use . s@@ ed &apos;s / &#91; 012@@ 345@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; J@@ edes character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so qu@@ asi .
sometimes , you would like to perform multiple editing at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of one another . example :
instead of s@@ ed , you can also use any other like e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Release / Switch &apos; All Details differ@@ ently . where s@@ ed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal pre@@ processor are needed for the display and merge operations . other operations are only the data that sees the line @-@ equal alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm .
NOTE : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , setting the line of the normal pre@@ processor @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with every function , the text is changed or differences , you can do not notice certain differences and in the wor@@ st case important data .
often , program@@ mer must work in a folder many files . from this reason you can compare and together with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes an suggest@@ ion to comp@@ ete ; you can adjust the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the comp@@ ute and displays the sim@@ ulated changes , without they really exec@@ ute ,
... , selected actions either with all ( F7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ button ) ,
this is the Compare and comp@@ ilation of individual files very similar . you need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders will be used as basis , folder is used as basis . if no goal was given , is used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 .
NOTE that only the comparison of files will automatically start the mer@@ ger . to start the mer@@ ger , you must select the menu entry or the F7 key . ( further details follow . )
while taking the folder you want to read a small news window over the current progress . if you read the file scanning , only the files are listed until then compared to the time .
if the scan is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; a li@@ sten@@ window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and any file of the scan is found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the Ord@@ n@@ erst@@ ru@@ structure is usually displayed . you can use a folder or by cli@@ cking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of the sub@@ direc@@ tories and all the sub@@ direc@@ tories are you to install all the folder or split .
if you click on a file , the file will start and it appears to be a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name refl@@ ects the file type in the first folders ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type in the other files are different , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . if the mer@@ ger will start automatically , you will inform about problems of this sort .
as shown in the above picture can be seen in columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
same as identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries are different .
the folder are regard@@ ed as identical if their own content is identical . then , the same color . at Ord@@ ers , the age is un@@ significant for his color .
the idea for this color sch@@ ema is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors refl@@ ect the colors of a blade again , which is only green is and later when it is old , red is red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete c@@ els if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete cap@@ el , if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the k@@ iss if it exists )
... A , B and C not the same data type ( e.g. if A a file and B one file is ) : Error : cont@@ radi@@ ance data types . such as missing objects , the result cannot be started .
... A and B not the same data type ( e.g. if A a file and B one file is ) : Error : cont@@ radi@@ ance data types . such as missing objects exist , the mer@@ chand@@ ise cannot be started .
the mode to synchroni@@ ze is active if only two folders and no exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ator is specified and if the option direc@@ tories are synchroni@@ ze . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action is identical to both the file . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ger and the result in both files are saving . ( the user can see the visible file names for the output file only B ; direct after mer@@ ger &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be managed and select the option New file instead of m@@ apping ( un@@ secure ) , but the same date shall be found error , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such mist@@ akes , the comp@@ ilation of the files can &apos;t be started .
while the mer@@ ger will run a file after the others . you are the status column shows F@@ erti@@ g , when the mer@@ ger was successful , and if something un@@ expected , you should see a final review and see if the status is anywhere in order .
when in the setup dialog box is chosen , K@@ Diff@@ 3 other columns are displayed . these include the number of un@@ sol@@ ved , sol@@ ved , not white and white conflic@@ ts . ( the column for sol@@ ved conflic@@ ts will only be displayed if three folders compared or together ) .
you can lead either the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ si@@ ck @-@ promot@@ ions ( also in all sub@@ files ) , you can start the mer@@ ger .
please note : if you have no objectives specified , then it will be used in the three @-@ folder @-@ merge mode C as destination as the goal and when synchroni@@ zing , A and / or B will be used as target .
if you have selected a goal , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the goal of the target . there are some options through the specific entries . we will check these options to avoid un@@ favour@@ able sur@@ prises :
to comp@@ ose all entries : select direc@@ tories in the list -@@ menu or press F7 ( the key curve ) . to exec@@ ute the actual entry : select action of the current element or press F6 .
if by cont@@ radi@@ ant data types , even more inv@@ alid mer@@ ger actions exist , a message appears to select the f@@ aul@@ ty elements . you can choose a valid action .
if you run all entries , the dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate sim@@ ulate and break .
if you want to see what would you want to pass , without the really changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 , then leads certain actions with all entries due to . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then opens a guide window ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready to start using a file , select or press F7 . if you are not saved , a corresponding dialogue . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you can help you to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . so you have the opportunity to select a different action for the entry or the problem to solve the problem before joining the mer@@ ger .
if some entries are individually led , noted &amp; k@@ diff@@ use of all entries are not together . even if the result of all entries are regard@@ ed or not saved , these entries are considered as er@@ le@@ ur . only if you want to change the merge action , these entries will once again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a part named directory m@@ erging with these options :
only files that can be displayed in the element tree , are shown in the element tree . separate space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders that cor@@ respond to this pattern , do not be entered in the element tree , do not use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ; as a separ@@ ating character . valid positions : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .

ign@@ ore files that will be ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ched files are ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is set to be used by .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore -@@ file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a ver@@ ify -@@ attri@@ bute . in other file systems marked a file as hide . this option lets you deci@@ de whether these files can be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
links to files : if the option is switched on . if the option is switched on . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default value .
if the option is switched on if the option is switched on . if the option is switched on . if the option is enabled , the links like normal parts would conduc@@ t and recur@@ si@@ v . a link on a link would lead to a final grinding and &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) this option is switched on .
a complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistic columns . ( the number dissol@@ ved , un@@ low and white conflic@@ ts . ) The complete analysis is slow as an easy binary analysis , and much s@@ lower than they contained files . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you want to compare large folder on a slow network , it is possibly faster , just the change date and file size . this speed will cost you however . please use the file . this option is based on the default value .
similar to the an@@ ch@@ ment date . there is no real comparison instead . the files will be considered as identical as the copy of the change date . please contact with int@@ ention . this option is based on the default value .
activ@@ ate the synchroni@@ ze mode if two folders compared to the mer@@ ger , the suggest@@ ions will be selected so that both the file are identical . also the results from m@@ erging files are stored in both Ord@@ ers . this option is stored in the default value .
if it is differ@@ ently , instead of the mer@@ ger , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an un@@ secure , because the other file is not changed . it should check this option in any case . ) this option is available in default .
if a file or file is replaced by another device , the original version is ren@@ amed , then the original version is ren@@ amed , this without further backup file . this is also the normal m@@ erging of single files , not only the comp@@ ete folder . this option is switched on .
normally , the folder folder will be visible on the mer@@ ger of single files ; you can switch the window list with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window folder &amp; text windows from the folder &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file using double click . nevertheless , there is a single file to add a single file . as soon as you can store this file , the status is set to reset , and the file will not run again when you run the folder .
this status goes lost when you want to read the directory : directory menu : Read more
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can add files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line equ@@ als a local file with an FTP server . the second command line has a folder within a compressed archive with a local file .
one URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can not be relatively . or .. containing UR@@ Ls not possible , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Le@@ er@@ ran@@ ge@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system , sometimes the protocol used through the protocol . it follows a short list of lim@@ itations :
or it can not be different , whether a link to a file or folder will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to work in auth@@ orized or reference date . therefore , so@@ aking the auth@@ orization of the original . ( please note the option of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose tra@@ ilers is currently available as differences bet@@ we@@ et in K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . K@@ fi@@ vel@@ op starts first always start the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part Show from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; two full input files . if it is used to select a patch file in the uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ uses 3 ; the names of the original files has to exist at least one of the two files . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to recover the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the Compare from two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the guide or the Compare in files are not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is there ) there are already . also the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 is already shown that it may lead to diff@@ use the program diff@@ use from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use G@@ PL programs already very long and have much learned by using other programs in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mer which have gone down or standing him .
you did not compiled the program from the sources and the con@@ figure script will not be shared to K@@ DE . in the default setting installed con@@ figure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you can find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs differ@@ ently , these lines are available as identical ; but if only one @-@ white signs is different , the line is not identical . if you do not only one @-@ white signs , this is the next to each other , this D@@ is co@@ ffe but this qu@@ is of the case .
the Editor is intended for any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply called as text file , and it is too much effort to design extra a own file format that could save this information .
the expenditure was to be large . you can use a specific version always by using a source A / B / C . in order to process larger quantities of the text should be used to be different editor .
after the list of text is suddenly according to No src lenses ; released and text can be del@@ eting . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; uses many colors to be distingu@@ ished by differenti@@ ated . even more power would be ver@@ wor@@ se and is missing the purpose . use the other editor .
many good ideas and f@@ ault reports came out of colleagues and many people from the wild wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
you can use K@@ user 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes will be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to create &amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; you need to comp@@ iling and install the following command in the basic version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder where your system is installed in the K@@ DE . if you &apos;re un@@ secure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have any problems at comp@@ ile . they should occur in trouble , report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ list .
cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ removal ) cop@@ ied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insertion ( Str@@ g @-@ V or um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ insertion ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current c@@ urs@@ or position .
only differences in all files are identical in all files are not appear in the Ord@@ n@@ erst@@ ru@@ structure , and therefore not in the objective .
( in the current program version you need to read the folder to these options with the update update . )
it will be displayed only to the differences that identical files at mer@@ cury . if the target file will not be cop@@ ied to the target . ( the behaviour is probably changed in a later program version probably changed . ) This option is switched on .
please note the buttons for the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar , the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are already present ) . if the lines are already present , they are already installed on the button .
in the default setting this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ show all virtual work surfaces . it &apos;s quite convenient to change its size to change their size , it works to change or to post@@ p@@ one . this works both within a working area as well as many .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be selected all virtual work areas as well as the application areas . applications can be selected and even on the working area and even to others .
with the Middle walls , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; moving motion is possible in both working area as well as other operations .
the context menu depends on the empty background , where the context menu is cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu is only the icon and the name of application as well as the result of application , maxim@@ ize , on working area and sending . the prec@@ epts following commands :
maxim@@ ally the application window on the full size of the working area . appears only if you want to cli@@ cked on a application .
send the application for the selected virtual work area . if possible when application was cli@@ cked .
if this point is marked , window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be shi@@ fted to the desktop and other working areas .
when this field is cross@@ ed , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual work areas .
en@@ abling this field lets you show the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas . is it together with name displayed , the names are provided with Ord@@ inal@@ is , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area .
when this field is cross@@ ed , the background of each working area is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is cross@@ ed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed only the empty work@@ tops are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here is the view of the window window . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program . NOTE : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : Classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n Grid appear as from P@@ ager @-@ applications appear in some other windows areas in a vertical right and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular in a vertical row , which is very good for the representation on the sides of the working area .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has changed that it can be changed in the size , the window as symbols or with their content and move it out outside the control bar .

&amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , once the mouse po@@ inter is a while on the same place . it is thought to help people that make the RS@@ I syndrome ( Re@@ pet@@ iti@@ oning @-@ inj@@ ury syndrome ) and of which each mouse click is prepared .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , once the mouse po@@ inter ( RS@@ I ) Syn@@ drome , and which each mouse cli@@ cking is prepared . furthermore , it can handle the bri@@ cks with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can create the pain , which causes the mouse and helps to use any pain . unfortunately , suffering from pain that are using your computer , you should not need a doctor if you do not happen if the use of your computer .
in order to adjust it again : even if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to create pain that are caused by pain that applies to pain that applies to the mouse because of all the ergonomic tool : the result can drop to any different aspect ratio .
the use of &amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool is simple : &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse mot@@ ions and leads a mouse click away , once you break the movement shortly .
is the intelligent de@@ activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; a break when it is pressing the mouse button . move the mouse button to pass the mouse button . the intelligent drive requires a little practice but you can get used quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement must be enough after the end of the mouse movement ; before &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; you will get a mouse click .
is an intelligent comp@@ ati@@ al clock , the rotation rate is set up ( 1 / 10 s ) , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; after the her@@ pres@@ sures the mouse back , if the mouse is no longer run , if in@@ gest@@ ion is no evidence of the mouse .
&amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; now it is activated by cli@@ cking cli@@ cking on the right and back , followed by a break , click on the right and back , followed by a break . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es@@ .txt ; the first time started , they can be changed later .
if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; add the reaction time to short@@ ened sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the Rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer for you to short@@ ened to a lower value to short@@ ened the response time .
if this setting is marked &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; started with every start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window , please refer to the appropriate documentation , as you will start there a program .
sets all settings on the values back to the opening of the dialogue . have already pressed the button on the stand after the last pres@@ sures of approach .
best use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . in particular Intelligent storage life should be switched off . if you are looking forward to the automatic mouse click , you can go to the intelligent drive .
if you want to use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; K@@ DE ; for sounds .
first , you should make sure to make a mouse click without effect : the cli@@ cking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not hes@@ itate to unc@@ ertain@@ ly reactions . you can use the mouse on such digits , until you want to use it .
if your mouse is used , you should make your mouse . that &apos;s rather simple . the tri@@ ck is quite simple . the tri@@ ck is not only the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball in contact .
first , you must take out the mouse ball , as it is done , from mouse to mouse . it should be clearly clear when you watch the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you can see the cast@@ ors . these are on the sides of the hole that the ball was used . the tri@@ ck and the cont@@ amination can be easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
in very rare situ@@ ations the operating system used by &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re just a shift process , this means that &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool does not make sure that &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool is not able to end the surgery .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; use and move on another window bearings and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you can exec@@ ute a mouse click . here is the status of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can re@@ warded as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse cli@@ cks and sets the c@@ urs@@ or to another place .
Work@@ around : use the mouse to place the c@@ urs@@ or to place where you want to place the mouse on a neutral area of the mouse and eg . safe zones for the mouse po@@ inter . safe zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas of tools and men@@ us and the cover files of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent comp@@ ilation , but I don &apos;t make it to e@@ dit the text .
the intelligent comp@@ ass is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes you to copy it to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and will move into the cli@@ cking or any other action , when you are going to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here , some are doing any advice on this way :
do not use the intelligent comp@@ ose if you just start to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; click here . select text instead of a mouse click here , while you turn to move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again the mouse control again .
to use the phone mouse click here . therefore , if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool you will play a sound like a mouse click . so , you can use the intelligent push @-@ up period . later you can use the intelligent push @-@ click with no audi@@ ble click . but it is required to use it .
to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test enlargement for &amp; X window ; this should be installed on most system .
the functionality of the headphones mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker , and these are correct .
&amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; operated the mouse button once the mouse po@@ inter . this program was developed for people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome and to them the man@@ ages of m@@ oul@@ ds pain .
&amp; mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as con@@ figure that it starts a certain time before the mouse button will start before the mouse button . in this way , it can also be done on this way , and put the mouse with the mouse .

if this menu is cross@@ ed with entries displayed . the strip is arranged by default window directly under the tool bar directly under the tool bar . by mouse cli@@ cking on the narrow left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be shi@@ fted to another place .
probably you do not have the command for voice edition isn &apos;t properly or not complete . open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice speech on the map viewer . ( see setup dialog for voice synth@@ esizer to further details . )
the festival is a voice edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch supports this license to use Festival free to use and without restri@@ ctions .
in order to show an example of command line for setting the language edition , will ass@@ ume that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to language function is then :
Free@@ TT@@ S is an in &amp; Java ; pres@@ cri@@ bed language generators . currently it supports only the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ TT@@ S for free and without restri@@ ctions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the setup of language edition is assumed that Free@@ TT@@ S is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ etts . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option has to be switched as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ TT@@ S . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the acceptance that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / h@@ adi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is gl@@ ad@@ ly like the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be inserted . the complete command is therefore much more than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / d@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ;
all parts of the command must be written in line . the data will be enabled as standard definition .
the language edition Dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service , all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications provides a standard interface for language versions . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently used in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language versions .
since setting the language course only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must not use as language as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; released when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need to use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for voice generators ) , but depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak , text by the computer , which can be saved by the computer . it is already saved as a list of pro@@ xy ph@@ r@@ ases that users can always be rest@@ ore again .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language edition system from &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of modules on that of any application that allows to specify the text by the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a partial system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice edition ( TT@@ S ) . a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; program@@ mer are ready to be equipped with TT@@ S abilities . also the user offers interesting options .
Read text of texts ( or parts of them ) in text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications embedded .
the language edition is done via the Spe@@ ech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses different background program such as the peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with Shell script ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ SM@@ L ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

if k@@ d@@ sm@@ gr is finished , running &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field can activ@@ ate the field edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if the C@@ ruc@@ ture marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears in the system range of the control panel , dis@@ appears to be completed once again .
with the buttons in this series you can start text , starting and go back again .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board and can open a text file to read the speaker for an order .
click to use or OK , then all changed settings on all sides .
the card entries will be displayed only if K@@ TT@@ SD has been started to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card card for General and cross the language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if you can read the text , read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time you should start the language edition .
it is almost always mean@@ ing@@ ful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tensi@@ oner and other un@@ visible brands .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the expanded text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text file . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . marking the text which will be read , and select the language menu . then should select the language edition .
this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ;
K@@ Not@@ ify is the Message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can be not@@ ified about you to read the text of this messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; K@@ DE ; you can find various kinds of messages . you can be not@@ ified if you come in a IR@@ C channel , in which your Nick@@ name is coming . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can read the IR@@ C news for the IR@@ C news .
supports an &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears a menu entry in the menu settings like this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify is di@@ ffer according to application .
filter to the character sets offer good opportunity to correc@@ ted . the file c@@ assette ; belongs to the ship@@ ment of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you will find the tags br and b out of the news , and also the expression / local / in@@ box because this in most cases can be accepted as required .
filters are one of the advanced sk@@ ills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , before he sent to the program Spe@@ ech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for impro@@ ving words or short@@ ened words , select a matching language and speaker to choose between voice synth@@ esi@@ ons and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different types of texts .
the screen Read@@ ers read the highest priority . it will be read the highest priority . if the issue of screen reader is read , the contrac@@ ted orders will be continued again .
warning have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets to hot reserved . a warning has priority , and holds the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be res@@ umed after the issue of warning .
News the next priority . a message und@@ breaking normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that welcome messages . during you &amp; eg ; you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone pleased to welcome you the space . &amp; K@@ DE ; messages are also news . Read More .
the rest are simple text y@@ ields . each job , which is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text applications . text boxes are intended for the edition of pro@@ long@@ ed texts that have no particular un@@ conditi@@ onal .
all four order cards are processed in waiting list , except for the issue of screen Read@@ ers . if a application form the output of a screen Read@@ ers , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such as read , this edition will be completed and finished .
first you must know that filters never be applied to the output of screen Read@@ ers . they are applied to normal war@@ n@@ ings , messages and text presentations and on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages .
filters work the text and give him to the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filter are executed as modules . in the future it can still give more types of filters .
character string trans@@ lat@@ ors replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as a words or as a regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is used with pre@@ defined drawing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; or &amp; k@@ mail in a better shape .
&amp; XML ; -@@ converter use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with microphone selection filter , you can send the text by text or dependent on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you want to read a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages in addition to read it .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules for which he is used for a voice edition . if the filter is not applicable , if the filter is not applicable , the text remains unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; messages sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters , which was set up on the page below . the processing is carried out in the order in the list above the top .
this shows the list of pitches for normal filters . it is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be down@@ wards from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . choose the type of filters out , and it will be displayed below the following entry di@@ alog@@ ues .
for the setup of character translation , you need a list of words or regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . they are found in text in text , then the text is ex@@ changed with the corresponding subst@@ text .
enter your filters a name . this name allows you to choose any name , he must be distingu@@ ished only from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . the filter equ@@ ates the text with the string quartet in the column of the column and replaced it in accordance with the string . the list is shown in the displayed order from above to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular ex@@ pres@@ sions from a file to store the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
is here a language , the filter will be used only when the speaker for the text order a given in the list . click on button to select a list of languages . you can also choose multiple languages when you press the mouse click on &amp; Ctr@@ l ; key .
if a value is registered , the filters will be used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately through comm@@ ata . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the user @-@ ID running programmes can be used with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be away . if example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user @-@ ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to run only .
the default translation filter will only be applied to the text , when all conditions with an entry in the case Di@@ esen Filter is required when all conditions is empty , the filter will be used on all texts .
in comparison of words , the default translation filter for regular ex@@ pres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . the words must be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces characters ) .
in this manual you will find any guide to writing regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; Phone &amp; # 160 ; Phone &amp; # 160 ; Phone &amp; # 160 ; Phone &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; ex@@ pres@@ sions are found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ mit to replace and XML ; using X@@ SLT @-@ files from a format in a different format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . it can only be installed on your system . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the Path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable speed range is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the microphone selection filter , you can set the text to a certain arr@@ ator , which can be set on a speaker with certain features . you can read that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter , is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected to write the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text to the subject @-@ card speaker . with the microphone selection filter , you can write the selected n@@ arr@@ ator .
if the value is registered , the filter is used , if the text is applied on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call this with a click on button to get the help of the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to ver@@ ify the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of your desired radi@@ ators . if the text is selected , the speaker will be selected to show the desired requirements on the same way . click on button right to show the dialog box selection .
to use these buttons to store your microphone settings or upload all settings .
the microphone filter filter will only be applied to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the case Di@@ esen Ap@@ ply filter will need to be at least a condition .
the language API is used by &amp; K@@ DE ; which can be communic@@ ating with programm@@ ers TT@@ S abilities . applications communic@@ ate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , using the voice synth@@ esizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this syn@@ th .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of language edition API by &amp; K@@ DE ; . the complete documentation for both API@@ s will find on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / in bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
it is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you specify

before you &apos;re using &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first if Spe@@ ech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher works with your voice synth@@ esizer , you can use the SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program of Spe@@ ech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher is used so that the device of Spe@@ ech dis@@ pat@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken in single sent@@ ences . the user can go back or cut off , repeat the output or break .
if a application text is available on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you want to set the properties of the preferred speakers for the output . if you want a speaker , this is used , otherwise you will find out the best matching speaker . if you want more , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker chosen , see you in after .
if you click on the card subject to add a speaker to add or on the list , the card subject can be displayed . as an example , please find the setup of the module for festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules which are set up into your system . most of these are not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out the device in dou@@ bt choose a standard .
on this cardboard card you can show special actions that will always be executed when the text book is interru@@ pted by a message with high priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language applications :
the screen Read@@ ers read the highest priority . it will be read with all other applications and maint@@ ains these orders . after the output of the screen reader , the re@@ structuring was recorded again .
warning have the next priority . these stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor gets to hot reserved . a warning keeps out the edition of messages and normal text . these orders will be res@@ umed after the previous warning .
messages received the next priority . a message und@@ breaking normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that can read the news on a web site , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless want to welcome someone &apos;s room .
if a text book is interru@@ pted by a message , warning or the edition of a screen Read@@ ers , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; audio edition to the waiting time .
this audio file will always be played , if a normal text order is interru@@ pted when both introduc@@ tory sound are active , the introduc@@ tory sound of the introduc@@ tory message will be played .
the settings on this cardboard card apply only for normal text boxes . for messages , war@@ n@@ ings and the issues of screen Read@@ ers there is no special actions when these are interru@@ pted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ t ; Not@@ ify messages to read , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click messages . the map not@@ ices appears .
select this check box to read out of &amp; K@@ DE ; messages . this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is marked , messages are played in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
to add these buttons to add the events to add or out . if you want to add to the button , an dialog appears to add the application and the event that you want to list the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; send if someone mentioned in an IR@@ C news on your nick@@ name .
all events that are nothing specified in the list nothing but are ig@@ no@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do it should do if an event exceeds the following selection :
if you have chosen text , enter the desired text , you can use the desired text :
you can enter the features of the required speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker which is shown in the list on cardboard box as top entry . see also .
NOTE that there are three levels for events . it is defined for a certain event of a particular application that is executed . otherwise the action is defined for all the other events of the specific application . as a last possibility the action is set as standard ( all other events ) .
the event all al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . here you can determine the notification of notification , as follows :
use the button save to store the settings for the messages in a file . if you want to load the settings from a file . if you want to start the events with an empty list , click Delete . all entries will be deleted . all articles will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Synth@@ esis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard , to mark text for a voice to mark . this standard includes brands for the control of voices , the speaker of the voice and the pitch for example . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only available in the basic functions . the following restri@@ ctions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) that the standard agre@@ e is used to use the festival edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio @-@ situation in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML @-@ text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ cl@@ ari@@ zation filter ( S@@ DB @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds can be guaranteed , because only the first set are synth@@ esi@@ zed , not the whole text order . so you can jump to the cart@@ oning table or turning , even if the voice synth@@ esizer is not directly supported .
here you can see the stat@@ ut@@ ilisation filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set as a stat@@ ut@@ ilisation filter automatically . you can change its settings or additional stat@@ ut@@ ilisation filters , but it will be demol@@ ished .
the eas@@ i@@ est option to try to check the microphone selection by the microphone selection , which speakers &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose the microphone selection again , change some characteristics and check out how to set the selection of the Interphone selection . it is of course more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start faster with the present , because only the first set will be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long .
you will continue to hold on the cart@@ oning card or read , even if the voice synth@@ esizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal stat@@ utes filter is automatically set up , if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can &apos;t be removed only . change anything in this filter , unless you know what you do .
cross @-@ ad@@ jac@@ ent filter with a regular expression of stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the stat@@ ute character set ( Tab@@ ul@@ al code 8 ) . please note that the standard cross @-@ flow filter can be ret@@ ained .
S@@ b@@ d filter will never be used on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( kn@@ ot@@ ify ) , warning , messages or the output of screen Read@@ ers .
if you have removed the normal cross @-@ flow filter , you can add this again by cli@@ cking the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the cardboard box selection you can over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top @-@ card speaker ) . with other words : there are no microphone properties specified .
use of the matching microphone stations , which shows all properties of a furnished speaker . if you select the settings of the Tal@@ ers or process , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select the speaker which con@@ ferred to the original properties .
select the method for input the desired speaker characteristics by cli@@ cking on one of the selection buttons .
choose the features of the required speaker . if this property does not play no role , give it nothing .
select this check box when the feature rank before other properties . you can also put several mark@@ ings here .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; that enables the management of network interfaces , the rout@@ ine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop adjust@@ ments over a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; called ..
the &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network setting in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; displayed . the module network settings ( kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by sel@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers have already function@@ ally installed and configured also to con@@ figure &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the device is ready and setting the network features .
in most cases drivers are added to install the network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnishings . network devices later , the driver must be loaded by the following files to be loaded according to the kernel version , :
the module network settings is loaded when the optional network settings will be selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; -@@ Index selected . during the types of the module network settings , select the platform to be automatically det@@ ect automatically .
if the platform is not detected , the platform is offered by the list , the distribution and the release of the list is best . due to mark the default setting , the definition can be taken perman@@ ently . at the next start of the network settings will be set automatically preset .
the change of network settings can only be viewed in the system administr@@ ator mode . in advance , all options are not possible to be considered , changing settings are not possible . in the system administr@@ ator mode on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary input of the password required .
in the system administr@@ ator mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three Reiter :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces can be carried out :
the settings on indicated network interfaces can be set by sel@@ ecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog device .
default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button extension settings shows the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection , the TCP / IP system settings are supported by a DH@@ CP Server or BOO@@ TP servers . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP servers can be required . in the evaluation process , there is no further setting . in the selection list may be selected either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , accordingly to the system .
with selection Manu@@ ell , without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP address , the required TCP / IP address should be specified . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , initi@@ alized the system the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not chosen , this option should not be activated .
the values are displayed in this dialog as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be sure that the IP address is not used in the network . the input of a already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP @-@ conflict . using ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine the desired address already in dou@@ bt , the network administr@@ ator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on demand or switched off . limitation by a selection from the list and click interface can be activated ....
network devices can be activated or switched on demand or switched off . off @-@ off of an activated network access by sel@@ ecting from the list and click interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the calcul@@ ator in local sub@@ net , who used the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with data in other sub@@ sid@@ ers .
if the computer has more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer is only IP addresses . if the computer h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is required , the DNS address like about 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.90 .
the calcul@@ ates to the name is part of the riding name resolution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be removed from selection of entries and added or down@@ gr@@ ading in the list with buttons or down in the priority .
by cli@@ cking the button , add a DNS server to add a DNS server . it will add a DNS server . it will be the dialog for New Nam@@ es@@ ver .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name , select one entry and then click on the button .... It is now displayed on the dialog .
the list of nam@@ ely known calcul@@ ates computer @-@ to IP address application for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is available primarily associated with boats if not included DNS servers . in small , enclosed network drives it can replace it DNS servers .
usually the list of nam@@ ely known computers are some entries to support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . these are still in the test of IP should replace the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well known computer and click on adding ... The dialog New also released .
enter the name of the familiar computer and enter the button . when the known calcul@@ ator has several also known as @-@ names , de Knopf Add several times and enter the additional also known as names .
choose one entry of the well known b@@ ugs from the list and select Be@@ ing .... The dialog En@@ forced Calcul@@ ators .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then the list of static hosts will be updated .
in the module network settings , the settings are not effective immediately . in order to activ@@ ate the changes in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf is h@@ tt@@ p : / / kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the newest version of the source texts .

the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool can be used .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; not , but in addition , the developers were required with libraries , and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . it &apos;s not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should be .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this range can not replace more knowledge via IP networks . in this app@@ endix for basic information on the integration of the PCs in a small ( home - ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 is expected to be found in near future . this description are foc@@ used on the wides@@ pre@@ ad IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign network drives , the network administr@@ ator is to be able to be a valid IP address , or if the IP address can &apos;t be selected any IP address .
when using a separate small ( home ) , the IP address should be chosen from a specially for this purpose , to avoid IP @-@ add@@ ressing using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet in the internet .
of course , the access can access to the Internet for such machines using a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , the addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the network mask usually issued on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 that all calcul@@ ators are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things reserved , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP recovery .
the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works as a closed circle .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a safe program for belt works on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create several archives on a band . the development of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ t@@ ar is used to create a surface for t@@ ar to create a question that my wife took me : how much longer lasts it if necessary ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat . this may happen to three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; c@@ ult the band returns and reads the prest@@ ressing of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ach on the band will not be asked if the band form@@ att@@ ed .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; seek the prec@@ urs@@ ement , looking for the matching index on your plate . can be asked if the band index will be created .
if everything is smooth , changes the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band has been installed . in the status bar appears a corresponding message . the contents of the band can now be se@@ ar@@ ches for the band .
in front of the strip , it must first be replaced by the binding . there are three methods to do this to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of symbol for the band , so the binding for the band was sol@@ ved and shows a corresponding message . the band can now be thro@@ wn without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed from &amp; k@@ dat .
a belt needs to be form@@ att@@ ed before you can form as a tape before using &amp; k@@ dat . this process is necessary , before you need to form@@ att@@ ed the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; the flo@@ ppy belt drive could not be form@@ att@@ ed to play DA@@ T drives .
after ent@@ ering the band called and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form of band@@ es . all data on the band is lost automatically ! after completion of the format will automatically be bound and is ready to use .
before you specify the backup process , you need to select the file files that can be made on three types :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only secure this file or the folder .
select a f@@ ault profile in the tree . it will only secured the files given in the profile .
select files in local file tree with a ports . only the selected files and / or sub@@ ordin@@ ates are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu ...
as soon as the backup was re@@ directed , the dialog for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files and settings for the backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog for the dialog . the dialog shows the progress of the safety process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the record for the drive . it will only checked the selected file or the folders .
select files in one of the files in the record for the band with a bun@@ ches . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ ordin@@ ation .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the men@@ entry test ....
as soon as the test procedure was launched , the dialog for check . in this dialogue you can check your choice and check the working positions for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for check@@ ing the dialog , the dialog shows the progress of the test procedure and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can use the Rec@@ over , you must be recovered files that can be recovered on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archive which belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only be selected the selected file or the sub@@ ordin@@ ner .
select the desired files from one of the archives . it will only be recovered files and / or Unter@@ ord@@ ner .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archive and choose the menu ...
as soon as the Rec@@ over the Rec@@ over , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialogue you can check your selection and the working folder for the rest@@ ore .

sometimes it has been necessary to create band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the band@@ in@@ hal@@ tes . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of band :
here is an connection profile with the just marked files and the default settings . you can take the following settings for an connection profile :
the current position was to be done in which the backup should be updated automatically . the list of these files are automatically updated automatically .
for all folders that are listed under backup files that are only concern@@ ed in the same file system , like the folder . folders that can be set to other file systems for 1 . each entry is regard@@ less of the others regard@@ less of the other .
perform a ink@@ re@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last ink@@ re@@ mental file , a sn@@ ap@@ shot file will only be secured that has been changed since .
the name of file , which uses the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment of the last ink@@ n@@ ment backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ ap@@ shot file in front of the call of t@@ ar . this means that all files are protected and a new sn@@ ap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can take up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings , you can take the following settings :
the full path to the device driver for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must have to prove the non @-@ re@@ winding resistance of the band .
if this setting is active , sur@@ ve@@ al &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape , the command is load to the drive . in some hard drives is necessary , before read or writing operations .
is enabled , the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the design at tape drive . maybe this setting not work at all band@@ ages .
if the option is switched on , when trig@@ gering the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the tape . use this option does not use the flo@@ ppy stre@@ aming .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware error sizes for the tape drive . not all drives support variable record@@ ers . No matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to test the block@@ size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , writing a file to the beginning of the band . this file would be just a memory block on the band . the contents of the file is as follows :
( N Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character sequence is the name &apos;s format : seconds , wher@@ eby it form@@ att@@ ed the entire name of the system , which has been form@@ att@@ ed since the ep@@ och in the time since the ep@@ och .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ archive that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not able to use ink@@ able f@@ uses .
check the contents of a safety band . this icon is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system prot@@ oc@@ olle . the program is for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to perform the various protocol files . Moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experience the fast access to information on problems that appear on their servers .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computers in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users ; the program is for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can find information on your system or where the system con@@ sid@@ ers the various protocol files .
Moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experience system@@ log ; experience the fast access to information about problems that provide on their servers . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some extended functions , with their help the protocol files certain programs and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 offers &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sys@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features include also include and will be explained in other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file is easily fil@@ tering and sort the individual ways to sort and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ oc@@ oll has started . the protocol files are usually started using Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal users don &apos;t have any auth@@ orization to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar in order to fit selected filters . in the default setting , the selection box will be displayed automatically , so the protocol line will only be displayed , if in one of the columns the string , the options of the filter search options are included .
you can choose to select another entry in this place , select one another entry in the protocol file system prot@@ ok@@ oll will select the column process , and carry out in the filter bar the names of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recogni@@ ze the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors will be displayed with a minimum statement as a protocol lines . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ oc@@ oll or in C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can still be useful if you want to check the output of a specific command as for example for the launch of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , you want to use filter bar .
furthermore , you can activ@@ ate the option to view the new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all the latest protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ star . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open an additional sub @-@ window , select the menu for the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a own website on h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ s@@ oftw@@ are@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you will find more information on the reference from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; do .
the system V in@@ it develops up to the standard for control of program starts at the high @-@ drive system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore because it is easier to use , powerful and flexible more flexible as the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not return on the Historical Asp@@ ects ( e.g. because I do not know about it knows : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is therefore important , because perhaps one could try to record one machine on system V in@@ it , without any re@@ installation and re@@ form@@ al . why do you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the Sys@@ V in@@ it diff@@ ers from BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ ordin@@ ances of / etc are used directly in / etc . this file called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional file :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scri@@ pts . bas@@ ically you need a script for any system service that you want to run on another run@@ level . system services do not such things like network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , h@@ tt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not such things like set@@ serial , which will only be started once again . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there are not much use for this file , you can do not want to do something like to do something like to do what with the serial connection .
the kernel is search@@ ing for different places after the program in@@ it , and starts the first that he takes place .
the stand@@ ar@@ est run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see the following line as follows :
at this point you can design a look into the second column and probably that you would like to perform it / etc / in@@ itt@@ from by hand , then you can repair all of your hand , then you can repair all of the system , then you will repair all the system rest@@ art the system and then exec@@ ute the system :
but how does it get all the right sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te ? if you enter -@@ l enter r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that the folder doesn &apos;t have any correct files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scri@@ pts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it work and stops all system services ? very simple : each of Sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te is thus written , that it acc@@ epts a arg@@ ument like start and stop . you can start this script of hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the names , and if the one includes a K , the script will be called with the arg@@ ument stop , the script will be called with the arg@@ ument .
some people wish you to set a simple way , machines for many purposes ; I could run only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; you can run even a user -@@ Run@@ level , das &amp; etc ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; . it should not difficult to be very difficult because the program is done as an friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another z@@ ei@@ ge@@ ster is easy to say tri@@ vi@@ al : draw a entry from the av@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or to stop ) .
you can change sk@@ ri@@ p@@ te also between Run@@ lev@@ elling or the position within one levels when they go wo@@ unded . this is the entry of its original run@@ level ( or his position ) , but this happens if they move an entry from the available system services .
NOTE : how to copy these in a new zone when you want to copy these in a new run@@ level , you need to choose copy from the menu or from the context menu and even in the target range insertion -- even then if the same entry already exists in the target range of action .
the sor@@ row &apos;s number is sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to use the sorting numbers of the converted entries before you can try to use the system service .
NOTE : there is no option to rest@@ ore the entries that were thro@@ wn into the paper bin . be so in@@ sured .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator -@@ button to activ@@ ate the various working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ urs@@ or buttons to make a choice of top@@ - or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and add him in the desired round level with insertion ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row or the name of a clo@@ cking or the name button to open the dialog box to accept the dialog box to accept the dialog button to accept the modi@@ fications to accept the amend@@ ments to accept the amend@@ ments to accept the amend@@ ments to accept the amend@@ ments to accept the amend@@ ments .
due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu click a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc . Pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc ) , if it is available . otherwise they are produced by &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; played by the pres@@ ets are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ rc .
I have been experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ elling , and now starts the machine to new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO @-@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then you will work the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level on a s@@ ensi@@ ble value ( 3 should be normally in order ) .
I have some system services using &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or D@@ ye ( DL@@ D ) then you need to work additional files in / etc , which are only available in this distribution . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , like system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propri@@ etary integration programmes of this distribution , but unfortunately , but is a standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; planning an extension of this approach to this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are needed ( and also whether they are needed in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) just make sure your configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varied from distribution can be different from version to version different . if you want to use a different distribution , please send us more information about the run@@ level to be access@@ ed this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have taken changes , you have to save this saving . either use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or the entry saving in the menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user list . select the desired users or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user - or group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have expanded system settings . only if you need to exec@@ ute a card card , if Shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d such as BSD @-@ Uni@@ x@@ en are installed .
the card item is released , otherwise Shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d such as BSD -@@ Uni@@ x@@ en are installed .
this cardboard card will be activated only if for at least one @-@ und@@ ated fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognition at the file rati@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can be changed for each user parameters where the space restri@@ ctions can be changed in KB :
this parameter can be set separately for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of file system with space restri@@ ction .
the Map @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group of selected user . the standard group that belongs to the users , you can find in the field of prime group . continue to mark the user in other groups by cli@@ cking these in the large field .
the dialog for the Group contains a list of all users to add a user to add this user in the list .
to add a user or to add a group , select the menu user or group or click on matching the matching button button . the Edit or del@@ eting the selected user and the selected group will work with analogue .
using this module you can add the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove the boot password , remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove standard operating system , remove , changing systems , changing , and more .
