<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? well, to do you want to do your metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you can select all the photos that you need all the images that you need all the images that you will select the same attribute, and then you will start the best with the ranking or the ranking. this makes sense that you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now proceed with keywords, as you like to continue with other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonymes for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you need to import images from a different source with embedded sample, then you will find the images to the right place. the change of Hierarchy is no problem and can easily be able to move through the tree of a underway. the changed key words are pursued by & digikam; updated during it the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows like different metadata. this is a very grobe Representation, since every block of metadata in truth from many sections. filename and calendar dates to all photos.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section relates to damages or comments on the third important tool for your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to see most of your photos, you want to see you with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are securely interested in your photos.</seg>

<seg id="172">Author (synonym for inventories and author): this field should be used to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. if it is not desired, the name of a company or organisation must not be changed. this field supports neither Commas nor Semikolons as a separating character.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (Synonym for author): linked with the author. this field contains the study designation of the photographer, volunteer photographer, volunteer photographers, or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the author feld, this also has to be filled with this.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (Synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify the photograph or Associated Press, then the image has to be listed here if the image has been here. if the image has a bearing photo, then here the group / agency will be given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections. each of these no protection against abuse, delete or change. the solution for this problem is a little watermark. for private individuals, this is intended for those of your photos only by low interest. for professionals and half-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is one of the first time. & digi am; it is available in the near future a module for stacking processing.</seg>

<seg id="178">We did not talk about CDs die on the street or fire. this type of losses are the same as well as traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is possible to have problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data restore company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to get them more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archived quality. there are offers about Gold Coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that can claim a life time of 100 years for themselves. if you believe in your choice.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you can use good disks and good notes as the cheapest type, but you can write much truce. it turns out to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very andue for error, even if you just have just written only. they are just effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the control summing. despite this massive protection, it is required for the formatening and the control cabinet. despite this massive protection, ultrasettes light, crater, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called Iso Buster it works well as CDs and DVDs; but is still not for Macs available. there are also similar applications to damaged hard disks, hard disks, Flashmedia, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disc seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD to win almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything is said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn with a good capture device in a non-proprietary media in one non-proprietary files. don't forget the data to the next generation of media, you don't forget the data to the next generation of media or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">A disk manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer properties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a great field study about the bug Mechanisms of hard drives: Diskferstudas</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: displaying at the longest if you are operated in the Temperate range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C, the most common error occurred. this is the most common error occurred. these are particularly reading and publishing meter. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just a complete losses due to overvoltage of over voltage. you can also secured data loss due to a power failure before you can eventually produce the files without a big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">Whereas most electrical devices current size does not take much to make devices with computer chips and high-speed processes, complete motherboards, Hardwarehouses, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect himself up to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most common protection against power tips is a overload protection. this is a device that is absorbing a part of energy saving is absorbed and the rest is normally in the form of a slot bar. remember that any connector strip also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should also meet the UL 1449 standard. this ensures that it offers a certain minimum of protection. you should also protects the protection against flash plants and therefore protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because an overvoltage of each cables can be connected to your computer, you should also be protected by telephone lines. this also applies to telephone cables and cable modems. some manufacturers can also include telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overload protection. a variety of these tools are especially designed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. it's ideal for the way.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overload protection of your system is not really help. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unspecified data. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltages, these devices may automatically move into consideration up to the power. if you want to use your data to the power. if you have a UPS to be sure that they might be the same quality requirements like a overload protection. furthermore, the life-time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">If you have chosen the potential risk, which your computer system is set up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can you need for less than & euro; 20. this is just a smaller price difference if you should remember the computer. finally, you should always think any cable to trenne before you drive into your holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with any quantities.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive to home, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore just as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it's not a bad solution but it's not a general safety solution. this is it too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo Community 23hq.com is available online store on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB, in the case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage that should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the view of the data backup, the web solutions are highly secure. transfer error will automatically adjusted automatically and to the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are possible for transfer error. the file system is at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has never noticed if a transfer error occurred. all these disorders will remain unquiet until you would have thought on any day. No one seems to have thought that it seems to have thought on the internet with his TCP protocol. it is much more safe data way than the computer in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source for transmissions, since they generate interval within the data flow. during normal data systems, this error is unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently affected by transmission problems, you should see in the future. for 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems appears one of two candidates and highly scalable. it's open source, with many patents and is available under one for GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only be available for & Linux; and Windows available. Read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started a own initiative with his btrfs file system. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanism the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not estimate these two factors for 86% of the data loss in the Notebook and 46% of the work systems for notebooks, the share of densities are 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the mastering. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux; it has been no longer assured.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less preparatory for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, travel fs, JFS and XFS, to call the widespread file systems. a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the trial period during an operation is higher and a undefined status, but if a file is not completely stored before the problem, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat for digital data: false, theft and human error, the main cause for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 flashing settings from fundamental physical limits. it is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and volume characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in direction of the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optimally for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have the limit of 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you can receive today for 100 & euro; so do not require any data loss for data loss. secure your data is affected by any data loss as the reinstallation of your operating system, change the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, one day, a flash, you're lucky enough if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A Desaster proposes local and destroys a lot. forget the airplane: fire, water, electricity, children and poebble are dangerous enough. they usually enter a whole room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desastervors always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses the steps up to the neighbours, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above, is a common reason for a loss of the panic. if you have a backup, but if you have a backup, then you can save the day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a moment without Historie and presents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Assurance: one backup of the files which has been changed since the last complete control. creates a complete torque recording at two time points: the complete control and the last differential fuse.</seg>
<seg id="222">Inkremental securing: one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. once again we produce the original status at any time. this fuse comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is not ongoing - not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool you can easily evaluate your machines. in contrast to the script controlled FTP or other types of file transfer encodings. this happens to the difference of the files. this happens, and if you want to increase the security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure your important pictures directly after you have saved on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach can be enough to discover the time to discover losses and again. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moments for each month. every additional information should be done manual, after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, associated with files stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, associated with images and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewers,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will surprise the next 40 years, because they are really interested in you are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future due to your nature is unpredictable, you will consider everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to vote at the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to vote as the current system backward. however, less variations in the past, it is so easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that your paintings are important, then store it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other side the Council is quite easy: anytime if you want to change your computer architecture, your memory and fuses technology, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist for the possibility to change one system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out of it that you want to set the scalability, and the range you want to put up on a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer to a new plate.</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg if your new plate has been recognized from the system, but it is not one.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC, the new plate is / dev / SDC, the new plate is / dev / SDC and the size of the panel in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # changing the size of travel if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if any day does not read more software, then you can create this job. this task is easier to simpler for year too.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary format which disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was an open source standard developed as an open source standard, but it is much more. it is losing, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many administration formats, but not as many as TIFF are needed and a slow compress. this format want to store you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as a picture format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss of compression algorithm. there is a problem that this format may be adapted in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives format is a license-free and open RAW format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is now available on the basis of metadata. it is now available on the basis of metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competition Canon and Nikon it even sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001, Adobe its XML based XMP technology, which allows users to replace the '90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. the file information are stored in a file. file information is stored with extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers in front of your photo, mostly in the raw format which saves the metadata separately from the image file, and the image file will come from the image file and the image file will cover the raw format. therefore you should consider if you want to use as container and everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation that support for fully compatible online metadatenstandards, discussions and cultural work in the DCMI production groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and competitions to achieve a wide acceptance of metadatenstandards and interns.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the images are using the camera system, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save this in your repository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine treatment you can use external programs. if you work the pictures again with & digm; then you should add the metadata. these were cut off among the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protecting the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, encoding in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digm; in the passage of a record you can add a description as you can add you to your hard disk, you can add many advanced settings for importing images to your album files.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digm; use this with the computer, activate the camera on the indicating mode and switch them. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it is trying to appear with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig-Indicator is available. if this is the case, the filename, and a symbol for any file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you need to view the camera formations on each entry. with the sliding properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a details or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows the file properties and the photo information related to the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not downloaded from the camera. please note that at some digital cameras not all information are available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's notice, GPS etc. the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikon; or the image processing. please note that the metadata could not be available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computers, the click on the button and then select the selection of all camera in a single album in & digm;. Download the pictures will be downloaded from your camera to be downloaded in a album before you will delete the pictures from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection methods of & KDE; please choose the button download and then selection Selected. the knob Selected is long as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is it supported, is an option of new download. these pictures were not yet available for download. if you want to select the new pictures with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to select the buttons, select a dialog that will be displayed in the photos. the list of existing albums will be displayed, as usual folder, displayed. details for Ordnersorate you can read the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digi; invites the pictures from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos, you can delete this from the camera. you can delete all of the camera. if you want to delete the button. if you want to select some delete, you need to select this first and delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">NOTE that there is no possibility to recover from the camera that you will be deleted from the camera. you should be fully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to remove the camera battery. if you want to make the camera shooting, because this is much faster than the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filenames for the photos are not exceptionally exceptionally well. these can be added to the same album. so it can be meaningful to integrate the date and time to integrate the picture in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for date based underlines. if you are using this latter option, will automatically be created automatically a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer opens three more options that are done before the author in the Section Standard Autorientity. if you select the relevant entries from the exif information in the IPTC fields. using the last option you can finish the date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different file format as the default format, you can use e.g. in the processing field the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% S. switch the option date & time. for additional adjustments should read the help of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you want to use the camera file names, you have the possibility to change the file names in lowercase. or in large case, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, used & digm; for a photo, will be displayed below the name, the camera is stored in the preview. your settings will be stored and automatically when you can open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digi on; can all information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic turning during the downloading. not all cameras are ready for information on the camera bar. in the section page row Metadata you can read more details on the information which has embedded camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera is not enabled, and digicam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic turning off, use button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is made more information on the date, to the photo taken, & digm can be downloaded on the image data. all images with the same date. do not hesitate to read these information. in the section page of Meta Data, you can read more information about your camera in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, the photos can switch directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need this option. use the button extension based on the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way photos of your computer to load their camera is Download. choose the file selection dialog & KDE; appears to select the files that you can select the files that you can select more than a file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection, asks & digicam; you, where the pictures will be loaded up. please select the desired folders and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position to be displayed in length and latitude. the determination of data can be done by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photo prints, it is interesting to link a picture with more precise-geographical place. not everyone is an aircraft by automatic recording of the GPS data to kartografires. environmental planner, military, police, architecture office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you don't forget the picture where you want to open a browser that you can find a postcard to another & digi; users can send the place of the photos, or simply only these aspect ratios, it is good about the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the image? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitineraries and map references. the question is so much more, how the data processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI Module for the geographical information (manual) and the latest manual transmission of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">If we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit. but there is a few that can work with GPS receivers. either as map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">The download of GPS data from one device can store with gpsone or gpsbabel. you need to store these data in the gpx format, because this is the only format is supported by the geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are more different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from pictures and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitude or other data, you can use these scripts that works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign of coordinates that use maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire by & digm on this page can be switched on this page. if you have switched on this page. if you have enabled, different sizes and synchronized mode is not available. if you have one of the picture screen saver; you should only use only on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better view.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default the image processing of a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer another color, you can select this here. you can use the toolbar when you can use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over and underexposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing can be set up here with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is common that the images in a higher resolution of the luminance is encoded as in the Farbinocations. please read this article in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG files you can reduce the size of PNG files to reduce the image quality, as PNG a lost-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can use this value to a high compression ratio. it means 1: a low and 9 compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option of TIFF files, you can switch the deflate algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it is no influence on the image quality, since the deflate algorithm lost.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting-free JPEG 2000 files you can choose to store the ratio between quality loss and file size far better than the normal JPEG. as this paragraph was not supported, but metadata was not supported in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digi, the image processing was only a image viewer for photos. currently there is very fast to a tool to manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all the green pixels of the CCD sensor is expressed as the pixels of unloading lines. if you need this option to solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option is the picture a little soft, eliminated the 2x2 circle pattern with the VNG or the AHD quality methode.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used. otherwise, if the automatic shbalance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is it possible to use a solid color balance, which is based on a white map in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that get the popular images in four steps more details in the top lights. for other cameras, it will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the nickname, so the parts of your images are burned down to consider as a continuous white in the settings. to set the setting in various roses. last, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the poems.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixel are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw are therefore the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option you will select the possibility to set a level of three a compromise and can be adjusted separately for every image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Use the luminance value after your taste. you must set him something higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of & digi; -image processing. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should consume you.</seg>
<seg id="309">An Demosaicing -algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the color image sensor that provides many cameras and the matrix colored pixel are also available as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digm at your disposal: Bildear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of Gradients) was the first algorithm of the Dcraw material. he creates colour artefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting when you are a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils, you can find Rot- and Blue corrections values here. this is surely the best method for a soft correction which is performed during the resource conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the Farbinocations and returns to these again. there are also LCMS and & digicam; information such as Farbinocations of one color space in the others are thus possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour issues if a picture in the image processing is opened / colour administrator module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile file sharing here the folder, like e.g. / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you want to save all your profiles. & digi; examines these folders during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Here you have the option of the ICC profiles here are the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color restriction view is an alternative to XHb or Argyll. here only your paintings are unfolded to the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturer and Modell. there are some profiles that contain any color mapping or gamble correction. currently corrects dcraw Gamma not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform paint mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options as the soft-Proof profile, which allows you to figure out what your printer can be back on your camera as your printer can be better than your camera and some colors are very saturated. this might be manually corrected, instead of the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obviously, the color profile for them is why not intended for the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiling them. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension allows the style to recognize the style: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitund S for the standard style.</seg>

<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filtering the keywords, the keywords and a selection box with the previously used in this & digam; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The subject tree is adapted to the given search word. you can check out the number of possibilities in search for a keyword fast. this ability is particularly useful when you have many jaws.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief on the input of a picture series. if you have different filwords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Similarly, the keywords can also be set within the tree. all the keywords of a picture will be stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view, and you select a keyword in the keywords, this is not only on the highlighted picture, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The toolbar feeder filter is used to change the selection of the main window images with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views are used as additionally as one or more keyword filter from the right hand, only the cutting quantity of these two works are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also go keywords and put it. if the keyword already exists, you can pull it with stiffer. if the keyword already exists, you can find it from the right side strip, and put it to the choice when you are asked if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is available on three pictures. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then there was a keyword from the right hand tree to the choice and there was a dialogue, whether this keyword will be placed.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will be held at every start of the program. you can also be switched on settings of different settings.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you have a colourful workflow in the colors of your camera or scanners, you can reach a predictable deviation from your camera or scanners, the colors are printed on your camera or scanners same as well as the colors are the colors or in the web pages of your digital dark-chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme of color administration is, then any knowledge is to set up for the results. the sense of this tutorials it has to be adequate background information about colour administration. in addition, you should get your links with deeptive decisions to meet your own informational decisions to meet the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow will be fulfilled all six bottom, then you must not take care of color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work at a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other pictures are by e-mail or web, where sRGB of the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is good works and life for all that simple, why should you do another color space which do you need to do beyond colour manor?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limit of sRGB compared to the colors which we can see below. it shows a 2 dimensional display of all colors, which we can see the hufeisenular region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional presentation of sRGB with some greater colour space, you visit Bruce Lindblooms recognize page and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to work my monitor with my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you want to work in the snian color space or not, you need to work your monitor. if you need to use your monitor. if you need to use your monitor to the sRGB standard, you need either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, a matching monitors or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections available to improve the picture in most cases. use it before you can attempting a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, dispensing, automatic and contrast from the menu corrected automatic correction are automatically emented automatically from your colors the best. you will need to see the best effects on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the leustrongest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without shady rest. this function is often a magic correction for images the dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">In the same way: this method adjusted the illuminated colors of the colors of the selected image. sometimes the same number of pixels that thus produces very good results with the improvement of the conformity of an image, sometimes it produces only litter. it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles with a picture or it destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic copy: this method maximizing the color area in the Rot-, green and bluechannel. you have been determined the dark and bright marginal and bright border to the complete history.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the move of the lowest and highest values of all values between. this is only visible by balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digm; is a semiautomatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited to about an color space with 8-bit per color. if you can perform a white balance within the raw mode, if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which allows for correction to correction better than 16 bit mode.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it over the menu entry white balance of white balance.</seg>
<seg id="397">The advance window can be adjusted in the size. on the left side are adapted to see the preview of the goal. if you want to see the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original version, then it is to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target company has a red markers. the luminance of the Pixels below this markers will be displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is indicated that dynamically modified, once you want to change an parameters. this histogram is very helpful because they can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be shown. the total is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result is depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadows can be adjusted to improve your photos or down dimmen.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above-mentioned controls, should use the color pipette. press the color chart to use this button and then click on this type to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. to this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed aggregate increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels. you will receive the combined results in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and store make this. every setting of the white balance, you can store it into a text file and later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button viewer sets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. please note that your original settings will be changed as your original image. if you want to image your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codidate depth per color channel of the working image. 8-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding are also better for high-quality images. this coding are also suitable for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool gives the same dialogue such as the processing of raw image. it uses the change and the assigning of color profile. color mapping can be carried out by the window for the help of color profile you can draw the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu of colours. this tool allows you to adjust the same way to adjust the same mistake if your camera can make your camera and you always need the same corrected. in the manual for the loudspeaker-correct structure you can find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool to Gradation that you can find under paints and menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digi on; tool colour effects provides you four colors effects, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar power, also called Sabatier, a effect of the color, a effect of the color, the color, dark areas were eliminated by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatives of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity shows the picture what chemically is possible. a further increase was finally reproduce a negative image that is not to produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect from the colours. try it simple, he is beautiful many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a daylight optimized color film by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for his smooth picture structure. Velvias is strong in different colors, but also some photographer, especially those that are hardly landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilters simulates Neonlight on the contrast ratio. the parameters controls the brightness of the results and the arthritis of the Neonlight. in large images, the filters can be loaded the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have commonly resolved problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color code and the luminosity of the photos in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result. as soon as you are satisfied with the result, you can use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you want to get a photo at bad light conditions, you can increase the tool for brightness / saturation. all changes you can perform a good choice when him can be seen in the preview. if him also like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple leukaemia / contrast / Gamma is the tool-value correction for improving the exposure to this tool only require the application of the slider. concrete the three slider below the history below.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a Grape of intensity values, an histogram, the active channel or of the selected section. among the grape are three sliders can be clicked and the top values of the image. the left side is presenting the dark and the right side of the light.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpate the controller and then change it as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can view the original and the preview of the image. the preview will be dynamic, updated with the settings of the image, updated on the left side are the following options.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box may be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is displayed. for pictures of a digital camera is dominated by a constant color. in this case, the linear histogram of a single column is dominated in this case.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for dark sounds, the middle for bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones are called gammaze.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color replacement parts can be used in the preview of the originals of the original shadow, in order to adjust the input of the shadow, medium and bright sounds. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values can be able to specify the selection manual values for any area. they often have to change the output values like the input ranges. the compression of the output can be used as background as background during anything else during the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob, the image values will automatically be set automatically depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and store: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and later again, the Gimp levels are used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you want to use this mode and the three color photos will be automatically adjusted for all shadow, funds and sun ones, and click the preview of the Originale for Rot-, green, Blue and Luminescence.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposed aggregate controls all colour channels to show overexposed pixels, and this is the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, so you get the effect only in the preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example for the alignment of the input values on the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output image has been unchanged (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the originals and the target image displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically in dependence on your settings. on the right hand, the following options available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to connect the channel from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box you have two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures the most linear mode of the meaningful colour produces a wide beam of a wide beam in this case. in this case the logarithmic mode.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that this bright sounds with the dark output values and the corresponding pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see you want to change the right line on the curve, which makes the original value on this line and move this then to the value to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and store: with these buttons you can do exactly that. each curve can be stored in the file system and later, the file format is the Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you build this method and add the control points of the curve for all channels of the attende- and sun ones. activate the color video that you want to use and click the original image to put the control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposed aggregate data will be found to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. Schattenuation and sun ones was set up with the color video. the original image is set at the original image (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digm; image processing is a tool to improve the paint canals or the paint shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can work it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can view the relative distribution and outlay. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen as a comparison to the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the goal of the target contains a red markers. if you see this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram to show you the respective color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction, it is particularly convenient if you want to adjust the respective colour components, as the channel mixer then change the tool to the generation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, if you have been Monochrome, the reduction of a color in a visible noise, which looks like a colour canal, which looks like this case. if the case is like this case you can improve your monochrome conversion to improve the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any popular mixer setting, you can store it for later and then load the user file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposed aggregate controls all colour channels to show overexposed pixels, and this is the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, so you get the effect only in the preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in the Blue channel. the option of Luminance is activated. the original image is activated under (1) and it worked under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your Abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white, can be converted to the computer with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white filtering with a green lens filters. this looks good, at all scene images and fits particularly well to Portraits against the sky. so like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filmed: simulates a black / white filtering with an oral ginsenfiltration. this improves landscapes, -scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white filtering with a red lens filters. this creates dramatic cut-effects and can simulate mouriscised for the daily time. so like the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white filtering with a yellow legenic filter. this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and so similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm and medium tones during a bit of cold in the saddle of a pressure and the development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and so similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">You can use & digi on; tool texture you can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless whether it can look like a painting on a screen that I can look like a painting portrait or as a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used to use the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: slidable of this parameter increases to the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional design of texture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texturing is used on the picture below. the original image has been used (1) and changed under (2). parameter Relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digm; tool box can add a decorative frame to be added in a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the borders of a photos is no light task. a possibility to keep its attention to the picture. this is a psychological Barrier for scattering eye. under the frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set you set the desired type of frame for your image. the picture with a colourful line, niepce corbate it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), abrusted it with a nice three-dimensional design and decorate a decorative frame to the patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of frame in percent. the segment's width is limited to a width of 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than original, but the same aspect ratio will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing of images, especially if you have made the tool after the aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can add one-format text in a picture to any position. this is also possible on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive and use it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics. you will select the character set that you need a frame to select the text and / or a half-transparent background. the image is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting that you have chosen for your text, can be changed to button "OK" after the image once has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">You can use the & digi; tool stencil to apply a stencil to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture stencil to apply in the image processing can be used to put on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. you need to add your stencil to the file format list. who want to add your stencil to the file size in English to the & digikam; mailing list digicam-Users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time you need to put your stencil printer with the button ordner in dialogue. select the folder where you have taken the file files to the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root canal for the templates put a tree view that reflects the Ordnerstrustructure of the stencil printer. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increased the picture below. to ensure the mouse leads to the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Verbs: this knob resized below the picture below. if you want to use the position of the mouse. if you want to use the stencil to the whole picture, you'll need to verify the picture to the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this knob to move the stencil image. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the stencil to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digi am; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you have hiding in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, generated, particularly in dark areas, basketball images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Insight-mask works on the contrast of the edges of a picture. indeed it is no little bit, it works rather psychovisuell. you can do it to remove atmosphere. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three, as he really improves the sharpness. he is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaption.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of the sharpness. these measures that the high resolution are exposed to a common color. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more tolerated than normal cameras for the private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images it is often used in an internal camera. pictures in raw format, always must always be used during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner using a sharpness already during the image of the image. if you deactivate it, check out the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can easily recess results by using a photograph with the sharpening-factory sharpness. you can also call the menu entry for the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should go to this, as the results are not exceeding of course, that the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhancing any further information on the menu entry to the focus. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too sharp. the solution that looks a little soft to draw. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry corrected turnout and experimenting with the menu on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The blurred blurred is a very good tool to remove sanding from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview the preview can help the image. this window indicates the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two key parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate often good results and should first become an increase of the effect or the amount of the effect. if you generate the inspiracy mask to strong, robberate and impression of graves close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixel on each side of the filter are affected. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore buy pictures at the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the spoilt image one of the original, thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a break out of the maximum RGB-value and the difference of the filter. it can be used to use a minimum difference between the fooding of the sharpening of the sharpness and therefore shopurity in mind, heavens and water damage.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the extremely blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the original image die (2). blurred blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digi on; tool focus is a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the urging-fold filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture to & quot; this is better approach as a sharpness. it is used to use a technique called FIR Viennese. it is used to make better results as an extremely sharp mask. you can launch it from the menu by connecting colors reproduction in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice it works much better than the Gauß's fender. the Gauß's fender has a very long tail, which makes the mathematical result of the source pixel, which is far not affected by the original pixels, which is quite strongly affected by the pixels. which causes irresistible results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most images should set the default value for the use of this module. you can use a higher value if your image is extremely blurred, but then your picture should be made on Heiligenschein.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can contribute to the correlation. the correlation can be selected from 0 to 1. Brauchable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation to the correlation effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the volume filter can help you to reduce the image quality. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the volume filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is quite badly. a high value is 0,03. a high value is measured here.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. this is the most common cause you to avoid this value to 0 if you need to use this value to zero, so you might need to increase the correlation and / or the space filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix, especially when you have large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß, if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any number of refocus parameters will be stored for later and then you can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all of cutting, color and intensity setting on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture on the background. the reason for this is that much of the changes did not be visible immediately, but the very pleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; when JPEG, you should use the module on the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Completely blurred blurred blurred result than sharpening. this might be caused by means that the blurred blender a bigger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically seen blurred blurry. even under optimum conditions. even under optimum conditions, it would never show the effect of FIR Viennese filters always at least exactly as good as the inspiration mask. the FIR Viennese filters is frequently better than the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp cheddar image has to be corrected. this image has been done with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is attributed to the Auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods to the sharpness of digital images you can read a technical data in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controls smooths the inspiration of the range of the dark was turned to produce a natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinent enables a adjusted color for the pupil. if you want to adjust the blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool-error correction is one of the most recently developed tool to remove unnecessary artefacts with example.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter Settings, you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a true Glasses about the picture. the value of 0.9 should be so that no sharpness is necessary. please note that the detail-compliance is always be subject to compliance.</seg>
<seg id="520">Excessibility Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothly evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in a direction of smoothly. JPEG Artefacts will generate a high value of the best pattern. JPEG Artefacts will be best at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothly [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor on alles. p then set these values therefore to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. if it is necessary, the larger is required when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect. it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are how often the algorithm is run. usually, is usually 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle between 5, 90]: angle dependant integration of the anisotropes Alpha. if Alpha is a long time, it should be a long run time. you should make this value so as larger and for your needs acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral part size [0,1, 10]: full-stride width in pixels. you should use the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: this option is only low. it doubles but the duration. we recommend it to specify him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and store make this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later recharging it again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image mistakes is comparable very quickly at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you. you can therefore set the calculation with the button break.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see picture error with small artifacts file. this module will be used on a picture that in Guatemala City with an analogous film position during the journey caused by a bad film storage while the original image has caused the original image below (1) and corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digi am; Noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses an ural-based algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image-filters available to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor smooths from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of unique pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor speakers of digital cameras, you can read this in the tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a baseline noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the window details and the sub-windows settings can stay at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the filter per pixel and can be adjusted the picture by the radius and the color in him is smoothed and thus certified smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controlled the sharpness of the filter. if it increases the pixel distance between the filter. if it is high, you'll need to adjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters image details do not receive more and noise or lubricating.</seg>
<seg id="537">Cannon: does the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is powerful, the frequency response of the filter. if it is too heavy, you can't like to lose a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to change an image. these settings are not affected by the smoothing process by the details pane settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the Bilo. we recommend to change either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings does not affect the smoothing process by the details adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark ranges, which typically have faster than to increase, but also the barbed areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the alignment of the phase isolation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of lightening. if it is increased, the edges will appear to occur when he may appear on the edges. it can be smoothed to the edges. it can be smoked and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have to be saved into the file system and later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of what noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2) is characterized by default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a painting for your purpose. the solution that is a little soft to draw, is lucky much easier than a painting to draw and experimenting with the menu entry correcting the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & dignam; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most recently developed tools to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restauration gives you the possibility to remove your photos of your paintings. it is very well adapted to remove your paintings, film, cryatzer, compression resistance and local error. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and will receive the contents as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texts. the algorithm is done with another tool, the algorithm of the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even so far away. as a loss of compression algorithm, - small standards the uncompressed picture to see the uncompressed picture. this setting shall be corrected these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and store make this. each setting of photo restore can be saved in a text file and later again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restore is comparable very quickly at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you. you can therefore terminate the calculation with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below is a picture with a equally-shaped noise, the module is applied on a black and white photo that you can see the original image of 3200 ISO (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the original image of the original image (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see a further example for the photo Restoration. this time, textures was read on an old color photo that caused by the Scannerlighting and the photopapier. the original image has been seen under (1) and corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digam; tool Hotinches allows you to remove hotpixels from photos which were made with a CCD camera to remove eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project which are protected by Martin Dicklop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially in high quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Please download this file in the stassistants with a button dark. the tool is recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the photo show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark-image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark image to correct image. a automatic processing of the dark-size will notice the bad pixels. please note that the assistant to invites you to invites this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview can help you correct within the image of the result. the feeds shows the issue of the filter with the current settings. poor pixel are fixed in all single areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">In order to see the defects pixels on the preview and the results of the Filters. choose the best filter method to interpolating these pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duran: it becomes an average of adjacent pixel. the resulting color is made all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block, to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) to interpolishing the pixels in a block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are deducted to calculate a bi-cubical surface (1-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) to interpolishing the defective pixel on a block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digi am; Vignettification correction is a tool to correct the vigns, i.e. lower corners, one of the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">In particular, in particular & quot; vignettierenquot; (shady) they often reach the corners and edges of the image by clicking the light into the light there. telephoto demonstrates the light into considering this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But also the drawbacks. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the necessary camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be possible with center filter, a opening of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise insically safe effects through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large platinum resistance of today, film and gray-scale ranges of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter to simulate the transformation of a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is copyright protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three artists, you can control the vigns-correction filter and with three additional extermination of the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity setting up to the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2,0, according to an optical filter of 2, in an optical filter to compensate a larger degrees of vignetting to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchmarks, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the vignetizing correction. you need to adjust the target range of these options. the controller provide you only positive values as you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want more sensitive new adjustment of the destination of the target? let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the & digm; image processing from the menu colour Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettification correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vigniting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a Leuchstrengthke- and contrast correction was also done with the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digam; lens is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an uriting algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. coloured distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is treated the general geometric distortion of the lens and the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third quarter has a similar round file, but eight to the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth trades corrected the corners of the corners. if you combine these two combine any geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values can be corrected with negative distortion and positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion. this value is stronger than in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the 'corners has the verify sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the picture size new and leads to a correction of the first degree through negatives values. Negative values enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighments: this value adjusting the brightness in the form of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you will help the best filter Settings, illustrated in the dialog with a preview of distortion correct. the values can be used for your image, and used in the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnet or pillowing correction should be carried out before the cutting or size modifications. the best result will perform this correction than all the first through. if you make a picture new to cut out the effect of the fallow.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you to help the best correction to show this tool. move the mouse button in the picture show to fix the mouse panel in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection you can finish the tonnen- / cold distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected a goat distortion. you can remove the resulting dimensions of black edges. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu of the image processing or over the zoom of this Dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonnenoidal corcorrection. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings it is the perspective as to correct the angle in the image 90 degrees. please note that if you have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tonnet correction on a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduced the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the range for the preview. if you are the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can adjust the file size and film Sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Füge texture. the ISO controller changes the amount of film pieces and the Dominanz of paint green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter size is missing to produce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it to apply the effect to black / white photos as the Farbinocations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-filming effect on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the original image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type Aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digi am; filter Film Festival is a simple tool to produce film labels on your paintings like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the movies to produce the manufacturer large silver baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film baseline is your photo shows a certain mood or seems to move into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere. if you want to move this special, gallery arbitches, road-photographic, basketball, basics, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granarity of the Körner can be calibrated when frequently used higher values, when you need more grains, you can use the filter multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film basketball board on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the specified film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digam; filter oil paintings created the appearance of a oil paintings. it uses a ural-based algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digi am; filter oil painting gives you a nice view like a oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulator to influence these effect. the upper selects the pin size between one and five of. thicker brush are better for large images. smoothing the glass or, from the other side, the Schareness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and this is characterized by the (2). pinselsize for this 640 pixels is 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digi am; filter coal use uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbonic art. pictures whose gradients are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine yourself. this would be good photos to start it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two control knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast (glass).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digi am; engraving engraving your image in 3-D, as if it was marked in the wax, it uses a copyright algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digam; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where the filter is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the picture in a grey landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows you to set the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art works by distortion. it uses well-based protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in cells and can look like whether it is regarded by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Oil blocks 2: analogue to wave blocks 1 is the image here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can break this effects at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in an art works by imaging effects. it uses well-based protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Understanding: referring the picture along the ecular lines from a center point. this simulates a zoomnian camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial accidents: pens the picture by turning the pixels by a medium-point. this simulates the uncertainty of an rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removing blurring: refused the image to produce the effect of a non-focus camera line. the object seems to enter into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion control: pens the image by horizontal movement of the pixels. this simulates the ignorite of a linear moving note: b: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnout uncertainty: sweat the picture soft in the dark and heavily in light tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, Glamour photos or add a warm and subtelling.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelapsody: referring the image by random verification of pixels and simulates the disulary of a arbitches of arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unscholves: take the color spots in the picture and pushed them to change this without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and made it, through the fill with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore terminate this calculation with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="624">The REGENTROPFEN are a nice small tool to make REGENTROPFEN on your image. this gives it a great view. it uses a great view. it uses a from Pieter Voloshyn urhebergedly protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the drip size it is often necessary to reduce the size of the image growth. Number of drops the number and the density of drops. fishing change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digm; image processing is free of REGENTROPFEN. use the selection -tool for example, e.g. a face that is free to stay free. if you start the filter REGENTROPFEN, the area is free of REGENTROPFEN.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of REGENTROPFEN Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the worked picture (2) indicates a sunset after an assault. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture has the false orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or rotating into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu Transforming Rotate or Transforming Spies.</seg>
<seg id="629">Foto stumbs is definitely one of the most recently developed tools to enlarge a photo of a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A painting is simple. the great question is simple. how can you find a picture zoomenon if the limits of the resolution are used? how can you find the missing information about how can you find a good work? how can you see here a good work. try it and you will see it.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scaled it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the target value in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size is using a linear interpolation method to adjust the pixels. if you want a small image with better quality. then try the tool to the blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs are using a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation on the enlarge of a picture. & digi; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say the tool, as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider's new size and are counted below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio said: if this setting is enabled, if the indication of the new size is set to preserve the aspect ratio of the original screen.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. if it is necessary, the larger is required when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect. it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and store will be used as a text file for photo. it can be saved as text file and later again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Foto struck is very fast on what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you. you can check the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below one example for photo inflated by clicking a small-sized image to the double mag. the original is (1) and the larger image (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also a common tool for the mouse, you can easily produce a picture with the mouse, to press the mouse button and move the rectangle with the mouse button. they will look at the mouse while they move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you cut the mouse back again, the area of the photos will be cut out. so you can enjoy a good overview as your photo after cutting edges. you can produce the size of the square. a new rectangle by clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cutting table, you will use the button panel button in the toolbar and the photo will be trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to save or file to save the new photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the front area you can change the size of the rectangle by changing the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In tool for the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or horizontal format. in the portrait format, the larger value of height and horizontal format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio can be used as an aspect ratio. that means that it is always equal, regardless of it, whether you can see centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog box you can cut the range for cutting possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation, in dependence on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool for the aspect ratio can be enrolled up from the aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). if you have the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as standard values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data is reflect the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions help allow support to help you to have your pictures better. these Hilfen are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic distortions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third triangles, harmonic triangles have a possibility to share a rectangle in the diagonals of diagrams.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a pitch that looks the natural growth path like e.g. the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. they deeped in all possible dingen on which we are nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is used to use the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have already used the golden pitch in all times, when you have your paintings, buildings and even photos of your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is the number of Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number after 1 equal to the sum of their two numbers. this rule is as visual harmonic as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents a liquid relief lines when you want to see a picture. these Hilfen are counted below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will reach your goal good results for your photos. in comparison to the third line, the eye can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are called the shields of golden spiral, also called golden spiral. it should be a line to handle the middle of the composition. this can be just like that the eye can easily lead because without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also discussed by the above-discussed gold spiral. please note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles, no equivalent of the triangles can be arranged at this lines as a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you want to use Golden triangles make a effect of the professional Photographs dynamic Symmetry. try out your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you may not reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">Options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors are used to reflect the harmonic participation.</seg>
<seg id="660">With button Color, you can use the color of the auxiliary lines. if you can use a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. on this type you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate any image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontally. you can repair this with the & digi; image processing and the tool free rotational. choose Free rotation and adjusting the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are in degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right-hand side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Module Free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview for the two lines, you can adjust him with a pressure on the left mouse. now, adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a painting, you will find three square holes in the corners. a possibility to repair the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image to cut the function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-aliasing smooths the picture a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perimeter transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the centre of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically calculated. on the right side of Dialoges you will find some information which help you want to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty ranges die by the transformation are originated in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas which originated by the transformation are originated in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed areas.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed areas.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed areas.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed areas.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture shows a little bit. for a single adapt, this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have the perspective, you get a pleasing triangular holes to the corners. a possibility to cut out the image with transformation cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle into a parallelogram. you can use this module over transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your image by turning the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can check horizontally and verify. if you are presetting at zero. a preview of Effective will be displayed on the right and the new dimensions of the target area will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, the mouse will move a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to fix a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the picture, the picture is a bit smeant. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible, but two casings produced double sooner and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">According to Scherung has the image unnice triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate this image with transformation cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digam; requires a number of libraries and other packets to read formats from your system and, in some cases, from the species such as libraries, you can work a large number of images with & digi.</seg>
<seg id="684">Based on this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to specify a list of all on their system available formats, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digi on; displays only files in formats to the field. if the extension is listed in the list, & digm; the file is listed in the image processing. you can change this list of file extensions and others. in the section configuration will find further information.</seg>

<seg id="928">After you created your photos, you can check whether they have created all of the viewer required. if you have created a web browser, after that pages have been created here. the URL that will be set here. otherwise the web browser will start the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you have created the HTML files only in the final goal of HTML files you have to specify the final goal of the files. this is not the subordinat of the current files but the base ordner are in which all the subordinner are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings are related to all three to basordner or URLs. this is a subordinated, whose name is set in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family celebration, a conference or anything else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may want to create a HTML page to consideration the images. if you have already contribute the picture information, persons on the images, recording, etc. only, you need to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even once more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images in a .kin file. these can import others in your database. the image properties will be imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they distinguish whether the images are stored in the file, whether you have to store all the pictures in the file, and this file can be regarded as independent. the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu click Export to... or together with HTML pages, see, if you create an .kin file using a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file is searching for the pictures on double way. first searching the images that are displayed in the folder of .kim -file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim -file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images are described above the menu click Export to...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is to negotiate internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option manuals to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Using the Automated option, copied to .kim-file copy & kware album; the pictures will be automatic for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most images are already compressed using JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is usually not too hard to compressed. if you want to case this, simply select the Export file compressed file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you don't want to send the pictures maybe even in full size, since the .kim -file would be very great. here you can say that each picture is maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to import a file with the extension .kin from the web browser or from the menu file, will select & be recorded, will export the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Assistent for Importers consists of four steps. first you need to select what photos you want to import images that import them to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you need to imported the category persons of the importiering file (if you are a Dances), while this category is asked to imported the categories of the importierite file, and what these categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can read the categories of the categories of your current database including the categories of your current database. an example here is on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simply, images to well and look at: if you look like images, you would like to look more than the pictures of your Italy vacation rental and a picture with your friend you would like to see all images that is illustrated on this friend.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) review of information on your photos, about (2) search through and see, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was begun as a program for managing your paintings. however, it was expanded and still care of your videos. on many places in this manual is spoken through images, but frequently, even videos with a.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kbook album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, such as Normal locking tools, copy on a disk or revisions in the CVS, where it would like to want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kc album; notice the folder where your paintings are automatically again. if you want to read this in future stand. if you want to start a different database in & kc album; you can start a different folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; as an example: kc album -c ~ / company / Bilder / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menentry settings, book album; Set up to a window where you can change the settings from & kbook album; in the following section of the user's book will be explained clearly in the following section.</seg>
<seg id="952">Left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the preview and options for the viewer. for every setting, you can call a detailed help on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In addition, as you are described for every image different features, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to work already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a symbol and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories already mentioned in the category. in the dialog options you can set up a complete membership, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member such as in explains.</seg>
<seg id="956">In you can see the setup possibilities that you can choose the list of Memberships. in the above list, you can choose the category that you want to configure the category in the left window with the current category and in the right of a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kware album; the modelling its modular system with other graphics applications such as digikam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can't be described in this handbook, as they are not sold separately from & kphotoalbum; but most modules have to be sold separately. most modules, which can be distributed over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications, it may be used to test the modules with & kc album; you should try out new modules first using the command &gt; crypt album -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. say not, I could not expect it!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that uses the modules over KIPI together, are very different, which means that some modules can work with & kc album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you divider features with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & kc album; and other applications that can also use their pictures in albums. this kind of order is not supported, simulates that kind of order is not supported, simulated for some modules the order, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Thus simulates and book album; the current album that matches the current view, so all the pictures that allows you to look at the picture.</seg>
<seg id="963">Apart from the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums passed away from this page. this will go on & kc album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & book album; s browsers the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is a album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or, the category you used in the settings dialog as Category for virtual albums, if you want to use the category persons, & kphotoalbum; so do if you have chosen people to view and module this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are equipped with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can use them from the list of modules. start the dialog for dialog and select the modules, which modules are loaded into the modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen, once you & sound album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see it from any other KDE application, you can see the window with the window, which you can see the window that you have no more information about your paintings. in the section we will have no information on this window, then click on this window, which displays you a overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any image with notes. there are more information about the people that are shown on the picture where the image has been recorded separately or for a major number of pictures on all images, and all images taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for the search and browsing, as you can see in the section. if you want to see these notes when you want to use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In you can see three lists with a text box by playing people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following idea is the conclusion of the images within the list step: if you are shown for example a family party and are shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, you can find that the used can be found on the above, the persons can be found faster and can be found.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to select a list of Alphabetical list, click on the icon to sort by the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for any image, you want to work out any selected pictures, and these pictures are equipped with notes. click in this case, simply click on and back-buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. using the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu of multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a overthrow. in order to show that there is a special symbol, a special symbol will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comments, it is possible to add a entry to a existing or new over- or subcategory. please note that this entry was able to make this entry to one subcategory. attention, this is ahead, you just see your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comments to form the coring that form the upper part of the frame, click here and slider. you can also move out of a frame also to pull it out outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you are looking for the window of the window that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... that offers the possibility to save the current structure and view of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also release a frame as well. if you want to receive this window later, do you want to get the button options... and here then window a / hide. this step will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in browser, you will select an overview of selected images of the currently selected images, or all images, if you have no filter for example. you can see the size of the feeds, configure the mouse with central mouse,. try it simply.</seg>

<seg id="985">You can delete images in the image preview photos. select the appropriate pictures from you want to delete or select either the removing button or select the menu click choose. now, you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; you can also use this problem for this problem. you can also use to have you saved on the hard disk. you need to record the images from anywhere in the database. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures taken with which the right upper right corner is not stored on the hard disk. this is e.g. for the images 1-9, however, are not possible to see the images 1-9, but you can see the preview of this images. you can also see these pictures not with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">How you see you need this function that you want to ask files from the files and again. if you don't want to ask the recording of the support CD. if you want to avoid doctors, how to store a larger hard disk to store all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to do the images so that at the end of those who can see you for other unaccessible. alternatively, you can see also all the pictures that can watch your little sister, unless you want to lock.</seg>

<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your paintings with & kc album; manage and hours about hours that you want to consider. from this reason & War album; about one picture _ and video viewer. these can you be described from the preview as described in described above.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can be seen here. it shows the image, but added any more information about the image, like who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture, you can see this simple with the mouse and what you can see more information. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. that's the context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox, please click here. if you want to click the browser, see, matching entries to this page. if you are on Anne Helene here, the browser you have selected all images of Anne Helene. if you prefer people from the browser and then Anne Helene was selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have more images in the viewer, you can switch between them and return the buttons picture high and picture below. you can jump on the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are charged in the viewer. & kware album; invites you to press the new image to just a few seconds. how often do a new image will receive the Ctrl button and plus or Minus. start and stopped the pointing line by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of & spa book album; is it using the full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer. you can simply move into the image and extract you with the mouse easy to move. with the Minus button, you can easily extract the Plus key zoom in the centre of the picture. displays the result of the ZOOMS.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-button you can withstand your zoom, so the image is not trailing. with the equation paste the ZOOMS, so that each pixel is on the screen of a picture of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">NOTE that the only zoomoperations will work with videos that herds and extract with the plus- and minustic.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotary functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this works not with videos. you can make notes on the current picture with menu comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you are viewing, you can find a picture with one person, whose names do you specify on the image. in the moment you can add the view and configuration dialog for the picture to mark these names. they will draw only the image to mark and more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper. to see what photos you can launch the viewer with the pictures and they are as well as good or bad, while you can see one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples at the top there are the possibility of feature pictures with features, while you can see them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can see the respective letters. in view it's a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set up your photos, you are available in browser. if you are always selected, if you are always selected, so provided all at once with notes. this is in described here. this is a module to copy the selected images to a CD or what ever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and particularly characteristics can view at the front view. if you can add categories in dre View view, you can select features to the pictures by changing the letters for the watchword, after the picture was selected here:</seg>

<seg id="1010">The painted old is not saved with the picture but in the database. on the way you can make your paintings later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see a picture on the painted old. to finish the Painting's Painting's Painting menu. in order to finish the Painting menu from the context menu. to finish the mouse button, simply select the cross in the toolbar at the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">In order to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to rule the application of the program & Povray; but you should not be read, but the documentation of & Povray; you should be read, and understood them.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects in the object characteristics and displayed the object in the wire model - views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also choose multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of one already selected objects, as all objects are selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object to the object tree, select the position to insert the object in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are possible positions, the following placement menu will select the right position to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Remove delete either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed, click to apply these changes to apply these changes, please click here with a fault description. then you can read the input error and then click on enquiries or change the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the integration dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL users to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you work a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview of the industry image.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview of the scene file and a small example of the scene is selected by the selected texture. if you want to render a part of texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross-locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can change this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is chosen, the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and turning as well as the position for displacement. you can change the shift by pulls with the mouse in the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object model has a visibility level. you can specify this value relative to visibility level or as absolute value. objects will only be selected or equal to its visibility level smaller or equal to the scene stage of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window regulations as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like to connect the standard window or if you don't want to adjust any other arrangement, you can save multiple shutter register and simply switch between different regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To remove a window above or under a present view, draw the initial to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, go to the right or left side of a view. the new view is attached to the right or left side of this view, extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to pass several views over each other, you can move the beginnings into a different view. you can then change the views over the map sheet at the top in the views.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you create a scene, you may be render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for render, this program has to be correct installed. as this manual was written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 are not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the icon of the Symbol's icon or select the menu entry scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. if you want to return the image and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can specify any many Render modes in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on symbol The Render Settings menu in the toolbar or in the menu View Render modes... select the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, however, is a name that recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the right image size. if you want to return a small area of the image. if you want to return a small area of the image cut and enter the image cutting of the rendering in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination of quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; this is used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the Render-Properties can be found in user's guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture with only one beam of the pixels, there are different errors found. these pictures have no fashion effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not shown if they are not shown in the representation of smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally see pictures with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you want to switch an anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than a beam ever pixels. this technique is called Super-Sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recive method; adaptive because the super-sampling method; repeating the super-sampling point, because each pixel is further down and adaptive because the Rursion depth is derived from the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray has a beam of pixel. if the difference between the values should be set to the adress of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you are calculated a temperature of 4x4 additional points, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -G 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The Rekursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the colours, the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels that can be checked individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depths.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect to avoid the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changing & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflect is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this cardboard box you can adjust if the Alpha-channels can be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the associated stockings have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So, you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without precise knowledge of the two programs. if you want to create simple scene, among the beginnings: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should see the following warnings, see you decide that you will receive a black screen when you use a 3D program for first time you should note these major rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set up any camera, no rules for the rendering will be used as a result as a result.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have been installed all error-free, you see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following prescriptions:</seg>

<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows the entire scene, which you generate. in particular note that the scene from the view of the camera. this is the scene from the view of the camera. this shows the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains now a new entry with the designation camera. if you click here, see the contents of the object diagram, where the various parameters of the camera will be found in the user documentation of & Povray; you can find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything concerning the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that the camera can change the camera into the control system, with which you can change the goal of the camera. click here with the left mouse button on an KonTrollPunkt, and draw him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you want to use button or Enter, change the wire model-views and the object-tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the sight of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the scene for the scene. you could easily add a Quader (insertion body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simple way option. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button to use or Enter. in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is now also the level, even at the moment just as a limited level. if you reach the scene, extends the level up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you want to view the object-tree, you will see the entry for the bottom. in this case you can see the default options for every new object: scaling, rotary and shift. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise on the horizontal line, just order to select some of these parameters. choose reference and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose the ground to produce its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue is inserted into which you can select first object. please select the name in the object-tree (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button Preview you can see how the Pigment now looks.</seg>

<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you get your picture with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not able to enter the color list. here are two new attributes, called Single colour list. choose this entry twice (you can also do this entry twice (you can do this entry), but the chess boards can only be used only with two colors:</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the colors in the object-tree in any single colour and change the colors in the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be simply execute you, since you have the basically active work of & kpovmodeler; the sphere should be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can change the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to press Enter or button closure), so the ball can be floating with the ground. otherwise the sphere would be silent over the ground, because they have the ground to be shifted down below the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results now is a weird result: how already previously see the ball's appears like a shear black material. put it in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now prove a material. like the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as Color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the names for example in ball pigment. click to the pigment, select the Single Colour and set the values as follows:</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the function of the task, so is rather your taste and the type of your task, which the denying programs you will be denied.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter assume that you can use the command line for dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you need to make sure you need to make sure that & k3b; then start the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; features that all & KDE; program are painted, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts, the below are described above.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coefficients and compression rates and helps you make the right code of the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio files are lost, a lost audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' Monkey ', which are perhaps for these distribution. the disadvantages are roasted and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, which you lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, are MP3 and OGG the most common bit rates at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but beyond this bit rate, the differences are less important when both codiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'NOT so 'free, lame is free with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality in lower bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also belongs to other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card) or special car stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting is usually sufficient for most people and most music-acceptable transparency, and has already high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps, for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs some older devices for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRB. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of young people, portable devices and Autostereoplants. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you do not necessarily the absolutely highest quality, without the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, enter manual or by the program automatically from the freedb via the internet are available as a list of parameters. you can be delivered with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the file and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coaxial systems there is often a combination of program Settings for the coding and this parameter here. the manual or the help to the coding guidelines are the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; Title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator is added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is available: a free database, in which the audio CDs can be read, so that all other information can be read in the computer, please note that there is only from text files: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not lawyer. however, no man cannot be attorney. however, the information is not lawful for the & CD; more or less worlos, so there is neither the artist nor the music company damage. all information can be done by a & CD; business, physical or virtue.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator is active in the system used (Send of an address). this type of configuration can be used in this type of configuration, the email address is not used (This can only be used only the programmer that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries of the main database. if & kaudiocreator is used for use of freedb, the geographically on the next mirror server will be used. this saves a bandwidth in the network and the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to Freedb.org supplies a current list of mirror servern for online-demand from & CD; or during the reading of a & CD; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (normally a rule monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What a readable program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumour that it is used to know, searching for the source code.... This was already the best choice for the read of audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution first must be installed if this is not yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the WAV files can be chosen to select the desired file format for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data). other coding can be added to this register.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code package must be installed from the support Linux distribution, before the codification is required. this is also required for the predefined coding. more information on codierer in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codierers, further information can be obtained via the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have a lot of causes. check the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and read on your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try, both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might be a note what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; read the cover of the & CD; this will not be done!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you want to use other settings, this tips do not need to pass.</seg>
<seg id="1543">If you have read the complete manual, everything understood, but there are no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will need enough information about those areas to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we start the program for the first time, everything set up and our first & CD; we will see lame '--preset extreme' using a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps, on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available for example with a search engine, as it is not fully free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files. anyway, what you may always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg. by using the conqueror slightly inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section treats the basic influence of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably only once done.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second part describes the approach to read a & CD; what must be repeated for any time & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we find our encoding code for compress of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps), we would like to use the program using the freedb to use the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings, we will not change it very likely to read more & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device drawing is handed over to the readable program to read it & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link on the real device drawing. if this is not working or a CD; / DVD drive system can also be accessed to the file / etc / fstab in and an attempt to connect the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map of the general settings. here gibts are not much to do. here you can see an additional conversion. in our example, everything will be displayed as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for the complete information please select that you will be informed if your data is missing (Tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download on the internet by a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">NOTE: the calculator has to be connected while reading & CD; with the Internet access, he may access to the freedb Server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simple, is a & CD; entry starts immediately, if you have been very satisfied with the database entry and the result will be easily changed with the database entry and the filename, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter the selection Fields and freedb, if you can download the database, however, if you can download the database before. however, this is the database above. however, if you have selected the database, however, the two selection fields is selected, at least the first one of the mode will be set at the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is available for us freedb. these are settings for the data on request; information from the freedb servers on the Internet. like white the system that will be the CD? Read the passage about freedb. place everything so, as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to the page freedb.org and look according to a mirror server in your vicinity. this road turns the load between the computers. this setting will not work as the first test.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function does not work on the server, but there are many Fireplace the protocol 8880 standard, maybe even more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surd.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want to pass any & CD; data to the freedb Server. the first check box should be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Take the settings from screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp is present on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously devotive pieces: Understanding, there is a reason why do more than one at the same time with only a existing drive? rip reading and coding? the author knows it not, so simple himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it to design this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: if you need this enabling, then it can be useful if only place on any other drive. this can't be displayed on the private folder where you do not want the files in private folder where you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All so, as it is on the screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances to see anything at all.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s, such as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. this is a good balance factor is 6.3. this is a good equilibrium between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">NOTE the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the generation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent value for the name of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables in the name of the procedure (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to coded WAV files: with an Dual Core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setting of & kaudiocreator; completed. this configuration will be used as standard for any evaluation of a & CD; if you have voted the organizational structure of your music, you need them to change again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section the process is described in this section as described as the process of the presentation of the & CD; we will be installed in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the CD; dates back to the freedb. the process of this section is necessary to be repeated for any time & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are using a & CD; you're not able to see the screen shots a little differently than the for a & CD; with successfully by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of them from the Internet. Comments to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not happen, the & CD has to be defined in the drive which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length can be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; be identified as audio CD; identifies and by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then you are looking for questions and answers to the help or enter back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully passed by the freedb, all the titles of the pieces have already been filled and also displayed the name of the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that it is more than a entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives you a window in the database and you can select the database entry at the best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't select the check box for the automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; you can also selected manually from the choice of the first Knopfs in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step02: the CD editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the item in the first line of the 'actuator title', the rest of data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'actuator title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower Commentary box can be used for the individual comments of inidiocally per piece, the commentary box of the album will be used for comments on all pieces of CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb is not empty, but it already contains the data like in the following screen photo, but it's not just like to check the content of the CD's name (e.g. whether all words with grandparents are or not...), but also to check if there are any additional notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">NOTE: in this example, we use ID3v1-Tags. this is limited, length of the fields on 30 characters for the letter, album, and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment. if you need ID3v2 Tags. this option is set up on the subject area set; take a look at the registration option. take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 Tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags: not supported by all coatings or file formats. see in help to obtain more information to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select a entry that obviously did not be important with the style of the disperture CD; this example is this not important that we would like to find the information on the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example to find Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK "you return back to the main window. click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors will be back and you see that the fields for the album already revealed with the given data, which we have listed for the first item. the title of the item is one. the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process to enter the same way up to all the title of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not if you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories as the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. NOTE that the artists and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">NOTE that there is a check-in before each line. a simple click on the line turns out a or out. make sure your pieces are selected or, please select the button in the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces onto a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was launched by clicking on button selection out of the readout process, this window appears to confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the lectures and trace what process.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider on the order window. it is on the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for monitoring the orders. the first item is read only on the hard disk. the status of the program is shown at the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a codierer that you have not installed there. pieces that were not successfully installed with a red 'X' in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the objectives are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked the file to the folder for temporary files and the objectives?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear that the error occurred right after the end of the first item occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece of which is finished. but we have completed a new entry: job 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. therefore, please read the status of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of program has no configuration settings found to read this behavior, is the result of parallel to read and coding. the used computer is unclear. the used machine with a AMD64 appears to date and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>

<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variations on settings. best read the step by step example. it shows screen shots of different card cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, always read on it? even if only the help menu after the first time of the program, without any reason how it is going to proceed out of such as an empty screen (especially when it is no audio CD; in the drive), or the unusually short menu from?</seg>

<seg id="1624">You can open a Open... from the menu click here. it appears to select the usual file dialog when you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also use a file from a & conqueror; window in the & kmid; window, this works also with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To open a music part, open it and press the button closure to play in the toolbar, select the entry play from the menu or as a press the vacant button.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts, once you move it on the & kmid; -window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played a row.)</seg>

<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust an event type, select from the menu settings the entries of texts or lists the same function, also keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you want to summarize. these are the series after being played. in this section, how you can use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To open a collection, open first the collection manager. this will find you in the menu collection under the point organise.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then click the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the use of the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">During the application of application, these collection will not stored this collection when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager to add a song. it appears to add a song. it appears to select the file dialog which can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting automation to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add-adding to the collection, a piece during opening (using the file or drag & drop) will be added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Auto is not enabled to activate the temporary collection, the temporary collection is activated and worked together. this collection will be added to the openable pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to select the collection manager that select the collection and the desired song and then click here.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order to select songs in the songs. if you select the series after the menu from the menus collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove songs or random order in the menu, the order will be respecified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke Text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button Next song, please press the next song or press the button to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to skip a song, select the button one button, the entry one piece from the menu or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete the collection and click on button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. it doesn't matter if they are not saved while ferment & kmid; don't be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for Synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events in events which is synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in the events of the type Change patch to Trumpet, and is always a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS-Cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is no programs to create MIDI maps. you need to work the appropriate file from hand (with your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that you need all required connection for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which is so often as desired. for this is, however, that each shows a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END OF KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END OF KEYMAP "A more Keymap"... END define CHANNELMAP... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is used to show that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, that I offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard are depicted. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches usually occur in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to insert the sound with the number M (e.g. GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which allows you to use one drum (e.g. with sound 60), you can write the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now, a MIDI file would play a note with patch 127 (puncle file), it takes you patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the clay 60, regardless of which, which is sound in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept drum patch included (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;), and not the one that is the sound level of the sound level of the same drum (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify as sounds like a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like at PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, and their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define up for each channel and every instrument several Keymaps. you must only use several names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to prevent shades on the Perkussions-Channel. check out as the delivered Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to specify some channels to others. if you want to try the first and the second channel, make it the very simple in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have a percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the Channel. if you want to use Keymap with the name name for this channel. if you want to change the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful to use the persions patch on the Perkussions patch on the Perkussions patch.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitching ratio can be multiplied, in which a MIDI file will be converted using the value n, this is converted with the value of n * (r / 4096) and then it will only be redirected to the value 4096, so that in the map file there is no decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is used to play a keyboard, the value 4096, a sound higher play. unfortunately, but unfortunately some keyboards will play up to play up to a octave. to play the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, you can open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, you can see the sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have a instrument, if you have changed an instrument, you don't want to display button no more green but red to show that no more original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to show the miracles with the mirrors. view in the menu settings under the point of channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed to play with a song. each higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you like to find a song, you can change it to change the text, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about it, like a music piece, it contains the sheet music, the speed, & etc; so that it may lead the same MIDI file to very different results, as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I may not need to use none. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a good synthesizer, you can change a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the different instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binaries (rpm, dew) by & kmid; so it happens, because & kmid; without AWE-Support compile you need to download a source change and install (for example by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a full folder to a collection, but I have no wust to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">One understood, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder where you want to add in & konqueror; choose all files from, and draw them on the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Activate before necessarily the collection to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow shaft to the left from the Tempor- LCD, to play the reproduction. to recover the default tempo you can click the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I used on a & KDE; -working area a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this mode I would like to play a file if the collection is to play, just into the & conqueror; -window change and select the desired file to the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without added to a collection, use the setting automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's take you to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mies, you will only play the first file to play the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection, then this is precisely this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to create B.mid and C.mid and a collection with all three files. how do you make it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards collected. all thanks! if I hear these songs or the postcard see, animated me this, further on & kmid;</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window will be made from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed if information in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to use the preferred connections under the menu Bookmark, but these are individual entries if you want to play a list of entries, so you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups of groups to get an additional hierarchies. if you have a entry of anctuals, will copy his group and all his subgroups to the current category and playback starts with the attached record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist can also be changed through the editing of XML configuration files. it can also be changed by a editor, but also through the application. this is easy to choose from the menu click here and as next processing mode. through the cliffs of a subgroup will be displayed only the XML content of this tea.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected from the menu of the same with playlist and either the processing mode, or another category will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode left or another group will be selected without a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Some functions of the author of & kmplayer; can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starten and berries can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation must not be short briefly, it will automatically terminated automatically through the opening of another source. this would be even if the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the displays of a favourite photos; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; are the source package of & kmplayer; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL formats of & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configuration of my player in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the meantime size of data logged from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for the failure is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the issue of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playlist dialog for this playlist of the file dialog for & kmplayer;. everything must be configured through mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played in & kmplayer; it can even be played using the special field for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module must be used as service providers for the Mime-type application / x-Shockwave-flash in an application dialog for the regulations from KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; is available in a consoles on the charging of the browser module. if no error occur, is the backend issue within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In this way, a preset backend for a certain motime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all ogg files will be removed:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can be done by TV cards, either using MPlayer or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). can be configured to the used device and the TV channels, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data records) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog should be detected in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. it should be found out of which one can be selected. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer only Xvideo can also work (maybe this kind of the playful of video equipment is also supported). this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server need to be functional in his configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMplayer for sources different names. at the time of this documentation, these dvdnaval, source, source, pipesource, tvscanner, source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are enabled, start playing the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is known as user root after the integration of the device. it is necessarily safe to ensure that / dev / cdrom is the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1760">With the automatic installation of the environments (e.g.\\ Begin {command}) of & kile, automatically generated an empty line (e.g.\\) {command}). this function can be deactivated by default settings; set up... LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; permits the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">At the view of the document in the structural view, the individual items can be changed by a mouse click on the appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating the own & Latex; -files can be useful for the creation of your own & latex. as soon as a DVI, -file [straight-independent File)] is created, jumps & kile; caused by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewing the appropriate line in & Latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI-file contains a description of the formatted document and other information like the font format of & tex; or & Latex;. there are many tools to view, transformation and to print by DVI; -files for different systems and straight.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the pick-up, the elements of the DVI; -file is clicked to the product code in & Latex; -source code spsee is the exact part of it. once on an section in & latex; source code is clicked to the corresponding place in the DVI; -Betraviewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-document: this function is used to work with several files. using one master document the work with other one-related .tex -files simplifies an project-wide master document on project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Construction: the & Latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (unless error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File extension: in this mode, the DVI; file on the freehedâ ¬ â ¬ and it is no call from & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">For consideration of the processing -tool bar, the three large selection criteria are developed for the quick charger in the document. the first selection box is suitable for the fast breakdown of documents in parts, chapters, chapters,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection table for further information is as subject of articles such as keywords, fuels, or wise. verification for members are:</seg>

<seg id="1781">The extrusion changes will only be taken within the environment (of\\ Begin {I0} to\\ '{I0}). there is no complaint (number) for members within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many thanks to the reading and user friendliness of the document. it can be found certain fonts, fat pressure, cursivure, submissions, etc. these commands are either through the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for the cursivure and is such as GÃ ¼ ltig, until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word can be displayed in a set with\\ emh {word} cursiv.</seg>

<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant to the assistant, a few adjustments for the better performance of the document might be used. these quotes a quote, some places in the fat and cursivure and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed using Editor-View or Ctrl E back to the editor (when the internal viewer) must be closed on the internal viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">As soon as the DVI / file format was created, the document can be converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file would be converted and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a possible file format (English, D e V ice I nindependent). these files are made by & tex; or & Latex; for the readability of some drivers like the .dvi -issue such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF - converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; -file the same steps as for the creation of the document can be printed on the clicking on the 7th step - and can be printed on the clicking device (if the printer is set correctly) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar feels the conversion of the DVI; -file in other formats. once the DVI; -file made out of the & latex; source code was created, the conversion in recovered other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The prehtsating search for direct jump from the editor to the product information within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & Latex; -BinÃ ¤rfiles. this must only be used more modern music tracks using Kile... Tools Glue.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To teach the mouse button, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source texture and seemed to be clicked on pre-looking for the corresponding place in the DVI; -Betraviewer.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; is defined by a click of the Middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document the appropriate & latex; document can be specified in & eyepiece; as text editor (settings set eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of quick-rebuild & DVI; -viewing cannot be an error. should be an error, this is shown in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file is to be the error source in the source code. in the Editor, the error file will always be used to consider the error in the error. to specify the faulty line. to be clicked to the error in the logging and & kile: jump to faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as on the appropriate button, the toolbar will be able to select a window for the select template for the document. the default user can be set:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a document, document can be written either from the reason to rewritten or assistant to the fast creation of a new document. further information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">User parameters of & Latex; use usually the same introduction for almost all documents. templates available in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, it must be created either a existing & tex; - / Latex; -file would be created or create a new template using an existing document and selection of the template's document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document as a template using the file, some drawing chains are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character set). these variables can be set up in settings... settings can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is necessary to know what kind of variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input category. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to imagine a template is the use of the assistants and that this way is published in the editor. as soon as the document created the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template instead of standardized standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & Latex; -files created a simple way to create a template, should searched for one in the Internet and described the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; used as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be used directly from & kile; can be taken out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">In order to learn more about & Kate; and his mouth should be taken to Kate. users of & kile, can start there directly with the read of the editor of & Kate; start now.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical and latex; command line that can be called for the LaTeX Reference 'command, which can be used for nearly all commands that can find in & latex; and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with pressed Ctrl button, to choose the & tex; -word to choose between\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When reading the text, mouse button is copied to clicking the clicking text automatically into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, with push back switch button, possible parts of the source texts in the editors window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile: has the differences of different types of source issues and these emerging. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are raised by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants decent explosions are concerned. this is a very own kind of bookmarks or last jumps, or the corresponding key stamp. this is also the jumper stamp, so that they will be automatically changed at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the major aspiration of the program such as & kile; even though & Kate; already outstanding functions for the writing of a & Latex; -source texture. & latex; special commands for their selection. amongst others are the following commands to choose text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Based on both sides (group of lines, which contain on both sides a blank line). this expanded meaning that tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source texts. the only significant thing in & kile; is that the extension are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">However, the word below the current Cursor position. this selection has also a extended meaning that this command is also & latex; commands with a return star (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To explore a part of the document may be natal. & Kate; offers the entire line away. & Kate; offers the entire line away. & kile, offers the following commands to get a faster storage. among others are the following commands to read the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete section. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been demonstrated that environments is a central role in & Latex;. therefore, & kile: for more commands under beats environment for a possible easy work with & latex.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command you will be detect to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the present position is). the cursor will be placed directly before the command to the place of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you will be detect at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor will be placed directly behind the command.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If you have cursor within the command\\ Begin {surroundings} is detained at the end of the surrounding area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many administrated environments you can go quickly the Ã - bery change. this command seated the last environment, so that the scattered environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are identified by clamps {...}. under assist Tex-Group are a few important commands that are made of berries.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command you can detect at the beginning of the actual group (no matter where the present position is). the cursor will be placed directly before the thursing clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is detonated at the end of the actual group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor will be placed directly behind the glued clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If it is cursor before or behind the wall clamp of a & tex; -group # 12, the other end of the group conversations (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many slaughtered groups-staples can be lost as fast the rest group. this command seated the last group that the scattered structure of the & tex; -groups cannot be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & Latex; there are two simple beginnings as GÃ ¤nsefÃ ¼ r used in & kile; the character "for two simple beginnings will be used in & kile; the character" for two simple beginnings will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic set of double levels can be set up in settings by using Kile... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be used also LÃ ¤nderspecific settings (e.g. nfrench or french) and thus German or French. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When Shift is controlled by Shift; Enter, an intelligent line break. if you set the current position within a liest environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), but not only one line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">The current line with\\\\\ have covered the current line with\\\\ with a sedimentation round line.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already provides a good source code, this in & kile; for special commands (usually for & latex.) are still extended. these modes can be expanded as required. all these modes can be set for automatic downwards. all these modes can be set up for different working modes...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment by the command\\ Begin {environment} is automatically add the command\\ '{surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the diXML to and declare they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users to have a better viewing and more information on the work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries will be explained in simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an XML document. it can contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it can nothing to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tags of the tags is a script function. when using the use is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2012">A container day that can be assigned to the elements of a list. it can only be used for a attributor description. it's just a element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Puts the position of the attributable of a tags within a dialogy. this day can be used for each attribute in one dialog once (e.g. once for each & lt. &gt; -Day). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">There is the position and size of a field in Dialogue. this day should be present for every field in the dialog box once (e.g. one for each & lt. &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements to define the tags within one of the defining tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is an element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; file type: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be embedded and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Do not affect nothing but be found on & and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; replaces any leg, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the XML files, the Tools dialog above is start at the & quantaplus; -window and check the XMLA. a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, checking only when charging the XML files are in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 diXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file will be schema.day.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A action can be created with settings of actions... be created on New action in the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion can be assigned to the keyboard button. with clicking the button, a key curve can be removed from the button. the current key can be removed from the button.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it may be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of action, this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful tool type. using this promotion, it can change external applications (or parts of the document) that can change the document or as input (or parts of the document) or the various directory in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As first, the name of the script and the interpreter will be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although skilled paths are recommended to use the% scriptures / share / apps / Quanta / share / apps / Quanta / share / apps / Quanta / scripts on their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file it will be removed from the document.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process it replaces. if by & quantaplus; only one instance, it's only one instance, if DCOP is used to be used if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above, a script input of & quantaplus; can be determined by using & quantaplus; in the selection box input, what to send the default value. possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is transmitted to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output can be redirected to the output of the application. there are two types: normal output, based on the standard edition; error messages should be written to the default edition of the issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a own toolbar. in the indicated case it's not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar, you need to add promotions and configure actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New action kopist at the lower end of the window starts the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day Attributes, and you plan your use, activate dialog "Day up, when it is possible to use a input during using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is the ideal symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this icon? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To establish a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconedit; use it from the & kmenu; graphics further programs (or where it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, we need 22x22. to change this, select File size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the original icon does not only helps you know what the action does not do but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regard to the day that day start is, I decided to make a start button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is generally interpreted), or should be interpreted, or should be interpreted, please click here to insert this symbol no & lt; -Tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of symbol, it must be connected to the action. this occurs on the menu with settings through the menu. (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">If you want to use button and set them with other tags, so it gives you, or confirm your OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose, you want to adjust some usual & quantaplus; functions for toolbar or it should be shared with some trackers in several groups. open the toolset dialog for Settings tool. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the traps (quite left above) for my tool bar. after the selection of the element that will be added to toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick possibility to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the trackers support the group. someone that could not know my tool bar could believe that the & conquerors; button is the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by Protry of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the proper folder. after NeueXML does not exist, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please check their & descriptionrc; so that their tools will be loaded (s) if a file is open from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioned range of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripts or the form language. desit describes this chapter, how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if a man has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create a existent documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need the docrc file. then we need the docrc file here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation section 1 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, 2 = -2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of the documentation tree in documentation. for example, please see in the & PHP; documentation here:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc thee = php42 / # top level elements of contents = index.html Getting Started =,,... = paras.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">NOTE that # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that there is no familiar border for the cartons (except the interuning) mdash; but try it itself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">They know that the contents directly to a file referenced (and consistently) at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; file will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Do not affect nothing but be found on & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcfiles are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The syntax-section is the range of the docrc file, which serves as the documentation of the function named and press of Ctrl; H for Context Help, the documentation directly indicated. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connectors.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of two separate context elements which should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc file, save as $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then you create a folder (as you like this in your file docrc), as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is well and worth it, please send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to use the & quantaplus; -community. they are not rich, but proud to be with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packets, tools with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send via EMail to friends, partners or else to have sent to send an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) with email ship, toolbar menu of files and folders on templates and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be loaded in our main archive where all other & quantaplus; users can be checked and only available, if our team needs more than correct and effective for the release. the source of resources are guaranteed, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">While uploading will not be asked for your private GPG key (Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you can search one out. in the dialog of New resource, you can find out a detailed (URL-preview can remain unloading) and click OK for the upload of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD-Package (DTEP) package, toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and skripte tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After download a resource, even before installation, studied & quantaplus; the disabilities of the integrity and Signization. if the integrity are given and it can be demolished. if the integrity are given and the resource is correct with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which currently is currently being created by using an DTEP package is needed, because hundreds of day files in the tagXML format may be needed. there are the easiest way to convert an DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and convert a DTD option. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which will be used. thereafter the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination: the newly created & DTEP; is written in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep file.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the string, which in! DOCTYPE Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / etc e.dtd will be released</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, which can be adapted to use the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there is a few key concepts. to move these to understand and full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter tries to make them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projectile. this differentiation is concerned for a series of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses everything that global tool should be saved in shared folders of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators of different tools, actions and samples in the global tree, which will be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web developer for a single user. these are custom-specific designs and tools. local elements are stored in user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a certain project. this may be said all of & CSS; -Mustern up to tool strips with special actions especially for the files of a certain project, which is the most common use of special tools and samples of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building views, the boxes with information and the toolboxes. please suggest you in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document as close to the current, other or all cartridges, reloading, delete or upload the document, jump to a permalink or type of CVS command to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in editors to a further context menu of the document, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / sign), editing of the mouse pointer or open the file if the string, below the mouse pointer is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editors of the Editors. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional will be displayed as standard, for the set of tools and quantaplus; the toolboxes are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tools are really easy. if you want to insert it, please click the symbol that you would like to specify the day that you can specify the data for this straight. now, you can add the data for this straight, you can add several attributes to fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow it to navigate to open information & quantaplus; to navigate to open and distortion. in the representation of boxes, project, pattern templates, document structure, script, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool for the project & quantaplus; preparations are all files in the project and permits management files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as regards, loading, loading or deleting the files from the storage media can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection them are always available, local templates are always available, local templates only for the relevant users and templates are only available in the project. more templates available in this project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. this is also available here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can also call the available information on a script will be available here like e.g. the script will be able to work or send via email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view it shows the internal structure of the active document. by links on the element of the element, the cursor will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and review of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building views. with him, some quickly attributes and namespace. this is the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. it can be presented to create a documentation for & quantaplus; 'documentationssite can be presented and considered a folder doc to a project can be edited documents and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes can be achieved at the lower end of the window, via the effective information can be used: the news window and the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about any in Quanta's running skeletpt. such as the just used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD is shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all error in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -Skripte which are executed, give all error messages (so that there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolboxes are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will receive the respective command. the chocolate prepare is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-Archive by & kmail; and if you get an toolbar in an EMail, they can secure this in & quantaplus; as any other features and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is sensible if you want to fit the place of the & quantaplus; to get there a number of options that can specify the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, specify. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at the species of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 I folders. also you should make sure no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While efforts to create the best & HTML; editor began to employ the developers of & quantaplus; an independent, extent market-languages Editor would now be, it would be an independent Web development tool for & KDE; so it was done! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not longer on pure & HTML; limited, and quantaplus; now on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be in & XML; then it should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above mentioned above, that & quantaplus is based. & quantaplus; it is not possible to use other things? thanks to & KDE; -rumour is not only everything possible, but it allows users to extend users and developers, & quantaplus; so as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows for use of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand the productivity almost every task. by the program Commander you can find & quantaplus; expand without any skptlynsyntax. (more about it will be found in.)</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the best from above to the bottom of the project called for the rest of the project called for the rest of the project. all these paths can be automatically completed later with Shift; F7 Projekt project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. if the input of the name is automatically filled in file.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; -project File. by default it has the names of the project in small letters and without spaces (e.g. foo.webprj). this file will be stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine that you can access local data. either a name (hostname.exel.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you can use this field, the default settings of the selected protocol is required. depending on the remote computer might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the file to be saved in which templates for the project. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a common collection of files are used for various projects, these folders should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tools are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbar. if a common collection of files are used for various projects, these folders should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">Allows you to add files from local file system into the project. it can be selected several files or all files.</seg>

<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. they are asked if you want to store if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens if you want to load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project construction view gives free access to the files in the project. there can be the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File behavior, however, missing the entries and open the entries with the right mouse button on the right mouse menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be found here. the profile contains information on the site of the upload files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will end the button to prevent removing distances.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in core memory and in programmer. this possibility is useful when the most frequent upload files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the plate save -option is not available in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply change the dialog when you change your opinion in front of the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high lady profiles can be created and thus uploaded the project (or parts of the project) to various server. when working or creating a profile, this dialog is shown:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address should work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this must not be changed, except the network administrator is not possible on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your spruce, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. do it be saved on the plate, so that it may not be read, but any of programming can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tools. it can be downloaded in a project many views, i.e. by easy diving of view, many files and tools are loaded and replace the currently drawn files and tools.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings the tool bar tool bar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one do most to do so. this helps do not increase productivity but also permits the adjustment of & quantaplus; to the own desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are tools in & quantaplus; the best about the menu toolbars. use and add to the toolbars. the Add of toolboxes will be treated below the section of toolboxes.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolboxes and the symbols can be set to be set to the toolbar (right click on the toolbar), it can be set to set any tools like toolbar, toolbar or toolbar, what can be displayed in the dialog, where you can be displayed on these or other tools.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By Appeal of the context menu to a promotion (icon) on a toolbar, additionally displayed the entries and action list, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolboxes and actions on them can set up on them in the menu with settings and settings through the settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the main document of documents, code escalopes and files to linking. & quantaplus; uses templates generally as a splenches filesystem with advanced organisation and interfaces. can be copying & each of the system existing directory in & quantaplus; in about the limitations, which represents the file system for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided conditions for their application. please read the conditions in front of any template at the beginning of every template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually published in documents using linings (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found under global templates. further information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be published by any text document type. based on this template can be created new documents in corresponding way to be efficiently and organizes the work in corresponding way to be efficiently. some examples may be found under global templates. see also for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text could always be inserted into the documents. you can find all examples of a comment on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available at global templates. see also for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, serve this templates for all sites as templates. you can be arranged a collection of various documents that can be combined in a compressed tar-Archive. currently there is no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Draw a document structure to taste (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as a copy as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this happened, you notice that (even if a project is stored) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the plant tree under project management.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Please select the text in your document and click here as a copy selection as local / project templates. alternatively, the choice is simply pulling with screened and put on the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only one of the file formats. it can be used to be used to view and insertion or insertion over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can enter into the file tree or in the project files tree view on a folder on the right click and site please select a name for the template, but naturally can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very zieloriented approach. you can add headlines and foot files or in addition, or with them link. in addition there are some things that keep on templates very defound in eye on the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The system structure in the window templates is based on the in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / Templates are displayed in one of four types of containers such as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To select the behaviour of a folder to click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low, as soon as Elterrestriction attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is standard enabled by default and fits all branches in the process of models. if a tribe lacking would be explicitly disabled, except it would be explicitly enabled. if nothing would be explicitly in this path. if nothing appears, it is likely to be in a Chief Apostle.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows the ordered or notified text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines and footsteps into a folder with special headlines / foot files a whole presentation already using the matching headlines / foot files.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you have the context menu (to show, right mouse button) on a complete command collection for the Add folder of files or copying templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; and source text Editor, which replaces the menu click here. the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can editing and if needed to the source code editor, which are visible in the source code in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on an Document, which & PHP; contains a small green symbol to editing the VPL; editing. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing, is still the source code editor. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second Mode works just like the first, except that the cursor in the source code editor and in VPL; editor are synchron in the source code editor and in VPL; editor is already active, the key pressure of the active cursor of a window to others, whereby the position can be kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronous distance between the VPL; editor and the source code is adjustable via a choice of VPL; -view can be set between synchronisation after one click or automatically. generally the recommendation can be set automatically. generally, the recommendation can be set to a small range for quick calculator and a great sanne for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">If you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose the processing of invisible Tags with the VPL; editor. this document is also called, once a new document with the VPL; editor. this is used to change the reduction of the spring hook. this means you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags designed the storage of information about the document, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added to the memory of the content, such as keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the contents of column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of the design of the testimony of the testimony. you can add CSS rules on the list or delete. a change about the list is exactly like in the Meta elements. the Edit of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to adjust the external CSS style templates only by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is like in a paper processing, because of convenience with arrows, the cursor can be used as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted with button or remove button or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be taken in the same way about the toolboxes, like in the source code Editor, please note that the insertion of tags is already existing if an anchor day, surrounded by text, must be inserted with text, any other umblers must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tools like the Tables-Assistent or the Listen-Assistent are deactivated. they will work later in & VPL; the tables or lists have to be used in this release.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the analysis of style templates. in contrast to other programs, the search for certain elements are possible and the execution of the Stilvors can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for Compare. why then & kuses 3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributions is corrected and corrected many places in the same file. a further programming had changed in the same file. the result were numerous conflict with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program found me just the changed lines, I could not see what exactly are changed within this lines. and there were no critics to the places where you could only be changed. this compilation of this changes was a smaller album.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; the differences between one line and changes in white signs. later, there were even more useful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare this text, copy it simply into the clipboard and add him in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the Compare and merger of Orders. this function vertically & kuses 3; almost in a fully-ready file-browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way interconnection is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece coatings and Changes. the original file is able to process the result of conflicts and shows the result even directly. the screen photo shows the result even directly. the screen photo shows three quiz files at merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also complete with the Compare and Merging complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; the folder collapses:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exakened differences and testify these opportunities heures of color monitore. if you'll need to check these function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed only in a certain amount of white signs, you can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side. (no doctors more if Jemand the changes changes).</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files the same name, but in different folders, you can facilitating the animal work easier to write the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordnerner kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner?</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual change of file names, select a selection of the file list. the Open dialog box will notice your selection and displays them at the next time. you need to place the record for C empty, the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folders.... you can also select a folder where you will select the folder or merger from Orders. if A file is selected, for B and C however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file names from A in both other files.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active for the goal and can not be necessarily to use immediately an output file. you can also download this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">Introducing button button opens a dialog with settings. here you can start options before you start with the Compare / summers.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text compare. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the interactive comparison period. the comparison starts now, you can select the dialog box with the abomiting button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use decorative and install: drag simply a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought about? sometimes contains a file such as many similar functions. if you'll need to create a relatively large effort. you would like to create a relatively large effort. you can easily copy and compare these relevant sections. now you can easily copy the relevant sections, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">NOTE: currently, you can extract nothing from & kdiffuse; only the coral reprint of text in a comparison-window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the screenings and put text into another program as a cut and insertion (instead of copy and insertion). in such case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each textures the info-line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (please note that window C is optional), let the mouse over the line. then the mouse over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the complete name.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a number of paint blue, B and C is magenta. (this presets can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is known, one of the file is distinguished. if both files are distinguished, the default colour is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you can see three files. this is in the next section (guide).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text is the merger column. if differences were found, shows the column the appropriate colour. if different programming languages where white signs is not so important to see the relevant changes only. (at C / C + +, B. are white signs only relevant in character strings and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the interlocking column from the text, where the respective source file does not activate any lines. if the line break is activated, the line turned into broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The windows window (among the comparison-star) also has a info-line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [changed] if you have already edited by the automatic merging them, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the Save disabled!!! (use the buttons jumps to be soldered to the same soldered / UNGELO Conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference is triggered at the same time, too.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By a click with the left mouse button in one of the window, the first line will be displayed in the windows and the first line of the group will not be visible in the beginning of the group. this group will be highlighted in the beginning of the group. this group will be highlighted and if the left is an black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, sometimes, in this line, there is no further line more in the group. this text is not indicated in this lines; No line in the queles; No line in the final stored file, nor in the final stored file, nor in a markings you may be copying and wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; competing handle; however, appears in the intermediate shelf when you copy such text from the result window. go forward with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">NOTE: when choosing the sources that options are ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or reviews are as such as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the image cartridges and the mouse, you can also use the keyboard keys left, right, high, runder, page, at the beginning, end, Ctrl-at and can also be used by other programs. the overthrow column next to the vertical image drive can be used by hinge.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other keys to work. with insertion -button you can change between insertion and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button to synchronizes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section of Merging and the editable issue date).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference, to the next / preceding conflict (Ctrl-image upwards) or to the next / preceding conflict. therefore, that's not automatically dissolved according to the manual disorders. therefore, must be resolved between dissolved and UNGELSTEN conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copy-button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion), you will also specify automatically into the clipboard and the manual copying. be with this option, for you could write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-related operating system are stored according to the accessible operating system\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line length of the source files which you should not use & kuses 3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most used files will automatically be saved at the end automatically and will be recovered at the next start. (menu adjusting &gt; KDiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (in some systems, the dialog box is also using variable width to choice, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you can activate this option, differences in short lettering. if the selected script will not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors are not available in their pure form, but would be represented in their pure form. to this systems, the button viewer automatically creates a unlock colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise it is inserted a table character.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press the input or return, the insertion of the previous line will also be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, any selection automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeiling-type you can prefer to store you prefer. the default value is the general selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When using files tries & kuses 3; first, all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source files. the second step can be ignored. the second step will not be ignored. in this step, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors'\ 'at the end of a row, but then could save files with different sizes in the end of a row, but then could save files with different sizes in the side-side-side comparison, but even as one white signs. during the merger, this option has to be disabled this option this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are displayed, but they are covered like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated this option. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after smaller subsiders. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective at complicated and large files but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Auto-Entertainment mode determines this setting as long as the result of the selection will be detained before the next UNGELO Conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolve automatic all conflicts in white signs by the chosen file as a source. if you are useful if white signs are less important. if you are aware that the automatic selection includes conflicts in numbers or comments concerning the options of ignorating or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are identified in chapter for scanning of files and perform a merger. look for details below documentation regarding the directory and merger.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a older version exists, the original version of the Suffix .original depends on such a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this is without further back.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of user interface. changing this option is not able to finish the current program. you need to finish & kdiffuse (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is adjusted on global control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if necessary this option is activated for all the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection buttons for coding is a short note that is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has a pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. these influences, as special characters and interpreting the coding for any file can be individually adjustable, even files with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can order here which coding coding for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you can define the target command, they could not work with your codec. (e.g. might be your files 16-bit Unicode, but the preventing command can only be encoded with 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do not turn off to press Heredness of changes in white signs in the text or supervision. (NOTE: this applies to changes in numbers or reviews if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you want to see three files. in normal mode, all differences in a farmer encoded column. but sometimes, you may only see the differences between two of three files; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C is indicated next to the normal time a second overthrow column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available square on the screen for long lines. easy to use the less important windows. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparing window next to each other or other. this can be useful for displays of long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and decide to execute the files. you will only compare the files from the last source file as a preset name for the output file names. (if this function is used to start the merger, the name of the last used output file will be retain.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be delivered to this external command. in & kdiffuse, the output of the command is visible, and not the file. you can use your own preventing, which allows to use your own preventing parts, or to correct interference parts or to correct the feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it was given first to the command of this external command. the edition of the command is specified only for the line of the command. you can write your own preventing command. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind is to enable the user more flexibility when using the diff Results. but most users would like to program the good even the good news. the good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preventing command for line-equally converting: sed's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'Das. * is an ergulary article in a row. the\\ 1 in the design string refers to the found text in the first clause. the\\ U converts the found text in large case.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert the possible keys (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). once you can change the list of keywords. the\\ from the $is necessary because $a special characters can be found and at the end of the line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you have to experiment with sed, you don't want to understand, and perhaps the regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support the very similar items.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of figures is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example of an additional processing command for line abuse. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Jedes character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes, you would like to perform multiple editing at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the requirements of one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use any other like e.g. perl -p -p -e 's / REGEXP / Release / Switch' All Details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal preprocessor are needed for the display and merge operations. other operations are only the data that sees the line-equal algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">NOTE: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, setting the line of the normal preprocessor-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with every function, the text is changed or differences, you can do not notice certain differences and in the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer must work in a folder many files. from this reason you can compare and together with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes an suggestion to compete; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the compute and displays the simulated changes, without they really execute,</seg>
<seg id="2364">..., selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6-button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the Compare and compilation of individual files very similar. you need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders will be used as basis, folder is used as basis. if no goal was given, is used & kdiff3; Ordner3; Ordner3.</seg>
<seg id="2367">NOTE that only the comparison of files will automatically start the merger. to start the merger, you must select the menu entry or the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While taking the folder you want to read a small news window over the current progress. if you read the file scanning, only the files are listed until then compared to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan is finished, shows & kdiffuse 3; a listenwindow with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any file of the scan is found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The Ordnerstrustructure is usually displayed. you can use a folder or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions of the subdirectories and all the subdirectories are you to install all the folder or split.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file will start and it appears to be a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folders (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type in the other files are different, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. if the merger will start automatically, you will inform about problems of this sort.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture can be seen in columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">Same as identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">The folder are regarded as identical if their own content is identical. then, the same color. at Orders, the age is unsignificant for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color schema is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a blade again, which is only green is and later when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete cels if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete capel, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, deleting the kiss if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not the same data type (e.g. if A a file and B one file is): Error: contradiance data types. such as missing objects, the result cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not the same data type (e.g. if A a file and B one file is): Error: contradiance data types. such as missing objects exist, the merchandise cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicitator is specified and if the option directories are synchronize. then choose & kdiff3; the required action is identical to both the file. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merger and the result in both files are saving. (the user can see the visible file names for the output file only B; direct after merger & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be managed and select the option New file instead of mapping (unsecure), but the same date shall be found error, but the date is identical.. Solange such mistakes, the compilation of the files can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the merger will run a file after the others. you are the status column shows Fertig, when the merger was successful, and if something unexpected, you should see a final review and see if the status is anywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the setup dialog box is chosen, KDiff3 other columns are displayed. these include the number of unsolved, solved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders compared or together).</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can lead either the just selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all mersick-promotions (also in all subfiles), you can start the merger.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no objectives specified, then it will be used in the three-folder-merge mode C as destination as the goal and when synchronizing, A and / or B will be used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a goal, please check whether all entries should be displayed in the goal of the target. there are some options through the specific entries. we will check these options to avoid unfavourable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To compose all entries: select directories in the list -menu or press F7 (the key curve). to execute the actual entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradiant data types, even more invalid merger actions exist, a message appears to select the faulty elements. you can choose a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you run all entries, the dialog window appears with the options, simulate simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you want to see what would you want to pass, without the really changes, you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiffuse 3, then leads certain actions with all entries due to. if a manual procedure is necessary (together a single file), then opens a guide window (note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start using a file, select or press F7. if you are not saved, a corresponding dialogue. then, & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiffuse 3; you will see a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you can help you to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the opportunity to select a different action for the entry or the problem to solve the problem before joining the merger.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries are individually led, noted & kdiffuse of all entries are not together. even if the result of all entries are regarded or not saved, these entries are considered as erleur. only if you want to change the merge action, these entries will once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kuses 3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3...) has now a part named directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that can be displayed in the element tree, are shown in the element tree. separate space holder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is *. folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, do not be entered in the element tree, do not use the semicolone; as a separating character. valid positions: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, do not be entered in the element tree, do not use the semicolone; as a separating character. valid positions: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that will be ignored by CVS. many autmatched files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is set to be used by .cvsignore -file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a verify -attribute. in other file systems marked a file as hide. this option lets you decide whether these files can be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched on. if the option is switched on. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to the links. this is deactivated in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched on if the option is switched on. if the option is switched on. if the option is enabled, the links like normal parts would conduct and recursiv. a link on a link would lead to a final grinding and & kuses 3; crashes.) this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistic columns. (the number dissolved, unlow and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slow as an easy binary analysis, and much slower than they contained files. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you want to compare large folder on a slow network, it is possibly faster, just the change date and file size. this speed will cost you however. please use the file. this option is based on the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the anchment date. there is no real comparison instead. the files will be considered as identical as the copy of the change date. please contact with intention. this option is based on the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronize mode if two folders compared to the merger, the suggestions will be selected so that both the file are identical. also the results from merging files are stored in both Orders. this option is stored in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If it is differently, instead of the merger, the copy of the newer file is suggested as an unsecure, because the other file is not changed. it should check this option in any case.) this option is available in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or file is replaced by another device, the original version is renamed, then the original version is renamed, this without further backup file. this is also the normal merging of single files, not only the compete folder. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder folder will be visible on the merger of single files; you can switch the window list with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window folder & text windows from the folder & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file using double click. nevertheless, there is a single file to add a single file. as soon as you can store this file, the status is set to reset, and the file will not run again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status goes lost when you want to read the directory: directory menu: Read more</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can add files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line equals a local file with an FTP server. the second command line has a folder within a compressed archive with a local file.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can not be relatively. or.. containing URLs not possible, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Leerrange- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system, sometimes the protocol used through the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be different, whether a link to a file or folder will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to work in authorized or reference date. therefore, soaking the authorization of the original. (please note the option of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose trailers is currently available as differences betweet in KDevelop. Kfivelop starts first always start the built-in differences. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then choose In KDiff3Part Show from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kuses 3; two full input files. if it is used to select a patch file in the unified format. then, & kuses 3; the names of the original files has to exist at least one of the two files. then, & kdiff3; the program patch to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the conqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiffuse 3; as part is executed, it supports only the Compare from two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the guide or the Compare in files are not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is there) there are already. also the name KDiff3 is already shown that it may lead to diffuse the program diffuse from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have much learned by using other programs in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmer which have gone down or standing him.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You did not compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will not be shared to KDE. in the default setting installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces. in the README file, you can find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs differently, these lines are available as identical; but if only one-white signs is different, the line is not identical. if you do not only one-white signs, this is the next to each other, this Dis coffe but this quis of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The Editor is intended for any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply called as text file, and it is too much effort to design extra a own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The expenditure was to be large. you can use a specific version always by using a source A / B / C. in order to process larger quantities of the text should be used to be different editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After the list of text is suddenly according to No src lenses; released and text can be deleting. what does it mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiffuse 3; uses many colors to be distinguished by differentiated. even more power would be verworse and is missing the purpose. use the other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came out of colleagues and many people from the wild wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiffuse; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You can use Kuser 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To create & kdiffuse 3; on a system with & KDE; you need to compiling and install the following command in the basic version of & kdiffuse; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder where your system is installed in the KDE. if you're unsecure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiffuse 3; autoconf and automake, you should have any problems at compile. they should occur in trouble, report on the & KDE; -mailinglist.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-removal) copied into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insertion (Strg-V or umschalt-insertion) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences in all files are identical in all files are not appear in the Ordnerstrustructure, and therefore not in the objective.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to read the folder to these options with the update update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will be displayed only to the differences that identical files at mercury. if the target file will not be copied to the target. (the behaviour is probably changed in a later program version probably changed.) This option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Please note the buttons for the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar, the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group (if they are already present). if the lines are already present, they are already installed on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is disabled. Underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a mini-show all virtual work surfaces. it's quite convenient to change its size to change their size, it works to change or to postpone. this works both within a working area as well as many.</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can create the pain, which causes the mouse and helps to use any pain. unfortunately, suffering from pain that are using your computer, you should not need a doctor if you do not happen if the use of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to adjust it again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to create pain that are caused by pain that applies to pain that applies to the mouse because of all the ergonomic tool: the result can drop to any different aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & mousetool is simple: & kmousetool; is simple: & mousetool; monitors your mouse motions and leads a mouse click away, once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent deactivates, makes & kmousetool; a break when it is pressing the mouse button. move the mouse button to pass the mouse button. the intelligent drive requires a little practice but you can get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement must be enough after the end of the mouse movement; before & kmousetool; you will get a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is an intelligent compatial clock, the rotation rate is set up (1 / 10 s), the time is set, the & kmousetool; after the herpressures the mouse back, if the mouse is no longer run, if ingestion is no evidence of the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE; add the reaction time to shortened sound & multimedia, select the sound system and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer for you to shortened to a lower value to shortened the response time.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you want to use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & KDE; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make sure to make a mouse click without effect: the clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, which does not hesitate to uncertainly reactions. you can use the mouse on such digits, until you want to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is used, you should make your mouse. that's rather simple. the trick is quite simple. the trick is not only the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball in contact.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must take out the mouse ball, as it is done, from mouse to mouse. it should be clearly clear when you watch the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you can see the castors. these are on the sides of the hole that the ball was used. the trick and the contamination can be easily with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use and move on another window bearings and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you can execute a mouse click. here is the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can rewarded as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & mousetool; continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Workaround: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to place the mouse on a neutral area of the mouse and eg. safe zones for the mouse pointer. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas of tools and menus and the cover files of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent compilation, but I don't make it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent compass is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes you to copy it to copy it into the clipboard and will move into the clicking or any other action, when you are going to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here, some are doing any advice on this way:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent compose if you just start to use & kmousetool; click here. select text instead of a mouse click here, while you turn to move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again the mouse control again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">To use the phone mouse click here. therefore, if & kmousetool you will play a sound like a mouse click. so, you can use the intelligent push-up period. later you can use the intelligent push-click with no audible click. but it is required to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest enlargement for & X window; this should be installed on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the headphones mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker, and these are correct.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for the normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is processed, before he sent to the program Speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving words or shortened words, select a matching language and speaker to choose between voice synthesions and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech-dispatcher" is working with a text. & ktts; different types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The screen Readers read the highest priority. it will be read the highest priority. if the issue of screen reader is read, the contracted orders will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor gets to hot reserved. a warning has priority, and holds the issue of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News the next priority. a message undbreaking normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that welcome messages. during you & eg; you can welcome you with & kmouth; someone pleased to welcome you the space. & KDE; messages are also news. Read More.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text yields. each job, which is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that have text applications. text boxes are intended for the edition of prolonged texts that have no particular unconditional.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order cards are processed in waiting list, except for the issue of screen Readers. if a application form the output of a screen Readers, while & ktts; just such as read, this edition will be completed and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you must know that filters never be applied to the output of screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text presentations and on & KDE; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and give him to the next filter. at the time there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are executed as modules. in the future it can still give more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character string translators replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify either as a words or as a regular expressions. & ktts; is used with predefined drawing messages from & conversation; or & kmail; or & kmail in a better shape.</seg>

<seg id="2633">With microphone selection filter, you can send the text by text or dependent on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you want to read a female voice, you can read text by KDE messages in addition to read it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has adjustable rules for which he is used for a voice edition. if the filter is not applicable, if the filter is not applicable, the text remains unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & KDE; messages sent to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters, which was set up on the page below. the processing is carried out in the order in the list above the top.</seg>

<seg id="2839">This range can not replace more knowledge via IP networks. in this appendix for basic information on the integration of the PCs in a small (home -) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 is expected to be found in near future. this description are focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign network drives, the network administrator is to be able to be a valid IP address, or if the IP address can't be selected any IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a separate small (home), the IP address should be chosen from a specially for this purpose, to avoid IP-addressing using the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, the access can access to the Internet for such machines using a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, the addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the network mask usually issued on 255.255.255.0 that all calculators are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things reserved, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is an own so-called loopback interface that works as a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2898">In front of the strip, it must first be replaced by the binding. there are three methods to do this to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change of symbol for the band, so the binding for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message. the band can now be thrown without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; be used, it must be formatted from & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A belt needs to be formatted before you can form as a tape before using & kdat. this process is necessary, before you need to formatted the band of & kdat; the floppy belt drive could not be formatted to play DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity goes & kdat; with the form of bandes. all data on the band is lost automatically! after completion of the format will automatically be bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you specify the backup process, you need to select the file files that can be made on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only secure this file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a fault profile in the tree. it will only secured the files given in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a ports. only the selected files and / or subordinates are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">As soon as the backup was redirected, the dialog for backup. in this dialogue you can check the selected files and settings for the backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog for the dialog. the dialog shows the progress of the safety process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the record for the drive. it will only checked the selected file or the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select files in one of the files in the record for the band with a bunches. there are only the selected files and / or subordination.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menentry test....</seg>
<seg id="2913">As soon as the test procedure was launched, the dialog for check. in this dialogue you can check your choice and check the working positions for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking the dialog, the dialog shows the progress of the test procedure and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can use the Recover, you must be recovered files that can be recovered on two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archive which belong to the entry for the tape drive. it will only be selected the selected file or the subordinner.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives. it will only be recovered files and / or Unterordner.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archive and choose the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">As soon as the Recover the Recover, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialogue you can check your selection and the working folder for the restore.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog shows the progress of the Reconcology and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it has been necessary to create bandindexfile using the bandinhaltes. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here is an connection profile with the just marked files and the default settings. you can take the following settings for an connection profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current position was to be done in which the backup should be updated automatically. the list of these files are automatically updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files that are only concerned in the same file system, like the folder. folders that can be set to other file systems for 1. each entry is regardless of the others regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a inkremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last inkremental file, a snapshot file will only be secured that has been changed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of file, which uses the amendment to the amendment of the last inknment backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar. this means that all files are protected and a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; gt; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can take up via the menu item KDat... in the menu settings, you can take the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device driver for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must have to prove the non-rewinding resistance of the band.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, surveal & kdat; before the tape, the command is load to the drive. in some hard drives is necessary, before read or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is enabled, the option is switched on, tries & kdat; the design at tape drive. maybe this setting not work at all bandages.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when triggering the integration of & kdat; automatically use the tape. use this option does not use the floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; the hardware error sizes for the tape drive. not all drives support variable recorders. No matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to test the blocksize for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, writing a file to the beginning of the band. this file would be just a memory block on the band. the contents of the file is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N Byte) The band-ID. the format of this character sequence is the name's format: seconds, whereby it formatted the entire name of the system, which has been formatted since the epoch in the time since the epoch.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archive that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not able to use inkable fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a safety band. this icon is only active when a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocolle. the program is for unexperienced users, where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to perform the various protocol files. Moreover, & ksystemlog; experience the fast access to information on problems that appear on their servers.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computers in the background. the program is suitable for unexperienced users; the program is for unexperienced users who can not know where you can find information on your system or where the system considers the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog; experience systemlog; experience the fast access to information about problems that provide on their servers. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some extended functions, with their help the protocol files certain programs and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 offers & ksystemlog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features include also include and will be explained in other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; features available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file is easily filtering and sort the individual ways to sort and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocoll has started. the protocol files are usually started using Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal users don't have any authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar in order to fit selected filters. in the default setting, the selection box will be displayed automatically, so the protocol line will only be displayed, if in one of the columns the string, the options of the filter search options are included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can choose to select another entry in this place, select one another entry in the protocol file system protokoll will select the column process, and carry out in the filter bar the names of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors will be displayed with a minimum statement as a protocol lines. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocoll or in Cron Protocol), you can still be useful if you want to check the output of a specific command as for example for the launch of the Samba server. in this case, you want to use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can activate the option to view the new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all the latest protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-star. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open an additional sub-window, select the menu for the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more information on the reference from & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & KDE; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv; do.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init develops up to the standard for control of program starts at the high-drive system in the & Linux; world. and therefore because it is easier to use, powerful and flexible more flexible as the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not return on the Historical Aspects (e.g. because I do not know about it knows: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is therefore important, because perhaps one could try to record one machine on system V init, without any reinstallation and reformal. why do you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init differs from BSD init that the configuration files in a subordinances of / etc are used directly in / etc. this file called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional file:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole amount of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to run on another runlevel. system services do not such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not such things like setserial, which will only be started once again. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down below / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there are not much use for this file, you can do not want to do something like to do something like to do what with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init, and starts the first that he takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standarest runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see the following line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can design a look into the second column and probably that you would like to perform it / etc / inittfrom by hand, then you can repair all of your hand, then you can repair all of the system, then you will repair all the system restart the system and then execute the system:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it get all the right skripte? if you enter -l enter rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that the folder doesn't have any correct files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it work and stops all system services? very simple: each of Skripte is thus written, that it accepts a argument like start and stop. you can start this script of hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the names, and if the one includes a K, the script will be called with the argument stop, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish you to set a simple way, machines for many purposes; I could run only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; you can run even a user -Runlevel, das & etc; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv;. it should not difficult to be very difficult because the program is done as an friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another zeigester is easy to say trivial: draw a entry from the avable system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change skripte also between Runlevelling or the position within one levels when they go wounded. this is the entry of its original runlevel (or his position), but this happens if they move an entry from the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">NOTE: how to copy these in a new zone when you want to copy these in a new runlevel, you need to choose copy from the menu or from the context menu and even in the target range insertion -- even then if the same entry already exists in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorrow's number is sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to use the sorting numbers of the converted entries before you can try to use the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">NOTE: there is no option to restore the entries that were thrown into the paper bin. be so insured.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator -button to activate the various working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a choice of top- or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add him in the desired round level with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow or the name of a clocking or the name button to open the dialog box to accept the dialog box to accept the dialog button to accept the modifications to accept the amendments to accept the amendments to accept the amendments to accept the amendments to accept the amendments.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu click a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. Preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise they are produced by & ksysv; played by the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have been experimented with the standard Runlevelling, and now starts the machine to new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then you will work the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel on a sensible value (3 should be normally in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services using & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Dye (DLD) then you need to work additional files in / etc, which are only available in this distribution. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, like system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary integration programmes of this distribution, but unfortunately, but is a standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension of this approach to this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: check if all configuration files are needed (and also whether they are needed in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) just make sure your configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varied from distribution can be different from version to version different. if you want to use a different distribution, please send us more information about the runlevel to be accessed this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's enough to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have taken changes, you have to save this saving. either use the appropriate symbol of toolbar or the entry saving in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user list. select the desired users or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user - or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have expanded system settings. only if you need to execute a card card, if Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd such as BSD-Unixen are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card item is released, otherwise Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd such as BSD -Unixen are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This cardboard card will be activated only if for at least one-undated filesystem (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognition at the file ratia.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be changed for each user parameters where the space restrictions can be changed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">This parameter can be set separately for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Map-card groups informs about the group of selected user. the standard group that belongs to the users, you can find in the field of prime group. continue to mark the user in other groups by clicking these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog for the Group contains a list of all users to add a user to add this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or to add a group, select the menu user or group or click on matching the matching button button. the Edit or deleting the selected user and the selected group will work with analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">Using this module you can add the LILO-BootManager, remove the boot password, remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove standard operating system, remove, changing systems, changing, and more.</seg>
