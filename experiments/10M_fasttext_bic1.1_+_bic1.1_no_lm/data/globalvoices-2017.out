although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is great great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , American authors read and is operated in American music .
in fact , this country had a der@@ aff@@ air impact effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journ@@ alist .
when 14 @-@ year old I saw the great D@@ enzel Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terri@@ ble rep@@ orter who had covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura student of an oil magn@@ ets , who wanted to find his interest in his interest .
I was cau@@ ght .
Free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , when the absolute truth is , forget anything else that I would like to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened me for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only land that I have ever lived there , whose diversity is so that thou art , and it is light and it is easy Ac@@ cept@@ ance in a community of equal people .
I had even got a very weak Lieb@@ es@@ letter on his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much was written about the tourist @-@ person@@ ality and the bre@@ ast@@ ism of this man .
the extraordinary aspect of its asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with its Eng@@ face .
he stops his opinion behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful .
he says exactly what he think , like a former colle@@ ague it was ex@@ press@@ ly called for Mus@@ li@@ ms , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people have re@@ acts on his statements and stri@@ ped for him .
the 13 million voices , which won in the Republi@@ can court , was the highest number , which ever reached from the party nom@@ ini@@ um .
I was speaking .
who are the Americ@@ ans who support these big@@ a person ?
I could do Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers not bring together with people in harmon@@ y , which I had to know during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ al@@ is@@ mus@@ program , the people from all over the world , a deep glori@@ ous man that could cause me about Islam and its past .
in addition , Tr@@ um@@ ps World Champion won &apos;t agre@@ e with the publisher by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met ourselves to our common love for bas@@ ketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix Sun@@ s &quot; in the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also established in contrast to the gener@@ osity , which I strug@@ gl@@ es with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , and her husband died , and her husband , my host family , who had treated me as their son .
it fits on the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with many pati@@ ence and cour@@ age me and my colleagues helped us to get to the complex@@ ity of the American life .
then , Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kathr@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who has helped me much with my career .
these people and caused by them enc@@ omp@@ osed my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump had its way to nom@@ ini@@ zed Republi@@ can presid@@ ential candidates , they asked me a grip and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , more than 50 million Americ@@ ans , mostly white , the presid@@ ency of a man , despite - or maybe even because of his hom@@ age against non @-@ white people .
the idea was chosen with the idea that people have been designed for Tr@@ ump , because they were dep@@ loyed in his r@@ ass@@ ism and Fan@@ at@@ ism , because they were ready to do these things in me almost the heart .
perhaps it is impossible to record the Tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as a r@@ assi@@ sts .
people are en@@ rich@@ ed , said , one of my friends , is exactly what is led to this situation .
this is more surface and resp@@ ectable and interpre@@ t an un@@ capability to understand to understand a different kind and fashion .
it shows the people that their car@@ es and change about the h@@ ecti@@ c changes in their municip@@ alities are not taken into account .
could it be that this vot@@ ers , of which most know are tun@@ ed for Tr@@ ump , because they would like control over a country that have dis@@ appointed them ?
with other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , you can &apos;t forget the words by David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who made the cru@@ el decision to bring a man who looks at those who looks different look .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( an@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; elim@@ ination of past@@ ries against any other eth@@ ernet &quot; ; voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ tery at the past@@ ures and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , what makes the big Van Jones called what makes it so great .
million people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a charming idea - which faith or background are always like to do America every welcome .
because this land is selected as his Presid@@ ents , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , where he would be possible in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America of this promise to and says : to Hell with vers@@ ation , religious freedom and all the concept of Pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America , after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rest@@ ore , say they say .
in all that I think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldiers who fell in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with human consumption .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Mus@@ li@@ ms a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot; bur@@ nished the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot; answered them . &quot;
A@@ fr@@ o Americ@@ ans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot; left them and their voices were lau@@ gh .
&quot; would any one that is not so how to make a place in your Americas ? &quot;
he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and excellent &quot; N@@ ON &quot; !
Mr. Khan joined with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was reported .
the country that had fallen to his son , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find out more space in this new America .
and I breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of Cat@@ e@@ ura in the province of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played on both locations , not only the life of children changed , but also a very close connection with ...
Music , who lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large waste dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colon@@ ial town that is popular among tourists , but wor@@ lds away from the nearby pre@@ domin@@ ant ruins and its world famous kitchen .
since a couple of years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) plays an opportunity for children and adults are an opportunity to over@@ come with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students is to become the central interest for the church of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Gu@@ ardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the most of the provinc@@ es of Mexican , is known for their drugs ab@@ use and the Ban@@ ff violence .
but changed this after a random meeting with a French pil@@ ots that started a musical project and Youth , as a rare ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ man .
the young band members take their oblig@@ ations towards the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch race they go through the dust roads to go by their great passion .
they come and with brilliant eyes on and play in the bust@@ le day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
Music from Mü@@ ll
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is prac@@ tically at the largest waste dump of As@@ unc@@ i@@ ón in Par@@ agu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are made from restored waste material :
Music with restored instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ v@@ ez started to turn parts of the case in instruments .
the instruments im@@ per@@ ate , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double bass@@ es , gu@@ itars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trombones and percussion , which were all from fatigue .
the re@@ per@@ toire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin music as well as music by the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ v@@ ez , a local Ö@@ col@@ o@@ ge and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning of time :
first it was very difficult , because we had no space for samples and we had to contact the parents in the labour , The children &apos;s bur@@ ned no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen : an accident damaged violin .
today there is a complete orchestra that plays on instrument by instruments and who calls the Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentation of the &quot; Land@@ sc@@ Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic waste dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rubb@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him live as the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Par@@ agu@@ ay .
and here they turn it into something .
Land@@ ing Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspired Schau@@ spiel from Mü@@ ll @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully obtained the il@@ legal fishing plant
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that made the wild @-@ leg@@ ally fish@@ eries .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that developed over international , pract@@ ising solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of Content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had been carried out in Leban@@ ese waters of il@@ leg@@ alen , before it att@@ empt@@ ed to att@@ empt@@ ed the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were brought against this way and incl@@ ined , a bill of these species to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Se@@ ych@@ elles . they ref@@ used to use their har@@ bo@@ urs and ref@@ used to use a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the Premier surrounded by countries that you can simply mar@@ ched by Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a sen@@ ior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship time and persec@@ uted .
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not law@@ ful to catch the fish .
ulti@@ mat@@ ely , it was also given to pay 2 million dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ ating the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative that protects the c@@ min@@ als prac@@ tices and resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop il@@ legal F@@ ishing ( il@@ leg@@ ale fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Som@@ alia and Madagas@@ car the six countries that were distributed over the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are simultaneously co@@ sting and work together . they are ro@@ ve information from where it is going to il@@ leg@@ ally fish@@ eries , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding il@@ legal F@@ ishing . this project provides FISH @-@ i technical support .
il@@ legal fishing is un@@ regul@@ ated by definition : what is it is hidden , it is hidden because of it is extremely difficult , because of il@@ legal fishing is a main cause of the regions .
by the ab@@ ated ab@@ normal@@ ities of the laws , which are protected by certain hab@@ it@@ ats and species , the il@@ legal fishing ec@@ os@@ ystem , which have a del@@ ik@@ y equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
but during actions against the il@@ leg@@ al fish , once were dis@@ ed with bu@@ ro@@ k@@ rat@@ ous hur@@ dle , and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , to pass the actions in real time , so it will pass the actions in real time , with trac@@ eable to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital commun@@ al platform .
for example , individual countries can exchange together with each other existing licenses , news to ver@@ ify activities or details that had notic@@ ed during a tut@@ orial or more .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very att@@ enti@@ ve , when they move these on the open lake , using satellite TV .
this enables to mark the authorities , ships to identify the authorities , dis@@ pleased to discover in hidden areas - about such that a ship dis@@ charges the fish on other ships to other ships .
in ide@@ al@@ ments can show such investig@@ ations whether they have been participating ships a fishing licence , where they were on the way and may have a penalty .
countries that are subj@@ ected to il@@ leg@@ alen fish . what means that the ships can &apos;t sell their load in their har@@ bo@@ urs . and that they can even be used to pay their load , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; it is then substanti@@ al financial losses for the owners who means that the il@@ legal fishing were not financ@@ ed anymore .
and that &apos;s what we want to reach , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a cons@@ ulting firm that assi@@ sted by il@@ legal fish@@ eries in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win at least 20 million USD in order to win the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year , because of il@@ leg@@ ally fish@@ erm@@ en , lost in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most produc@@ tive t@@ una fish , which is essential for the region of commercial fish@@ eries from all over the world . among these also lo@@ bst@@ ruc@@ ture fish@@ erm@@ en .
among its prac@@ tices including actions , as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license paper , stated by ph@@ asi@@ en@@ amen , fishing protected species and fish in nature con@@ servation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the missing international cooperation and make the we@@ ak@@ ness of an in@@ less organic control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier was a ship il@@ legal and a country could say &apos; You should not run my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ally att@@ empt@@ ed to close it at FISH @-@ i .
to date the closed front will work .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 different ships .
it has ch@@ ri@@ min@@ ated networks , which had counter@@ f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships that have several neg@@ l@@ ent identity and it has been pursu@@ ed ships and found .
based on his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , can share FISH @-@ i information about il@@ legal fishing .
&quot; some of our investig@@ ations lead us quite far in the networks organised crimes &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
it builds a system that help the FISH @-@ i will be more precise .
photo cour@@ tesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , helps to hide the il@@ legal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; the il@@ leg@@ alen Fischer are very refin@@ ed techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat tr@@ acking , a N@@ RO that offers fish with fish@@ eries data and FISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships used to switch their automatic identification systems , which they do not want more of satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information related to each other . it should help FISH @-@ i with greater precision .
a model program
but FISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can really influence on the dou@@ bt global problem of il@@ leg@@ ally fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Team , believed that .
recently , Sky@@ pe has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Se@@ e@@ ana Platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite TV and can be displayed by each individual ship &apos;s position worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neigh@@ bo@@ urs with neigh@@ bo@@ urs to get a better picture of it , who does this makes just sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to destroy and their resources . &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; PE@@ W Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run on a global system the tr@@ acking of ships .
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only open@@ able , but they also ab@@ str@@ ate .
ships that previously used before without license and hardly any consequences did we know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating FISH @-@ i participating countries have a 33 % increase of fish sales since then fishing boats has to buy more lic@@ ences .
after FISH @-@ i som@@ alia , Gre@@ ko had taken up , and they found the insp@@ ectors there on board to@@ pp@@ net@@ ze , whose application is b@@ anned .
photo cour@@ tesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice this achiev@@ ements . &quot; &quot; the effect is similar that us now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually through il@@ legal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have closed to the so @-@ called West Africa T@@ ask Force . also the il@@ legal fishing , after exactly the same model such as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the target to make even more such initi@@ atives and structures to other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Som@@ alia had its first great tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the ship , and not only was the ship without licence , which were b@@ anned by now .
the ship was also reserved in forbidden area that are reserved for fish@@ erm@@ en from Som@@ alia . &quot; &quot; with the rules of measure against Gre@@ ko 1 was the strong character that they have to go against il@@ leg@@ alen fishing . &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
for FISH @-@ i , this is a further success of many . and at the same time that a sol@@ ely special , collab@@ orative project works for the protection of oc@@ e@@ ans really works in the entire world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journ@@ alist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and n@@ utrition .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced to escape the atro@@ cities in La Perl@@ a , a secret prison in the Argentine City of Cordoba .
as the adult man said Qu@@ ij@@ ano in the frame of the big La Perl@@ a @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the Province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial began on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dict@@ ator@@ ship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not been search@@ ed for his life .
at the Bür@@ de , den@@ same name like his father , as the brut@@ al military operations in prison La Perl@@ a , who observed his age at the age of 15 .
he held this family home for 34 years .
in the situation , I believed that this was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ical .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t know that it is man@@ ip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my Father has been a th@@ ief , tort@@ ure and mort@@ ar .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dict@@ ator@@ ship , from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State ror@@ ism , his father was dep@@ uty Commander 141 in prison La Perl@@ a .

but this is not the history of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the supp@@ ress because of Ent@@ führung in 158 cases , tort@@ ure , murder in almost 100 cases and the de@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
No , this is the history of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced in the course of the years , who had experienced a boy in the years before a Federal Court against his own father .
its history shows which great power is a parents about his child , and how this child chose a way to the salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I went with us into the sports hall . there I had hi@@ red me with a boy , the com@@ bat sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me on my friend on my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have rounded you with one of the ER@@ P .
pass blo@@ oming that they lead you not a day , and I have to save you .
the short@@ cut ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revolution@@ i@@ ario del Pu@@ eblo , - Revolu@@ tion@@ aries &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go again into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation thought that I would be fine . for so my Father had told me .
on the military base , I had decided to destroy the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university agreements , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ anda material , books , simply everything .

my father took me a total of four times after La Perl@@ a - everything in 1976 .
during the first and during the last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he participated in the second time he commanded me to get to me . he led me to a bar@@ n , in the car , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just all possible .
all of it was st@@ olen .
he gave me a little in a blank@@ et , and commanded me to bear the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in silver .
at this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ley where the st@@ olen objects were moved and held me with a guard .

since dr@@ ills the pris@@ oner will be det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated .
I wo@@ unded , and looked a li@@ ege who were tor@@ tured on people .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it was at the end of a cable . the other end has been fixed at the body of the person who had stopped there .

the rock in there was ast@@ on@@ ished ... how a dir@@ ty wind@@ el .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same sm@@ ell went out of his room .
I knew the sm@@ ell immediately and me became clear that the sm@@ ell of a body in trouble .
I never forget this sm@@ ell .
and I asked me , How is it only possible that man can do another so much bodies ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the field where the prisoners were treated with hand@@ ker@@ age and were treated .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civ@@ ilians who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a range of matt@@ resses , on which n@@ aked men with the face to bottom - all were treated at hands and feet .
close to the entrance people still still on the matt@@ resses .
when my Father noted that I saw to the pris@@ oner , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , Ass@@ bl@@ ong ? &quot;
why did you come to me ? why have you brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were dis@@ card@@ ed and buried in a pit and was buried .
I know that my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were design@@ ated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man st@@ ruck a man and sle@@ w .
( according to survival of survival , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was indic@@ ted to death in La Perl@@ a @-@ Ri@@ bera , who was also indic@@ ted to death the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death .
in the following video , Em@@ ilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the Memorial La Perl@@ a , through the former fol@@ klore chambers .
the way which you come here , is also the way which came down on the way .
if you see on the map , you see that they took about this way , and then for the first time .
here their names were changed and they re@@ ferred to as part of the process of the dec@@ ree a number .
when they survi@@ ved the tort@@ ure , the prisoners were thro@@ wn into cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came , that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for creating man and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible sleep things with home .
at that time I had no idea of what the &quot; war &quot; - how it was called it .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ arm@@ erie - I was clear that war p@@ utting a bay@@ onet or perhaps military police , which one fell on a enemy that they were ash@@ amed .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , clothing , painting , money ... pins , then the no mar@@ ti@@ pping yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is the@@ ft .
I &apos;ve asked me , as my father , the leader of the security forces to do with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ arm@@ erie and I would never like to ste@@ al in a house .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and thou that you can handle on the street .
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded against v@@ w , sm@@ ote me , and cried out :
if you come so far , I will find you and bring thee stand .
to do we need any other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on whom I had a jacket , and a roll swe@@ ater out wool . both had my father from La Perl@@ a .
we were not poor but he brought clothes at home .
at that time , the defence decided to have been a co @-@ dis@@ appeared in this crime . I said , no problem , they can send me to the burden which they wanted .
I was something to cut out there .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ k is the last one of the last act &apos;
now , where I am older , I am Reu@@ e .
I have children . if one has only children , recogni@@ ze the value of a life .
it was developed and det@@ ects that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have asked if the dict@@ ator@@ ship was ex@@ iled , but why did not dis@@ appear ?
why do children feed ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this little girl was .
I introduced me again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they sl@@ ain ?
you would have to bring it to j@@ ail .
I estimate , it was simply decided to kill these people . and what to make their body dis@@ appear ?
did these people do not even families who was handed over to the remains of the remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ k is the last one who can do people to do one man .
my father told me when the democ@@ racy was introduced to elim@@ inate her machines to elim@@ inate the remains of the prisoners .
they have been in@@ hal@@ ved and somew@@ here there - no idea where . &quot; I will never find something , &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but anything remains natural .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to make it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the G@@ end@@ arm@@ erie .
I have just said the truth about 20 k@@ ri@@ min@@ elle - including my father .
the idea to show my father , was formed during a meeting when he was under house arrest .
I did him forward to see him because of all the gre@@ etings which I had to see ?
then he said , &quot; I know not . I have none were killed .
I felt gl@@ azed and asked me what over@@ come Patri@@ ot@@ ismus and the &quot; Western and Christian fe@@ el@@ ings , who alle@@ ge@@ dly def@@ ended , actually well .
then I cried out :
how can you say to me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have terri@@ ble crimes committed me , and you have forced me as a child .
he said only &quot; Na then &quot; I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just what did I did .
in 2010 I ref@@ unded the first display .
I finally had been recognis@@ ed that he was a bre@@ ast@@ y .
No one can say to me that I have re@@ make vo@@ id . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest in house arrest .

a translation errors do older people in Kyoto to &quot; fur@@ y car drivers &quot;
the shield with the translation error in Kyoto , in which one can extend to a driver .
the picture has been wides@@ pre@@ ad in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto of Kyoto , customers of a newly built Center in which one can extend to its leadership in the last month witnesses of a very particularly aggressive translation .
on a sign the Japanese word in je@@ alo@@ j@@ es ( ko@@ rei@@ d@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older car drivers &quot; means , but maybe even with B@@ ös@@ em Hinter@@ dan@@ ken &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; terri@@ ble car driver . &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic displays in the input range and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into the social media .
the mist@@ akes was the trans@@ lat@@ ors Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os , and he was also to att@@ enti@@ ve the local time .
in Kyoto @-@ appar@@ ent daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this indicates that no one has read the translation of correction .
this is an aff@@ ordable for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simple un@@ accept@@ able , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the def@@ ective English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terri@@ ble drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terri@@ ble auto@@ drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the reas@@ onable when also gram@@ mat@@ isch is not very correct &quot; Elder beermn &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto . still declared that the error was already in the text that they were not checked in the text , and that the translation was not checked out of the translation before it was released .
a Tut@@ orial report as follows :
&quot; it &apos;s right to know that el@@ derly people through the in@@ adequ@@ ate correction ( the translation ) of our Lord , said the police .
the Japanese online news @-@ service J @-@ Cast news set some more detailed with the phen@@ om@@ enon of the &quot; terri@@ fic &quot; older motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ ble &quot; was used as an un@@ reas@@ onable description of older motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts . according to the police there are the proportion of older motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts who are w@@ ast@@ es in acc@@ id@@ ents , but through reason for sor@@ rows .
in the Kyoto , Kyoto , in 2005 , 1,@@ 941 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accident of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , a total of 11,@@ 850 acc@@ id@@ ents were caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 .
thus , your share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of acc@@ id@@ ents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ ior citi@@ zen have risen cr@@ ashes in the same period .
the nam@@ ely did not called Re@@ porter , published on Yahoo version of the article in the light that demonstr@@ ates some Japanese drivers for earlier drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is it the ( &quot; ven@@ e@@ eping drivers &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So the translation is not really not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I can &apos;t find that this is a real translation mist@@ ake . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is wides@@ pre@@ ad throughout Asia ?
translation errors are wides@@ pre@@ ad in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure gru@@ b for these bi@@ zar@@ re errors in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation are diverse .
for over@@ time you need two important cap@@ abilities : passive voice provi@@ ders to understand the output text to understand the starting text in order to trans@@ mit him in the target language .
this is it requires the active behavi@@ or of the target language - something that is considered the trans@@ ferr@@ ing that trans@@ lat@@ ors in the target language - not in the final language - mother @-@ speaking languages .
for example , a French mother tongue was transl@@ ating from English into French French transl@@ ator - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies emplo@@ y no employees with English as the native language , the translations into English language could be translated into English , cost reasons or relatively small number of English par@@ ent languages that can learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees , however , translations are non@@ eth@@ eless . then , the Japanese people will be considered as the best data , for trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how well or bad his language knowledge is really good .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also wides@@ pre@@ ad - often with fun@@ ny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and lim@@ entary pro@@ ph@@ r@@ ases that will show through machine translations , that this technology can replace no human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to several languages .
some of the st@@ range of English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also tast@@ eful re@@ prints , often do T @-@ sh@@ irts or pockets are only be used by st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation error is yet accept@@ able or at least har@@ m@@ less . but of great companies or from the government , which have to guarantee the average , higher standards can expect more carefully .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : Prot@@ ests and C@@ ens@@ ur@@ measures on the Internet and TV
enter the main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar , Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ NS@@ A y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , 7th of April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they had no access to the online transmitter of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , another user wrote that the Internet took part of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV as well accessible .
other Online @-@ transmitters were also covered by the prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as , which were organised by op@@ positi@@ on@@ elles in Carac@@ as , which transl@@ ate Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the prot@@ ests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court rej@@ ects the Parliament and transferred the Parliament on the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journ@@ alist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . it po@@ inted out that the connection is , and recom@@ men@@ ds the user , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .

the local N@@ GO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that no more Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible via a rej@@ ection of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two further online transmitters . this also concern@@ ed the website , which is also transferred to the National Assembly .
earlier released of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela states that the local websites used to use the DNS website . this is a technique that comm@@ erci@@ alized by the DNS server qu@@ eries of certain domains .
if an internet site is determined by the DNS server , the server is broken or ref@@ used the request to the call of such Internet page .

Flores was defe@@ ated during police in police .

in Par@@ agu@@ ay , many girls will become s@@ la@@ av@@ ans to get a training

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a short report of Kur@@ dish , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices by the authors of authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying Co@@ he , random schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a budget , in which they had not lived together with the family which lived there .
just before her study at the University , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pri@@ de on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
those who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as cri@@ mp to work in Par@@ agu@@ ay , more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to walk to school .
the shop is quite simple : a great family with little money transfer their minor son or her decrease of daughter to another young family . in the sw@@ ap the child &apos;s food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned that the children of count@@ less days have to be paid , which will never be paid and victims of ab@@ use and Mis@@ er@@ ections , and all that can &apos;t be lifting within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifting .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , this as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is wides@@ pre@@ ad in Par@@ agu@@ ay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of the company and despite numerous compl@@ aints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ation of their study , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived some years for an organization that f@@ ought for the rights of boys and girls .
she said to Cri@@ me , especially young girls are affected by the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go practice - gather@@ ing witness , and p@@ ran@@ ged from the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
they tried to con@@ vic@@ ing things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude , which is int@@ enti@@ ve to cri@@ mp@@ ing the cri@@ mp , guaranteed in general we@@ ep .
&quot; Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double val@@ leys , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one of the family that her daughter in faith , that they can improve their training in society that they can improve their position in society , and &quot; a little family can be transferred to another family .
on the other side , the family sees the girls in himself , and whose explo@@ itation with faith is just@@ ified that they would have no education , who would have no education , and maybe even though it would be un@@ tar@@ get@@ ed .
victims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl is missing , his family will see only many years later .
sometimes it even experienced it .
in January 2016 , the phen@@ om@@ enon was relatively un@@ known phen@@ om@@ enon , which takes place in the Al@@ or@@ gen@@ en in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an house , but a face .
as a Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú gained her body , showed her body tracks . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former day of Tom@@ ás Ferreira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , which is working as a civil servants at the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in a small town located in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometres east of As@@ unc@@ i@@ ón .
end of January 2016 , Ferreira sol@@ ange with one floor on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered a f@@ atal inj@@ uries .
this should be the last pun@@ ishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reports on the inc@@ ident .
she bet@@ s that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ b .
organizations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go in the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as a modern shape of s@@ la@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came together to prot@@ esters and required that there is no further Carolina &quot; in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
the name of the girl and photos were wides@@ pre@@ ad in the social media .
in Par@@ agu@@ ay there are more c@@ ows than children registered , &quot; be@@ aten Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ated the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under the conditions , boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bo@@ urs of the married couples and almost 60 zi@@ v@@ il@@ legal organizations are required a gener@@ ous investigation .
they want , that Tom@@ ás Ferreira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín Direc@@ tional compl@@ eting - when for the first time in the history of Par@@ agu@@ ay , a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is in court .
the everyday life of Cri@@ ad@@ ita
cri@@ mp are not only considered as working forces , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the col@@ ik , in which their father worked , and her father loved his work .
your brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unc@@ i@@ ón .
in the house of their emplo@@ yer worked al@@ var@@ eng@@ a between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you remained at the end time .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their emplo@@ yers .
on Fri@@ days for example , they clean@@ ed the fridge , the living room , polished furniture and the infected in the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
ever she was done with the runner , the more time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to do dinner for their emplo@@ yers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a tells you , but never had never hung@@ ry , but also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the house of the house bro@@ ok as a meal from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the rul@@ er , a former military and s@@ ymp@@ ath@@ y of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liber@@ al party , who had belonged to the dict@@ ator@@ ship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged from 1954 to 1989 .
at some even@@ ings in the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him , and conduc@@ tors from Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ers such as &quot; Send@@ ero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eblo &quot; to read more .
he att@@ empt@@ ed to con@@ vince them to con@@ vince the official media of the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
he held it for intelligent , but did not pray with her . &quot; the house of our house had heard someone who heard that he spoke about polit@@ ics , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; they allow me not often to visit my family , because they knew that I would have heard there again &quot; poor inc@@ ident that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ gen@@ ous group of Guar@@ ani , at home again .
her lord fe@@ ared the education that they might have to lose her , but it would expl@@ ain it .
she was completely clear that they had paid for everything that they had paid from them , with her hard work .
also in the school was dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is nearly never spoken , Mo@@ bb@@ ing and the Sch@@ ik@@ ans are susp@@ ended when they go to school .
because the other children have their parents know , they know that one who has no parents , who is no cri@@ ita .
I could not invite you to me at home . I had no friendship premium at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where gir@@ ders arise , I notic@@ ed especially much that I belonged to any group .
the isolation was the wor@@ st of everything , explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook Group in order to share a job for cleaning service and child@@ hood in Par@@ agu@@ ay .

reb@@ ate writes Egyptian Ministry of Social Media to register at the government during the government

six@@ ty Egyptian par@@ liamentary elections were recently added to the Reg@@ ulations concerning the regul@@ atory and user of soci@@ alist Net@@ works . &quot;
when he accepted by par@@ liament , the social media have to register for social media in Egypt , to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law would then set a place that was commissioned to use citi@@ zens@@ hip and citizens a permission to use social media .
within six months with acceptance of the legislation on the website of the site with its real name and number of numbers register to use social networks .
if it will have to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in j@@ ail or a fine of fine .

that could mean that Egypt plans to be a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . due to those of them would have to be asked for the Egypti@@ ans and Egypti@@ ans to access to the network access to the network .

my opinion , they are so that the same as they can control physical public and private rooms also online .
if I contact them , then it means that they apply a strong surveillance system to ass@@ ay citizens , or not . and this means a ver@@ ification system to monitor the activities of people and also to perform a court process .
this is techn@@ ically true re@@ alist@@ ically - but in Egypt is all possible .
in order to be approved by the law , the draft must be discussed at the legisl@@ ative of the par@@ liament and the constitu@@ tion of the constitu@@ tional compl@@ eting in the plenary process .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o daily appar@@ ent to re@@ build the progress in the last six years that were affected by the three @-@ fold dis@@ aster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a Atom accident in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a had dis@@ posed the cat@@ astrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , situated in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a member of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neigh@@ b@@ ors pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to dis@@ missed the ts@@ un@@ ami of the land hand .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a pre@@ f@@ ecture of a atom@@ ic accident , already had to leave the houses of 160 000 inhabitants , they had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o show out of local view that progress in local view , six years have been achieved to re@@ build the life of local local tax .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the subject itself .
the housing situation in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( fre@@ est@@ yle , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the largest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses , such as Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a has reached 70 percent of the final light .
even though , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el , Ev@@ ak@@ u@@ pted of Beh@@ avi@@ j@@ ak@@ u in the final subst@@ itu@@ res , even six years .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw in Beh@@ avi@@ our .
in December 2016 more than 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such groups .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a were still live in emerg@@ ing , whi@@ in@@ against Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i were still very successful , which were secured after the Des@@ aster in Beh@@ y@@ ag@@ i , which were secured after the Des@@ aster in Beh@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper could mean 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by accident until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i is now in operation , in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , only 30 percent of fishing equipment were res@@ umed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ are accident , have moved into the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural agricultural agricultural agricultural areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , where only 66 per cent of the A@@ ck@@ erl@@ andes in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a .
it &apos;s un@@ likely that only a result of the atom@@ ic is because only 690 hectares of over 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ ck@@ erl@@ ingen of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , lie in the &quot; nu@@ k@@ le@@ ar lock . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has recovered again , but there will be Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a far back here .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again at 90 percent at the same stand as before the accident . Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a can be seen here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper also reported that since the cat@@ astrophe is almost half of the coast , it is more difficult to earn their lifetime .
is the native population on the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total phot@@ ograph , the newspaper took part numerous findings under the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ation . she asked them over the status of the res@@ urrection , and also , as you have received the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction of the article explains the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o introduced a survey by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami sci@@ ousness under the native population in experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the ort@@ unity , measures had prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respond@@ ents that is still not enough in terms of cat@@ ast@@ ers prevention .
as it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a
in their issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a .
Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a had to experience only the massive earthquake and the dev@@ ast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a was also witness of the wor@@ st , cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ols , atom@@ ic accident , who had to see Japan .
from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , there were almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , in lasting replacement houses .
after the 2017 of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a live outside of their hom@@ eland pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas , which are still in Beh@@ avi@@ our , who are still in Beh@@ avi@@ our , because the effort for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a must be consi@@ stent with massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if you &apos;re looking for people from other countries that speak a different language , and the differences are initially greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while they often know that a more combines more than it seems to the first sight .
these global connections are important that they expand our prec@@ eding parts , our persp@@ ectives and re@@ mind us that the world is finally very small .
in this epis@@ ode of In@@ to the Deep , Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let us look forward to this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast treatments , we will earn less attention when they des@@ er@@ ve .

the villages of the Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Ál@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso cle@@ ared almost hundreds of sugar be@@ ings in the whole of Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ equ@@ e , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish breeding mill - known that there is no not@@ able sugar be@@ ings in front of place .
it is two years ago when the activities were manufactured in the sugar cane fac@@ tories .
after creating the sugar pipe industry in the region still , and the factory lost after and to its installations , until only the sm@@ ashed out of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be found .
some re@@ sel@@ dom the work .
others re@@ signed and p@@ end@@ eln daily to the fac@@ tories which is still possible .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who is in every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis is not smo@@ oth@@ ed in the sugar pipe industry .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane , which are once more in@@ active time in operation because they were obtained .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene remin@@ ds right , that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would not be kept , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar pipe industry has already sett@@ led in the pl@@ agues , the case of Soci@@ alism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , poor board dec@@ isions and climate change .
in 2016 , production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the message would have been a motif for a demonstration for the country , but the har@@ vest@@ ments have no longer ob@@ tain@@ ing anymore .
why the Cub@@ an Zu@@ cker@@ Tube Industry was switched off ?
the old railway tracks of the church have already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the conf@@ usion of sugar pipe was a economic need : the 155 sugar be@@ ings were techn@@ ically grown , and hardly compet@@ itive have been un@@ able for the country .
initial idea was to focus on the most efficient fac@@ tories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the fac@@ tories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.03 Euro ) .
solution for unemployment ?
the pictures that led to such measures , the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar crisis were on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar rate returned before about one decade .
from 2017 until 2025 the price of un@@ refin@@ ed sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Land@@ ro@@ uting Persp@@ ectives , by the OECD and FAO , the Agri@@ cultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything ran good
the present day is entered with security in history , that were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fid@@ el Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ and@@ ero .
from there began the re@@ structuring of the re@@ structuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the stand@@ still came from a total of 98 sugar be@@ ings , more than 65 million people received their full housing for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane fabrik Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as Sol@@ dat , what is the closing of the factory , is the word that he is repeated at most , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respond@@ ents are not one of them that would be informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to receive a full time - working group .
prior to the first closing of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed documents , which will only be removed only regarding the parts , which would be removed from the address and the date .
all were seen from Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could cause any dis@@ miss@@ al .
from there , the respon@@ si@@ bilities and letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the proud factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot; the country had no money . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the reti@@ rement in another plant that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the rail@@ road of the factory in whose construction he helped him .
with every part that he removed he demonstrated one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work generation was removed from the best .
in many cases , no altern@@ atives have been involved in the con@@ greg@@ ations and services relating to con@@ greg@@ ations in the con@@ greg@@ ations in which they were to be created .
we will never know if during the m@@ am@@ mot@@ h address given from 21 October 2002 , the former president of the present people saw that it was guaranteed that the fac@@ tories have no more in operation since five years .

after two years the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich did change that many things , but not to better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane Factory ended or better than they began to ass@@ emble them , they also heard on , the road to as@@ sign the street also other far@@ ms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other fac@@ tories .
they have been part of the spare parts .
without satis@@ faction , there are also many young people the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not once for the feeding of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still im@@ pos@@ ant .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place , which began to work at the end of 2016 .

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to claim yourself and receive your own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with homologation of N &apos; we J@@ inan .
young people of First Nations comm@@ unities in Canada with topics that are important for them . they are done by Hip Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ inan tour , since 2014 workshop manager mobile Ton@@ studios directly to schools and adol@@ esc@@ rit@@ es , to att@@ empt@@ ing young people s@@ ong@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the P@@ äd@@ ag@@ ogen David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec with ten Cre@@ e comm@@ unities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars together .
the workshop increases that the young participant in the discussions are such as &quot; cultural identity , language , self @-@ acting , love , self @-@ accept@@ ing &quot; or what they are still in mind .
these questions are in@@ spiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations comm@@ unities in the Canadian Province of British Columbia and was invited to organ@@ ise three workshops with the trunk of Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa &apos; Y@@ oo in the area of the Chief of the kit@@ es@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia is called the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of Tr@@ änen , to almost two do@@ zen most indi@@ gen@@ ous young women dis@@ appeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were not resol@@ ved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation is used as important as important of the video game , as important of the content of traditional Sit@@ ten and customs of influ@@ ences through the global@@ isation .
many of the songs were published in indi@@ gen@@ ous languages , although the young people did not mut@@ ually mature in the languages of the First Nations in mut@@ iny language .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation will be sung to Cre@@ e .
the participating adol@@ esc@@ ents received a little help by Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group who gave them a stro@@ ph@@ e in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ inan , the Stro@@ ph@@ e is available in circulation , as well as a translation in the English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel that there is none ever for me .
but I try to go on Earth for my days
that is the day that you will take to our ter@@ ror .
because we have lost our way to our life in life
but I think that we will be waiting for us a day .
I do not want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and as well as our youth .
so , they can do what the Creator can be determined
in the comment part of the readers and supp@@ orter of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution to the Stro@@ ph@@ e in Sil@@ ent@@ ist ( which will also be published on his blog ) :

in terms of reports and foreign media about the inf@@ ecti@@ ous &quot; strug@@ gle against drugs &quot; in Mexico . these mir@@ rors are not only in statistics . these mir@@ rors not the extinc@@ tion of the human trag@@ edy that make this strug@@ gle with itself .
the reporting from dro@@ gen@@ bos@@ ses as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chef of the Sin@@ alo@@ a card , dr@@ ug@@ ged the stories of the conflict in the background .
a day after a certain inc@@ ident , hardly any man who have learned to live on the con@@ greg@@ ations , who lear@@ nt to live with the pain .
they are behind each glue , behind every bone and in the hundreds of cy@@ tom@@ bs , the stories of count@@ less parents , sons and daughters , friends and partner , whose w@@ ounds may never be he@@ al .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico have created the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drugs live &quot; ) to life and stories of man tells you to the strug@@ gle between the criminal authorities and boxes .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crimes allows us to fear our lives .
the effects are much de@@ part .
for example , if shops close , because they must be thre@@ at@@ ened by drug ad@@ vent@@ h and all comm@@ unes are to buy many kilometres to buy some milk as milk .
the P@@ ain of Sac@@ ri@@ fice
video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear Life changes &quot; ) told this stories .
a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father that seek@@ s each weekend to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ guez , who lost her four si@@ sters , her husband and two of her N@@ eff@@ en .
priest : &quot; how every Sunday we prepare us again on the task , which we have put to go and go to the tom@@ bs , after people who loved us . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he dis@@ appeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should return again , but he came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is still my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
you do not understand the insurance of my father , but it gets un@@ paid out because those who lost a ster@@ ilization .
where should we get the answer ? &quot;
the ed@@ itors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; expl@@ ain why the project is so important :
we must not have to show the faces of those who imag@@ ine the fear . we must show the international community of conflict , the cer@@ em@@ ption and the coup .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists to high @-@ risk areas .
here are some exc@@ erp@@ ts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a Les@@ ve of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution remin@@ ds us that you should never be considered normal than normal , no matter , in which form it occurs :
I know the disease and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism since some years now .
I can pass every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken and see the cover pages with pictures , which are actually only from a textbook on crime or from ac@@ ute from experts .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I feel that I am the only I am the individual or s@@ ad . it works , as a lack of respect to the person who once was once .
I can not be considered normal or considered normal .
it writes further :
No , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old co@@ usin told that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people songs over the &quot; Lab@@ ours &quot; of the Stra@@ ight@@ away &quot; of the streets .
for me , that , when they have lost those who lost someone , and those who have afraid that something also happens .
I see our weak , if stories to blo@@ cked numbers in one statistics .
the facts of man is un@@ believ@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students are just@@ ified in a neigh@@ bo@@ uring that they were allowed . &quot;
I think they are trying to commit out of such trag@@ e@@ dies while they are not stir@@ ring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of press in the main st@@ ad@@ t@@ old@@ ova : like a family with drugs , until they did not destroy the business , as they did not only demol@@ ished the business , but also their family had been demol@@ ished .
you think about everything you lost , and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain was never missed that the grapes remains high when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers were also changed .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
depending on each other , the better is better .
they shut its report with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , for man know not when they will lead you or to kill .
I &apos;ve asked me in these terri@@ ble days , if w@@ aving my de@@ ep@@ ot@@ ed fe@@ el@@ ings would be afraid , but the answer is no , for I have we@@ pt . I have to live with the pain .
the journ@@ alist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution of &quot; The For@@ g@@ otten Children from Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the authority called generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he has asked questions about how : who sing the child of a missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by the organ@@ ised crimes ?
how is it , in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city , Mexican ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents is care of care .
Bry@@ an is a orph@@ ans and it tells you to bring a egg no@@ ck , potatoes round and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vi@@ als with water , sugar and milk powder .
it tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are very important compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for the whole life of violence and the whole life had to live to live .
when he was five years old , told him that his mother dis@@ appeared .
but this was not the day that ended his child@@ hood .
his child@@ hood was past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody Lei@@ che had been shot by armed men from an advanced car .
when Bry@@ an was born , the situation was in Ju@@ á@@ rez as follows :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 when violence against organized crime and strug@@ gle with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most end@@ ang@@ ered city of the world due to the number of murder of citizens of public security and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Prosec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8,5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of the thousands of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico , and die in the soul of the country .
just a few stories are still looking for more than new head@@ lines . this project remin@@ ds us to those who don &apos;t forget to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ cod@@ ata in 2015 , its aim of more information behind the strug@@ gle against drugs , who has resi@@ ded the country into the past four decades , in order to understand this manner .
if a picture worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Nikl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , which he interpre@@ t , contain pictures , on which force is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment , in which it comes to raise a f@@ ake or a f@@ ake to ent@@ lar@@ v@@ ae .
but how is the years after that the first time is get@@ ed ? content in social media , whether it is true or not enough to do it .
we take this photo of a terri@@ ble accident on seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication it was used to fix the trag@@ e@@ dies in Nigeria or Myanmar was held in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong copy of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - le@@ ug@@ es not the fact that there are plenty of car@@ eful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but we have questions about questions regarding pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a Tank@@ wagen place the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te um and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa , the second largest country has been neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble and thereby den@@ ied . the streets in the region were become too dangerous . the streets in the region became too dangerous .
a trag@@ edy fell vic@@ tim to the victims .
the present @-@ representatives described a fire , the du@@ sting of houses , including a cin@@ em@@ as , that was full of people who like to be the soccer world championship .
houses bur@@ nt and wi@@ red bodies in the streets are sc@@ atter@@ ed .
many people were bur@@ ned to unc@@ tu@@ ality .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the preview of this day .
above is an example .
it shows a rows of basic body which are spread on the ground during the floor .
but here the story does not find her end .
over the years , the same picture has been estimated several times on social media , b@@ logs and other platforms , but not to be attri@@ buted to the related trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what is not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fig@@ h@@ ters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am the dec@@ lining of Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ el@@ ism reported a dra@@ st@@ ically of gra@@ dient from which they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops have been bur@@ nt and wal@@ ked in roads and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ ed .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; No one continued to count them , &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch .
many were quoted , shot or bur@@ ned .
only based on satellite images could be displayed in the following time .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ resol@@ ved , but the ar@@ me@@ ant point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the att@@ empt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the picture from the DR Kongo on , when it was a result of evidence of the fact and the possible outside of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre took place in 2,000 in two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this miss@@ al use of the image from the DR Kongo only has been one in a number of errors ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image has been brought as a cover for mass@@ ages .
one step further aim@@ s to provide personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Kongo with sources of the mass media in connection to supply arg@@ uments .
the picture from S@@ ange also joined forces with the dead@@ ly persec@@ ution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to the United Nations , published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape r@@ ape , r@@ ape and some dead , some through com@@ bust@@ ion .
while others were reported against the power against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following , descri@@ ptions these descri@@ ptions with photos from the DR Congo brought :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arab@@ ian news page that had failed . Mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians had been involved in the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Mus@@ li@@ ms . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Kongo to construc@@ t this information .

the global range of false data
traces of wrong coupling can be back to the years 2011 and 2012 , and come from all over the world .
imag@@ ine how far more information b@@ orders can be exceeded , as far as far more information b@@ orders .
a re@@ vers@@ ed image detail with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has been found under 18,8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which were very similar to the original image from the DR Congo .
they are from a mixed mask private pages , platform social media and social publications , as well as national publications and are in many different languages as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have false reports for@@ warded , and have another tried , the f@@ ake to des@@ lar@@ v@@ ae .
we have examples examples of ab@@ used and related to the respective countries in conjunction with the respective countries which they were published on which page were published . so we want to set the operating range than through the language alone .

the article was updated in 2014 and is currently not included in this publication .

this article from 2014 about students who had been resol@@ ved by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the now sol@@ ved , the Catholic near the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly declared that the picture was not of the k@@ illing , but it claims that it was a similar j@@ ih@@ ad@@ ist attack .

they wanted to reach this comm@@ unities that their events that took place in the name of the Isl@@ ams , a bigger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture has been removed as a cover for the Mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times sec@@ ure@@ ly ) . but the messages which were connected to a religious context .
instead , the aim was to investig@@ ate attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media group in comparison of Nigeria and the Attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was alle@@ ge@@ dly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; over the nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , in circulation , discussion strateg@@ ies like this here on Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese and declared it to Fal@@ un .
from the em@@ bass@@ y , in the image of the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the Bil@@ des from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other countries , the aggregate and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , are no more cra@@ zy : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethi@@ opia , Sri Lanka , A@@ zer@@ b@@ ai@@ d@@ sch@@ an , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ wler and only have a picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Mus@@ li@@ ms . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010 , but the image may not be an correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( binding posts ) that move these post@@ s . the first frame foc@@ using on religion .
the picture has been used in relation to major discussion about the silence of Christians through Mus@@ li@@ ms , or to the defence of Mus@@ li@@ ms - the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a afri@@ can live in comparison to a European or French life .
religion underst@@ ands and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth it to investig@@ ate how images in connection with these efforts are used .
however , a lo@@ wering question is , however , what happens if reading these pictures are no longer faith .
with social media , there are Z@@ ig people who have und@@ isp@@ uted the un@@ int@@ ment of the water around a trag@@ edy .
sug@@ ar@@ zes this m@@ ood of error - and Fal@@ se information that the actual gra@@ dient is un@@ true and tast@@ es it the real gr@@ ape of what really in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of viol@@ ent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an arg@@ ument is to det@@ ect the las@@ hing of paintings , which is necessary to det@@ ect the trag@@ edy . bis@@ cuits are even required by the victims .
at the same time , the Sor@@ ge that emerg@@ ing pictures readers and spectators des@@ p@@ ise the ability to receive Emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , investig@@ ated such as usual media , help others to help others ) .
while there are still relevant represent@@ ations in the news media , is fact that they are distinc@@ tive for today &apos;s news @-@ reporting period .
technology experim@@ enting with alg@@ orith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they are thinking about this , in which a picture is something sug@@ ge@@ sts , but actually , but also dissol@@ ved from the context or to totally un@@ used style .
however , a dou@@ b@@ ate of false supplements should also be ad@@ vised as internation@@ ally .

a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ v@@ ow ) , voice tal@@ ented a selection of words from all over the world , are difficult to transl@@ ate it .
such words are available in every language : you press certain situ@@ ations or fe@@ el@@ ings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words have already been well known ( as the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deep into a special culture . ( for example the Spanish so@@ unding esa ) are already known .
but all res@@ ist h@@ art@@ st every test of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough to understand why a full explanation and sometimes the text is required to understand what with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in a online list .
most of these lists of Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and L@@ ingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as :
&quot; vak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Mus@@ u@@ h to make your parents in recognition of them as yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil like :

like Sri Lanka with the wor@@ st dis@@ aster of the decade
the Sri Lanka has seen the wor@@ se high water and re@@ dr@@ ill@@ ary dis@@ aster in this decade compared to this decade .
trig@@ ger@@ ed by Mon@@ sun , usually in late May , are caused by strong rain@@ forests , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 distri@@ cts in the south and west of the country .
following a position of dis@@ ast@@ ers of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed , and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the rivers and mu@@ d .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were killed by 304 secure stay .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water was slowly returned in some areas .
health and hygiene requirements of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos are an impression of the outside dis@@ aster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water walls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter User like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the ext@@ ent of cat@@ astrophe .

the Air Force has delivered five aircraft for rescue activities and another five will be made ready for transport of emergency deliveries to their superior villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have been prepared to help others .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od VI@@ C@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about the hydro@@ carb@@ onic and humanit@@ arian aid .
if any search and rescue drugs for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all , the dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims are -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 4@@ 49@@ 729 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ ation app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) b@@ itt@@ et occupied people to share their service data with the help of the App , that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ical center will be informed .
last year after the dis@@ aster of the Tro@@ pen@@ se Ro@@ an@@ u , introduced Pic@@ Me a &quot; High Water A@@ id &quot; button , a car to over@@ hau@@ l the pick @-@ up of Hil@@ fel@@ de and don@@ ations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ical Red Cross .
simil@@ arly , it was also a &quot; SOS &quot; button a that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat deliver@@ ing activities for flo@@ ods and ind@@ isp@@ ens@@ uring people to the result .
the agreed law@@ ations of the government and civil population Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where multiple social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , they com@@ prise people in trouble in security .
this has prev@@ ents the loss of more lives , with the population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as well as the long path until restoration of norm@@ ality .
Mus@@ li@@ ms that you can see not

use of auth@@ orized .D@@ am@@ als in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bo@@ uring and love friend .
I trust my four years old daughter to keep her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the one minute we call the par@@ olen for the rights of women .
in the next season we concl@@ ude Rights for Trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ ll@@ as and people , some keep the ik@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a American flag , other sk@@ enc@@ ode sol@@ es against Islamic enemy .
my gir@@ l@@ friend I tell me , saying , &quot; These things do not support you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; why because I am not Mus@@ li@@ ma ? &quot; I ask myself . &quot;
I have already led this entertainment .
people with whom I have been working or people who know me to know me - the Sah@@ ar that has been known - from the wides@@ pre@@ ad concept of &quot; Mus@@ li@@ ms &quot; which has been built in their performance .
they sur@@ r@@ ise me .
there are 1.7 billion Mus@@ li@@ ms worldwide .
we do not see all equal .
we pract@@ ising our religion differ@@ ently .
we identify to be a Muslim but to be different . but some@@ how we will be plug@@ ged in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective presentation of art , as soon as Mus@@ li@@ ms how to fit it in there .
ex@@ emp@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the po@@ et whose po@@ etry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to one in the sense , if you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an orth@@ od@@ ox Muslim and gel .
the Islam , the Kor@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died to the center of his po@@ etry .
but in the Western show the religion Rum@@ is deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his po@@ etry .
this del@@ etion makes a great part of the history of 1,7 billion Mus@@ li@@ ms of this world .
another exists in the re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Mus@@ li@@ ms , the Western books already existed since cent@@ uries .
this refin@@ ing image is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the Norwegian Palest@@ inian sci@@ ent@@ ist Edward S@@ aid introduced in the 19@@ 70s the history behind these pictures .
but these pictures are going to go today .
our polit@@ icians , the news industry and Hollywood perc@@ ep@@ tible them .
I have been working for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , f@@ aul@@ ed Nar@@ r@@ atives dom@@ inate our News@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative sur@@ plus sur@@ plus the reality that led in the last three decades of nine Muslim women to choose their first female presid@@ ential election during the USA 2016 .
this Nar@@ r@@ ativ SCH@@ EI@@ TER@@ T to know that when French , Muslim women to wear and Saudi Arab@@ ian , Muslim women to cover their government to cover their entire body , that these both sides are both sides of the same med@@ ille .
a powerful group prac@@ tic@@ ed his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this severe Nar@@ r@@ ativ we@@ ed mus@@ cles women to change movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim pra@@ yers were spoken in the American ground of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been brought to slave de@@ aling with slave .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Mus@@ li@@ ms .
this Nar@@ r@@ ativ has been deep de@@ e@@ ability and comm@@ erci@@ ally occupied by S@@ ik@@ h men and children to the target an@@ tim@@ ing attacks and sc@@ atter@@ s .
because of this stories , we tell us , and on the way , in which we tell it , Islam@@ op@@ position today not only fear of the Islam , the religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories about stories , which are based on figures .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry is s@@ giving thanks to capture the f@@ ool of 1,7 billion .
and we are located here where seven million Mus@@ li@@ ms are taking the highest degree &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americ@@ ans .
six of ten American Mus@@ li@@ ms belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation , from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my rec@@ ru@@ ited parents came to live in New York to live her American dream .
my mother made her first jew@@ ellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard to the Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ ern from New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ ers , created by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had emerg@@ ed the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ m@@ ented Mus@@ li@@ ms and Americ@@ ans .
but am I now un@@ m@@ unden mus@@ li@@ ma and American ?
sometimes , if I ask for me , I say not a f@@ ats , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket j@@ or@@ am , all Mus@@ li@@ ms for themselves - &quot; from respect to Pe@@ pp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to wear all the pocket gl@@ ad with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim &quot; or almost always be selected for additional safety signs at the airport .
there are hundreds of Muslim popul@@ arity , Muslim acti@@ vi@@ sts and inter@@ religious acti@@ vi@@ sts that are eff@@ ort@@ less , wides@@ pre@@ ad lies about Islam .
these lies are produced at the running volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist equipment , which is produced by a good information , which is already a Muslim but what is a Muslim ; or what is Islam , man@@ ip@@ ulates .
due to the stories , we tell us , and on the way , in which we tell them , Islam@@ ist remains in more than just a stran@@ ger , who r@@ ender a woman .

maybe I would see my friend who can see my rock in the fire in the fire that I could see Mus@@ li@@ ma if they can look through the 15 meters of concrete and air , which can separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ al rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I put them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the protection of the corru@@ ption and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
I get three times every of them .
I do so that they protected from the wicked , the evil which you can see and evil which can not see you .

Mus@@ li@@ ma is to speak to speak that they had spoken to me when I have a bad day .
Mus@@ li@@ ma is to be sent to me as she did to refer to God to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means my single Lord .
for a people , that was founded over cent@@ uries , which was founded by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; col@@ oni@@ ously , which was founded a company with the name mem@@ or@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ des @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep signific@@ ance , God , my single Lord .

Mus@@ li@@ ma to be able to know that in the past two cent@@ uries , Europe@@ ans have created all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;

in 2001 , an American Mus@@ li@@ ma means that the su@@ icide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .

it means that ten years ago the first prayer of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by one free of black sl@@ aves with the name Bil@@ al .

there is a reason that cont@@ radi@@ ators who existed in the dark corner of the internet , now the White House is now run .
they are exp@@ on@@ ented grew , because they have Mus@@ li@@ ms to &quot; other . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ orted to grow by changing the &quot; others . &quot;
a few years earlier in earlier it had not yet been given ; now they prevail large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concern@@ ed about the re@@ alities and history , of whom I was not con@@ sci@@ ous as I was so old , but now my daughter is now , but that made me today at an un@@ isi@@ vely Mus@@ li@@ ma .

initiative for n@@ arr@@ ator will re@@ tain ur@@ b@@ ane language variety
history of History , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to occur here and now , despite a language bar@@ rier to you want to enter in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the t@@ els of Stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported before brief over a different initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ transl@@ ate blog .
however , the focus is not on the written , but on the healthy word . it is a try to preser@@ ve the spray variety of large cities and would be wor@@ thy .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ a@@ kland has been carried out in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 , the risk of which small and not quite small languages are not given to the born children .
the project applies to the ma@@ kers of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality in the rest of the world can be avo@@ ided when we need cities where you are not for@@ g@@ otten - safe rooms , in which inhabitants are not for@@ g@@ otten .
while &quot; listen often it is associated to understand how to understand this events , &quot; the list@@ ening to feel to feel . &quot;
in this format history demonstr@@ ate its history at its own language and transl@@ ate it in English .
even if the participants does not have no professional history of history and their account will result in that the audi@@ ences of the audi@@ ences .
they call La@@ chen and Em@@ ot@@ ions more than be the language no longer a bar@@ rier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history from Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which tells us in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the opportunity to expl@@ ain history of the n@@ arr@@ ator of the n@@ arr@@ ator of the n@@ arr@@ ator .
John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from Has@@ en and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ bab@@ we :

they have heard !
they were att@@ enti@@ ve ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have been held in three cities , and organi@@ zers hope to organize this , which are inspired by the project , can join T@@ LS in contact to organize its own history of history .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ valuation of the state debt
with the aim of public debt of Puerto Rico , who took up to 72 million US dollars , who started various religious and bour@@ ge@@ ois organizations at a mass setting ; the march started to the capital city of San Ju@@ ans and ran up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural session of the school ) and the Ö@@ om@@ en@@ ic church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the adv@@ oc@@ ate of the inaugur@@ ation of the school have also been submitted to a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ ardo is dem@@ anded that polit@@ icians and government authorities , which are responsible for the school responsible for their cor@@ p@@ ity .
we require a financial examination and a tap @-@ off without personal interests to public debt , with a firm , our operating conditions that is involved in the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our p@@ ensi@@ oners are not found with sin@@ c@@ end rati@@ os .
we are able to vote measures .
the island - not integrated into the territory of the USA - suff@@ ers under a serious financial crisis .
therefore , so the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a regional independent Non @-@ Profit Organization with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to the state responsible for the existing state recognition .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide re@@ structuring of the state infrastructure .
from the outside measures , without the participation , and pers@@ u@@ asion of citizens are in danger to be rej@@ ected by the people .
the demonstration carried out the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian Palest@@ inian Web@@ developer Ch@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been released since over a year .
but he is not for@@ g@@ otten .
more than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian Reg@@ ime , his supp@@ or@@ ters and rel@@ atives to remember the campaign for his freedom , and remember the contributions that he was open for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re @-@ pub@@ s : pub@@ lica , which will be held annually on the digital culture , which will be held in Berlin , a event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ l@@ anie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a Scientific assistant in France , and Barbara R@@ ühl@@ ing , Managing Director &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ hing extrac@@ ts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective expl@@ oration research ) .
the book that was published in the last year and is free @-@ free , contains a number of attach@@ ments to emplo@@ y with the free culture on the face of the suppression circuit .
it is a hom@@ age to bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it is :
this book would like to be structured as movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected .
acti@@ vi@@ sts , artist , designer , developer , researchers and authors , involved in the movements for free knowledge , we have been working on page to make about the fog , which gives our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create a little sense of our different experiences .
this book is a trial , bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , provided the delivered and ac@@ claimed Internet volunte@@ ers since March 15 , 2012 in Syria .
his name was shot from the directory of Ad@@ ra @-@ prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have since then no information on its current state or stay .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice who want to look back in his own life and they want to know in his normal life , and so immediately .
as a bass price for its invol@@ vement in a free culture , many of us will start from us , about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , acts and dec@@ isions .
why are we today here ?
what we chose to chose ?
what did we have updated in this process of time extreme survi@@ ve ?
the web developer of Open Source and digital services is in det@@ ained at the Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , bass@@ el from the Ad@@ ra prison , one non @-@ military setup , was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the author and An@@ w@@ eld@@ est No@@ ura Gh@@ az@@ i , reported that the military police was put on the basis of a &quot; stric@@ tly ge@@ heim &quot; given command of his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
Gh@@ az@@ i reported that she was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by people who were cont@@ acted as In@@ sider the Ass@@ ad government and set them by a supp@@ os@@ edly death sentence against their husband .
his stay and condition remains unknown .
a team of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and acti@@ vely involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , the bass played a c@@ rucial role in which access to internet and knowledge for the public to the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a Designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently transmitted by the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the bass , writing on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps was none of basic cultural prototy@@ pes used as the plant which began with a group of archae@@ ologist and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construc@@ t the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archae@@ ological sites of the world , was the way of numerous civ@@ ations and con@@ served Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ome traditi@@ ons and pers@@ onic influ@@ ences .
Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after that he began with this work , the IS did not tell this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage , but the world jo@@ ins the world .
this Stri@@ ped in digital archae@@ ology and preser@@ vation has created a period that will be the public , as well as scientists and artists in the future of un@@ assessment .
the bass could not able to close this project until now .
No@@ ura Gh@@ az@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man , his knowledge with other to share , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dre@@ aming freedom and bass te@@ aches me , she taught them to um@@ ar@@ men .
I am over@@ wh@@ el@@ med when I cry his name .
Bass@@ el brought me in English when he was already det@@ ained in j@@ ail .
I learned to read English well , write and speak to speak .
he always has his knowledge with all that he as@@ ks . he has taught other in@@ scri@@ bes to read in English and speak to speak .

Mos@@ ambi@@ que : sentenced to arrest once again for corru@@ ption , due to corru@@ ption .
Mos@@ o @-@ bik@@ ers re@@ acted with anger on a cor@@ p@@ tive accident in case of half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state appar@@ atus had returned to the corru@@ ption .
it deals with Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who arrested in 2008 and in 2010 along with four other def@@ endants because of understanding of 54 million Met@@ ikal ( about 800 000 Euro ) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and required immediately the company that occurred on April 19 , then also happened .
in accordance with a statement of the prosec@@ utor of the Republic , which there was no o@@ bst@@ acles for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there is no o@@ bst@@ acles for Cam@@ b@@ aza , again the company no discipl@@ inary procedure after his det@@ ained .
however , there are many inhabitants not good .
the centre for public integ@@ r@@ ity ( Centro de integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CIP ) , an local institu@@ tion that con@@ vic@@ ted for public transpar@@ ency , con@@ vic@@ ted in an interview with the Deutsche Welle &apos;s decision to introduce the director .
provides a re@@ treat in the fight against corru@@ ption and interpre@@ ted the abs@@ ence of transpar@@ ency and is even a set@@ back to the efforts of our rectangular system , the CIP .
what we will take to the knowledge that the company is a discipl@@ inary procedure against the res@@ ist process .
however , the company was silent , but most adequ@@ ate legal steps for application of corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio Vaz , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic of social media , ref@@ use this behavi@@ or and considered the case as &quot; re@@ war@@ dly &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza , a compet@@ ent type would be consult@@ ant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and it has served half .
he could paid lectures and mot@@ iv@@ ating rep@@ airs , he could be ber@@ ate and his image .
but because he is ink@@ able to be conf@@ essed in the company which he helped to add damage to the company .
consequ@@ ently , it is ob@@ viously : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
withdraw@@ al !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ers and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of his mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state re@@ warded him because he cannot believe him that I had been re@@ warded to such a way that the state has already loaded so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the Mor@@ al to serve and to serve the state , * he had already used a unique opportunity to serve the state in itself .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state in order to become an un@@ ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ly monetary source and the state even was condem@@ ned to a long prison term and was sentenced to a long term penalty .
hon@@ est , I don &apos;t know why this man was re@@ warded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remember the prime minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief into prison :
it is part of the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ o @-@ bik@@ ers will not only remain for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp , self @-@ cutting and - that was told - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations , when he en@@ erg@@ ic confirmed that &quot; a ambiti@@ ous man was able to be able to sell his own individual interest to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambiti@@ ous man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the t@@ ac@@ c , but he does not change from his Amb@@ itions .
an ambiti@@ ous man is available at the same time .
in Twitter the reactions were also rej@@ ected :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years old and came to free .
and today , he set him the company in which he is un@@ tre@@ m@@ ute to the contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - D@@ α@@ ι V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the r@@ assi@@ st@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and quoted many users to un@@ aud@@ iting a lot of users
the bur@@ mes@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick pe@@ se or bo@@ ilers .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons At@@ tri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ r
according to Facebook users in Myanmar took the well @-@ known social network their post@@ s from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word will still be discussed , it is usually used to prove to people ost@@ ind@@ ary origin or general as ad@@ j@@ ek@@ tiv &quot; Indian &quot; .
Facebook is a part of the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; D@@ im ( in bur@@ mes@@ ical let@@ tering ) as a part of an initiative to enter the wides@@ pre@@ ad problem of the Hass@@ an in Bur@@ ma in the social network .
during the last years , the Asc@@ ent of Radi@@ al national movements has given the word to an extremely reliable connectivity .
in particular , it is a word that is usually used by Ultra nation@@ alists as Hass@@ an vs. Mus@@ li@@ ms , which represent a min@@ ority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the m@@ üh@@ l , Hass@@ an in Myanmar , has asked a mult@@ itude of sen@@ su@@ al content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; is usually able to be used with R@@ attle in connection , but the word that call@@ eth not speak of the pre@@ ference .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they have used , in which they had used the use of the word or dou@@ bt the use of his use .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with different things that have the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ table also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ums ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different things by words by the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends got deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on spiritual kind , whether they knew how he made his back pain .
the Satz ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the quest@@ i@@ onn@@ ort ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - similar to the r@@ assi@@ st@@ ical expression very but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
zin Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce the Hass@@ an Radi@@ cal National Socialists , however , however , that Facebook analy@@ tical His m@@ issions , before it will burn all the postcards that are spread in sus@@ pic@@ ism , bre@@ ast@@ ism .
Facebook is the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ ates the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you are on fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it would like to analy@@ ze the post carefully and control it to check the next post @-@ related words .
for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( sphere ) .
the good thing is that this dre@@ ck@@ est nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ an , a fair@@ ly good lesson you will receive a very good lesson .
now it is at the time to circum@@ c@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action is a powerful signal to send the v@@ ad@@ language of these strategy like the efficiency of this strategy do not long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved to start the zen@@ or@@ ship of percussion often a cat and mouse game , wher@@ eby the user is simply start , a new word or an alternative writing of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to use their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his post@@ s when he wanted to announce his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is :
... when I att@@ empt@@ ed to use the new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to rest@@ ore my Facebook friends , that the word is closed .
Iron@@ mon@@ ally , my post office was removed from Facebook and me , post@@ ing and parts of in@@ qui@@ ries for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Post@@ s from hum@@ ans that have no negative deri@@ v@@ atives or the simply att@@ empt@@ ed to show their differences against the Hass@@ an Radi@@ cal National Socialists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post office was removed nothing to do with Hass@@ an :
post without Hass@@ an on Facebook .
in the post part of the author his opinion , why extreme nation@@ alism and religious f@@ emin@@ ism are bad@@ ly bad@@ ly bad@@ ly .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine beli@@ eves that Facebook before the beginning of the initiative would have to ask more , for example the bur@@ mes@@ ical Internet Community on the Council :
Facebook is a well @-@ sw@@ ollen , rac@@ ism in Bur@@ ma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words have to in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally safe more hat@@ red within the various comm@@ unities .
in addition , it appears to have this without local context or technical support and so words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Er@@ bs@@ enc@@ ur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they have found it , they have made mist@@ akes , they don &apos;t seek to re@@ mem@@ or@@ ly dissol@@ ved .
if they only have any respect for the 15 million benefit , which would be a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic Zen@@ or@@ ship has g@@ otten much sp@@ ott under the user .
instead of serious , users can make users more about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see if their post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook post , which were no Hass@@ an , but still have been removed :
used with approval .
the bur@@ mes@@ ical text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see a Indian movie .
only to try if Facebook is removed the Post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , with approval .
the post office is &quot; If you are a doctor , he@@ al you then ? &quot;
screenshot , with approval .
in the last five years of extreme rep@@ ali@@ stic ide@@ ologies and religious F@@ undam@@ ent@@ alists , social networks have been used to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ an in social network drives the violence in the municip@@ alities in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where exc@@ erp@@ ts of Mus@@ li@@ ms and Budd@@ hi@@ sts thousands were forced to escape .
Facebook has been responsible for his fail@@ ure , the bal@@ ancing of Hass@@ ei@@ k works on his bur@@ mes@@ ic pages of control .
but rather simple the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; would adv@@ ise it better to concentrate on the context of concentr@@ ating initi@@ atives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 038 ; Tobago is sl@@ otted with the child

the child is il@@ legal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on June 9 , 2017 , the Parliament adopted a law on 9 June 2017 , that we offer this practice so that the married Age now is 18 .
before this change , some members of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es held some members in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( I@@ ro ) , a group to gather the representative of the various religious groups of the country , since that the state did not get the matur@@ ity of certain religious groups . &quot;
this was un@@ aware of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN children &apos;s legal framework , which is less than 18 years of age .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent .
in 2011 , the statist@@ ical central office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online @-@ pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were best@@ owed , laws on child@@ hood , followed by the feet , and rejo@@ ices in large support .
nevertheless we didn &apos;t work all smo@@ oth@@ ly .
a Hind@@ u guide , for example , had no concern@@ s to say the crit@@ ics of the child before , they should den@@ se because of its own aff@@ airs . &quot;
this type of Rel@@ igious op@@ position for voltages in this actually , dou@@ bt if the op@@ position to vote in the law .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the reb@@ els was decided against the child@@ hood - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including one woman ) of the op@@ position and an independent that could be discussed at Re@@ present@@ atives , where he would be a simple majority in the law .
now only the President of the country and the law shall rise to the law .
a state update of the country gave a status update , which read the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of Law against Child was decided in the Re@@ present@@ ative House with 35 votes and none only .
after having decided in the Senate , the design can now be carried out to the law .
the majority of social media user was exc@@ ited because the laws have been finally last changed .
Facebook Member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a Prime Minister at the Education Ministry of Education , said :
it has been too much time and un@@ necessary sm@@ ith , the kernel of the matter is veil@@ ed , but what you know what ? the child is in Trinidad and Tobago now il@@ legal , and that &apos;s worth almost every prize .
during Ab@@ el Jackson the Opinion about it was definitely long enough to cover the practice of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas , that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for sure - 0 worth it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ade mut@@ ota , who he@@ ars the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a zi@@ v@@ il@@ ges@@ hip Group that is quite open to the law , saying , &quot;
the married Age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of 18 years independently of the religion .
the design for the change of Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was announced today , on June 9 , 2017 .
at the Re@@ present@@ atives , there are 41 members and were present at the vote at the vote .
all the members of the de@@ pu@@ ties were voted to the law for the law .
the child is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long strug@@ gle ( ... ) # half mar@@ ri@@ in use .
many thanks to all acti@@ vi@@ sts who had cau@@ ght him .
congratulations .
a Dan@@ ke at our members of de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma M@@ aha Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj has claimed his int@@ ention to business , the law shall be approved , and he appears to resol@@ ve his promise .
during the Att@@ or@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , thought that Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj Mah@@ ar@@ aj would you wish the deb@@ ate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell Sa@@ w :
Dear Sat , when we take place to talk about the discussion that we might speak , instead of the problem , that the state in our bedroom , that they might need of great , hard s@@ alt@@ ed men that are ab@@ used by major , hard s@@ alt@@ ed men that are ab@@ used , that they would be ready to perform the discussion ?
or believe that there is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a mand@@ ate of the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - but there are still in places on the world , where the children are legal in different ab@@ dom@@ inal or still the norm is , although it is subject to them .

then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ ar to bring to the international stage at the age of 28 .
and his hom@@ et@@ place right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attention attention to Nep@@ al@@ ck .
he described on Facebook , such as the first class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it better give for a passi@@ onate game phot@@ ograph ! !
I experienced me at home when I suddenly appeared to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river stone is only a few minutes from the tourist location Sau@@ r@@ aha .
immediately I ran@@ ged with my camera and was there within a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me up the place on the other side , where the Leopard took place and I immediately began to re@@ tri@@ cky pictures !
Sag@@ ar stre@@ amed an cooperation with authorities to obtain a worldwide recognition of Nep@@ al@@ ese people and would like to make the understanding of that wild animals are not so f@@ aint , as they look like .
and he should know it because he stood at face to face from face to face :
a tiger can not be swe@@ ar by the sheep of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also possible because of the dark on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush , he has appeared immediately , we will see ourselves , and he rest@@ ore me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wil@@ lows animals , placed Sag@@ ar the Logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the Promotion of Nep@@ lig@@ as and Wild@@ ing is not always simple .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Kal@@ y@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and appeared initially to video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization in India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content @-@ Shar@@ ing @-@ Convention .
in many parts , avoid women with greatest care , names of their hus@@ bands , or even of older men in the family .
instead they use a p@@ onom@@ er or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ echn@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences should be used to use the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condem@@ ned to the Indian state of O@@ dis@@ ha , and by her family and the village in the village , after they had given a married relationship with names .
the tradition are not wides@@ pre@@ ad under the name , is also wides@@ pre@@ ad under men . however , they are far less satis@@ faction if all , they should not occur in this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them heal@@ th@@ care , as well as Haus@@ er , a unique club and were thus quickly for main det@@ ectors of the city .
it is a place only for they alone , discuss the p@@ urity of the Patri@@ arch@@ ats and discuss them .
as one of 56 clubs , which is part in 13 Indian States , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is used for the degrad@@ ation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ats .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist works for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of pract@@ ition@@ ers , such as child@@ hood , as child@@ hood , and AIDS , and heads this club .
they are reported that this clubs have created a safe place for those women and they have made simultaneous play at the same time at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , hand@@ led by women that are not named her hus@@ bands in the name .
she has decided for this topic , because they wanted to identify the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
the name of their hus@@ bands not according to ex@@ quis@@ ite , is a Br@@ auch who received all the oblig@@ ation and never put in question in question .
Roh@@ ini requests :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman is resp@@ ects her husband and a long life wishes .
a woman who does not have to keep it as a rep@@ utation , as wife without mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deep sp@@ elt that we have never made us to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini who had also called her husband to his name , at home , how it works .
they showed the video of the discussions on her husband and her we@@ ak@@ age .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my fail@@ ure and my husband made still long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I know him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage started by Roh@@ ini in their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some believed that it would be a good thing because it is me@@ ant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini demonstrated a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
after video projection the women to bring the discussion with a exercise in course .
Roh@@ ini bat every participant in the name of her husband with various host@@ ages - happy , mo@@ us@@ ly , s@@ ad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we do not say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us , meaning that they are not resp@@ ectable ?
should it be not equ@@ ival@@ ents ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married and this was the first day when they had brought the name of their hus@@ bands , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ w from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , who married women the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so sh@@ ould@@ ers that she was just before the whole exercise just before the whole exercise , the whole for@@ war@@ ming against him and his family , caus@@ ing him cur@@ se him .
the expression was static on their pro@@ positions .
I think I will never forget it .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ausch in order to have broken the women that they would try out at home , they would try to call her hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas them to the head in the head : his wife could not hear his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family .
when her son of her we@@ ak@@ ened her , she got afraid , and told that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought that I do it . &quot;
a husband of one participant was less understanding and the situation in force .
Roh@@ ini reports , how women have tried to stop other prac@@ tices , as for example the tr@@ agen of the zin@@ ok red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the husband :
why must only show women that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point when he was also day .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to bear him .
the other women have not complete , but my , they are now able to wear in a better position , even to carry him in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can replace their differences and goals .
&quot; we make a excursion with every discussion club .
normally we packed lunch and water and go out of the field .
I don &apos;t want to make the women make that he could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own Bir@@ th@@ days with cakes ; they t@@ anz@@ ten , and told us things through things that they had never made before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working here for so many years to these problems , and yet I have done about some things , for example , as our identity were kn@@ owing to our hus@@ bands , nor as ever .
it fe@@ els great on , certain things according to say too , no matter how small they come .
in a discussion round , we have taught us through the concept of honour and related to clothing .
some women in the group have been worn as Sar@@ is .
for most , the ok@@ ay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ ts @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a p@@ ants , carry it to wear .
after a lot of dis@@ pu@@ te and discussion about the co@@ atings of your own hang@@ ers , the Mor@@ al connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ y Roh@@ ini ye own couple of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Upper hem@@ isph@@ ere ) in a discussion round , so that women were able to bear them .
next you have decided to plan to start a trip to Go@@ a , where they can bear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since her first discussion had already been changed , Roh@@ ini that things come slowly to the rolls :
we have made only small steps today .
some women tast@@ es a few times , but then heard again to say the name of her husband .
some , me included , but only when they are alone , and no other family members are .
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women have now wear at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their fore@@ head .
the women &apos;s discussions club know that the changes that they want to reach more freedom in their lives - how to make more freedom of movement or your own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ate river .
by caus@@ ing other self @-@ confidence , you will adm@@ ire them that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is an victims of the Patri@@ archy .
I am it .
but this club gives any of us that will change anything .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there is a chain reaction , if any woman is talking at home and other people , what we speak , what we do .
we are located all in the same boat .

Singapore : city or Land ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Domaine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be du@@ g , since Singapore is recognized on international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has a deb@@ ate in the b@@ log@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the occasion of the International Women &apos;s Association of New York , the minister that many people saw the Domin@@ anz of Singapore critical party , because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
he und@@ ergo that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... No one has put in question whether New York is a democ@@ racy ...
that &apos;s it , wher@@ eby most people have a mist@@ ake .
I have tried to expl@@ ain that we may be different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the Blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o decided to sp@@ reading the Minister of Justice , &quot; to def@@ end the existing aut@@ or@@ ical appearance of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and appe@@ ar@@ ances , this valuable land , we hear , that we ulti@@ mat@@ ely no land .
it was so volcan@@ ic , it had the pro@@ long@@ ation of a flight before the Respon@@ si@@ bilities , a mandatory viol@@ ation .
Singapore if you are not my country , whose land is then ?
the idea of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very good : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , because he appeared un@@ ref@@ used und@@ erm@@ ined .
he has def@@ ended his idea that Singapore with towns like Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to equ@@ ally , equ@@ ally and perman@@ ently run by a party .
these cities are democ@@ ratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the Th@@ em@@ as , again the good old gl@@ ers of the aut@@ or@@ it@@ arian mach@@ in@@ ers , who for@@ give the hum@@ ans to leave the tor@@ si@@ onal logic , since it fits better to their power .
during the last week , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests to our press , our law@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ answers .
related questions tar@@ ry he with non @-@ answers r@@ ation@@ aler art .
Rachel Z@@ eng dem@@ anded Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , as they did not understand these conclusion ..
I pers@@ onally , I find a little bit very difficult to kill .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so that country belongs to our city ...
shortly I understand nothing .
I would be very good when our wer@@ y K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to resol@@ ve this point unless it was high to be part of the city of Singapore .
by An@@ on on the blog , he has published his comment on the crit@@ ics that you should begin to understand the whole text of the conference , to understand the context of statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
Read the signing of the manuscript .
when he said that Singapore rather a &quot; city &quot; be as a land , &quot; declared that why the elections in Singapore so un@@ ble@@ eding , even if we are free and happy elections .
he sold Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; be no country , &quot; he did not ob@@ viously un@@ ob@@ viously in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes a leader of a her@@ an generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ian statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to place ...
at least , I knew Lee k@@ uan Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected to understand with them or not , but this is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore , I am dou@@ bt , and I am not even sure if he really believe that he is def@@ ending , what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ asek Review submitted the tail points of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; gut@@ ters a mist@@ ake , or was it an ex@@ ud@@ guard ?
if Singapore is not a country , we have been just as independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go to the so@@ vereign state of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is simil@@ arly land and city .
because he plays an important role in the government &apos;s government , the statements of the Lord Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious importance .
why do they aff@@ ect their military service , but def@@ end them only their city , but not their country ?
who must re@@ loc@@ ate our prime minister of b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel circle ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, then the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ jah@@ ung , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; I don &apos;t say what I said &quot; ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have much more expensive than much more expensive ...
No one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city - / In@@ sel@@ ective .
I can understand that we often have no statement like &quot; the defence of the country in front of everything , etc . but this is not quite true .
we should talk about the defence of the city .

we are cour@@ age@@ ous .
we tell us very often &quot; dis@@ comfort . &quot;
Canada also applies even as the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not so like this types south of the border .
we live Canadian .
I h@@ ate it .
first I &apos;ve enjoyed many American friends , which I was very li@@ able .
I would like to make me nothing when I would change to John@@ ny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be known as &quot; nice &quot; is in fact , as the gut@@ ti@@ fication , gentle , but reas@@ on@@ ably un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own can@@ ic double de@@ strian ) .
if Canada really have a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , the fact would be a step forward . but the real problem exists in fact that &quot; nice &quot; has no person@@ ality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can be sto@@ cked .
har@@ m@@ less , its name is unknown and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this may be something good , if you want to stay in the background , far from the things that happen around a around .
I would even go to say that the wish is to be free and alone , a main stand of the can@@ adi@@ er is .
we wet to care about our own aff@@ airs to care of our own aff@@ airs .
what is outside as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps easy @-@ mill cour@@ tesy .
Kan@@ adi@@ er speak not often over the fence with the neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
we are missing the warm , open friend@@ liness , which I spent with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , then Just@@ in Tru@@ deau opens the stage to show that Canadian has more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made a sex@@ y to em@@ y in Canada .
Music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Thai Jun@@ ta
one of the famous pop @-@ band played a music video in Thailand , which took over the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed by 2014 , despite its promise to recover the civ@@ ilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( Ph@@ ad@@ et Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells , which makes him his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the survi@@ ved military force of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was written by many fans and other Internet use to describe the situation in the country .
the video to song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the Facebook was shared at Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 liqu@@ es .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator was blo@@ cked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist the public after a group of activ@@ ist , this video .
the video can be interpre@@ ted as a creative and entertain@@ ing introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ exceptional with the situation in the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these pictures of the video , which rel@@ ate to some of the political them@@ es which have been pursu@@ ed in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refers to the dra@@ stic condition 44 of the pre@@ f@@ atal Constitution , which received the chief of the he@@ aling absolute decision on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your setting &quot; refers to the transition change &quot; from journalists , students , scientists , acti@@ vi@@ sts , polit@@ icians and other people who can be used by Jun@@ ta as well as crit@@ ics .
the picture above refl@@ ects the implementation of the law on computer resources , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules is often used by authorities , acti@@ vi@@ sts and other crit@@ ics of the state .
for this purpose , a new uni@@ fication was set up for this purpose , the online content survi@@ ved the mon@@ archy , the mon@@ archy will have persec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ age against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ est@@ ration ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was pro@@ claimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of army .
one of the problems that continues to buy the Jun@@ ta , is their decision expensive U @-@ boats , even though safety experts they war@@ med that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a loss of tax .
in the video , even as people will be thro@@ wn in a black delivery van , before you will bring it into a inter@@ action camp , another problem .
some journalists sitting in prison , because they have been al@@ leg@@ ed &quot; conf@@ usion &quot; in the company , and Internet use are thre@@ at@@ ened long , they should have mon@@ archy the mon@@ archy .

the post @-@ war company reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian War , but his sc@@ ars are still clearly visible in this part of the Republic .
the exhaust villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show a marked pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Kh@@ arch@@ il@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ hammer of Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ si@@ ans , Gre@@ eks and Armen@@ ia , Georgia , and Armen@@ i@@ ans and worked in the area together .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live the biggest part Rus@@ si@@ ans and far@@ mer in the area .
such sett@@ l@@ ements are also mentioned in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien .
in the pre @-@ war period still more than 10.000 people still lived here only a few hundred people in these spir@@ ators .
this is known for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
since 2011 , the total population of the distri@@ cts had risen more than 16@@ ,000 people after they had hardly gone over a decade .
in 1989 approximately 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , the ch@@ rus@@ ker@@ at@@ ow@@ kas are called sy@@ mbol@@ ism for the ra@@ ising and ref@@ err@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are spread and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; that everything is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I speak with you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full life .
there were community centers , schools and kind@@ erg@@ art@@ ens , all of the community .
now only pav@@ ed road with hidden practical buildings .
people who lived at this place and had their contribution to the Central Planning of the Soviet Union , in the district .
in the spirit of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages are similar .
the Ch@@ rus@@ cht@@ sch@@ ow@@ kas , which houses still one or two families , recogni@@ ze on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they dis@@ covering me with the camera in the hand , they move immediately .
&quot; our mother has b@@ anned us that we will phot@@ ograph us phot@@ ograph , says one of the girls .
&quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden , that is everything . &quot;
the girl per@@ ish their gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leave it the destroyed building and dis@@ appear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish min@@ ing company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as vi@@ eh@@ zu@@ cht , be@@ vel and vegetable construction .
it &apos;s difficult to come about the laps .
the district management supplies its villages in winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what happened , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago a older woman died with names of Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante Gal@@ ya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Cher@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their eld@@ est daughter , who lives in France did not leave Gal@@ ina to live Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien , to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would like to take care of her daughter from her daughter and keep it , that it supports its young grand@@ chil@@ ds .
Gal@@ inas monthly Ren@@ te are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden still a house , it is very difficult to survi@@ ve , they are too .
T@@ ante Gal@@ ya tells that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are going to visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this : every one is working with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a recent neigh@@ bo@@ urs in the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; , calling T@@ ante Gal@@ ya her . &quot; they said , We could build Zu@@ cchini . &quot;
I have prepared the floor .

Gal@@ y@@ as Con@@ feder@@ ation in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remin@@ ds of the village in front of the war .
despite the mig@@ rants who live in Central Russian , Oss@@ et@@ ien and Georgia ( the land Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ien broke away ) they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 Children &apos;s child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
close to the house where nat@@ u@@ as kind@@ ergarten was once , she kept sw@@ an , c@@ ows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens .
it tells you that there was a very serious situation , when many people after the war ended the village .

&quot; we don &apos;t have afraid of the dark road or a few people .
you can acc@@ ustom@@ ed to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually , it was rather something to do with pl@@ ague .
after the war , there was bar@@ ely work and all survi@@ ved as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation occurs in the end , a little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
one Ball flies out of the window and another young kids after him .
he plays with the ball , which went down the hill .
one group children pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , throw some of them stones in the fall@@ ing buildings .
this ruins are a part of their child@@ hood , which ensure unc@@ ertain@@ ly in their lives .

in Mexico it houses &quot; M@@ ama Africa &quot; Mig@@ ran@@ ten on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Am@@ y Brack@@ en was published on 19 April 2017 on the site of our Partners PRI@@ .org website and published here with friendly permission .
on the way of mig@@ rants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places for their hospitality .
I visited this places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ rug@@ ation pink and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ r@@ ingen in T@@ ed@@ dy@@ b@@ bears form .
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name M@@ ama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it hers@@ elf ) a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans has become a goal of the journey .
the hotel has no charming charm .
for approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with gro@@ unded , slo@@ ping walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - nevertheless there &apos;s hundreds of afri@@ can and Haiti mig@@ rants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ os rez , come to the people in full mini@@ buses and the upper part of the coast to call : &quot; M@@ ama Africa !
where are you M@@ ama Africa ? &quot;
at the time it is more quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez have already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already made outside on cart@@ ons .
they would like to ref@@ use none .
they also helps them to the hospital if they are si@@ ck , they bu@@ ys their medicines that they cannot pay them with one Bal@@ m away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ iao , originally from Angola , was originally arrived at a short time .
I asked him if M@@ ama Africa was a reas@@ onable name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ iao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a J@@ ogh@@ ur@@ tb@@ n ) with conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and ho@@ pes to go to Boston .
photo : Am@@ y Brack@@ en .
&quot; Yes , yes , &quot; answers with a sm@@ ile . &quot; I feel really that it fits , since African women are very nice women .
very lo@@ ving .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very well . &quot;
Sebast@@ iao travels with his sister , the ho@@ pes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
in Brazil , you have lived in Brazil , however , it is a few Afri@@ kaner that are on the way into the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then take the north to the north .
the family had heard from other directions of M@@ ama Africa . &quot; M@@ ama Africa is one well known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he told that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner often have been travelling together , and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking to Wh@@ ats@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his position leader , Mich@@ elet lived in Brazil , and has worked as a construction worker for the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ ama Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ stick@@ et after Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he created in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; M@@ ama Africa is our mother and let them go again , &quot; reply to sm@@ ile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you to send their score often , if they have continued to report it or to report their journey over the course of their journey .
it states that you have Christian faith in their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare the chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps here very known , but it is not the only radio hope for mig@@ rants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
on the other end of the city leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela at the other end of the city .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family mig@@ rants were included in their small house .
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that Bu@@ stick@@ ets had to be sold to many African mig@@ rants .
he began to help them to get a reas@@ onable price , then he has offered his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area without .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declared that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; told . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I have cross@@ es the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there three years , he was rej@@ ected in a Ra@@ zz@@ ia in his place from the United States .
the majority of mig@@ rants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from central America , other residents open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had flown away in Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to have a plan to have a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he as@@ ks after a accommodation and a unknown , an all@@ er@@ ity , has offered its roof .
some months later , the family still lives and att@@ empt@@ ing to deci@@ de where the next steps will go .
Back in the House of M@@ ama Africa is all over guests .
in the track cons@@ ult the rice quiet their phones .
a small bus is arrived today and has 20 new guests , a majority of Som@@ alia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that your house is full , but it is also nost@@ alg@@ ic , because of which they were gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother flas@@ hed them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of their daughter with African hair , who has made a Kund@@ in , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travel@@ ers more , boy and old .
they lau@@ gh trau@@ ma , while they are brief@@ ly brief@@ ly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ erst@@ one , repe@@ at@@ edly left every time . &quot; they are already continued . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang &apos;s residents are forced to install a surveillance App .
one @-@ point Check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter user .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the West China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware to their phones .
on 10 July , the cell phone users received a cell notification in Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city Ur@@ um@@ q@@ i to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the message he is said that the app &quot; would you to get access to ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ ic information . &quot;
but now , the authorities also use the app for more than the com@@ bat of ter@@ ror@@ ism .
according to an exclusive report of radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app , messages with a private se@@ am group .
in the notification of the police , that the app shows the sources and the distribution paths of ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ s and persec@@ ute , together with &quot; il@@ leg@@ alen Rel@@ igious &quot; activities and educational information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective services for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age p@@ orn@@ ographic websites , by online fr@@ aud , i@@ ans and Ph@@ ono pages to make users to adv@@ ise how much time they need online to control the home network .
this app help with filters for inf@@ ants to develop the children to develop a healthy li@@ festyle .
an app with these features can be used in diverse ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers , the home network of a person to man@@ ip@@ ulate or out of ste@@ al .
this introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages via digital zen@@ or@@ ship in China mostly foc@@ using on users in the east and south , is the reality very often d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er for those who live in away , thre@@ at@@ ened ethnic min@@ ority interests as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit the ur@@ is@@ diction and satis@@ faction in conflict areas , the authorities often re@@ loc@@ ate extreme clim@@ ates and surveillance measures .
that was published on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; ) , the quoted messages in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point , where they were en@@ rich@@ ly checked , when they installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that the people can install the App within 10 days .
if you have found a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be im@@ pris@@ oned until 10 days .
this is a re@@ treat for techn@@ ological development .
they have forced the people who are intended for older people who are intended to use for older people .
this is a shape of cap@@ tivity by in@@ ev@@ itable technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( r . ) MUS@@ T China &quot; ( - ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from the emerg@@ ing that the software can take the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus ob@@ tain@@ able to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones are available in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly need a reaction to the instructions of the city of party , to minim@@ ize the spread of il@@ leg@@ alen .
all government offici@@ als , authorities and associated with the party , including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ed to follow the instructions of Cy@@ bers@@ ec@@ urity Office when operation of its computers and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , an US @-@ American Human Rights organization , mentioned this new surveillance method :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ q@@ i , to all residents and entre@@ pren@@ eur , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards .
the int@@ ention is ob@@ viously any of &quot; ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ ic videos &quot; to identify and destroy these action . this promotion seems , however , however , they are oblig@@ atory for a whole range of other possible appoint@@ ments , including such a religious religious or political funds .

they have arrested me and my father three times , but that I didn &apos;t let me &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security services , that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power over us , by taking the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts which we knew .
five young people were smo@@ ked during a peaceful prot@@ ests like we@@ ed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it looked like that the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er shredded
all the city quarter cov@@ eted to do , just my own .
for the first time it was still , exc@@ it@@ ly , the wrong time , even if I had no high demands to a city , until the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organis@@ ms and their comp@@ ass .
in the third night , the things had a little bit after the power supply in the quarter had heard .
I broke the silence by using several times &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to place .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends decided to me ; we worked on a magnificent image that all my expectations have been full and fulfilled .
in such a moment you will be aware that you are free from the lamp , but it is not interested in the righteous .
I received an call from my father : &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learn the following : No matter how much honey you can look back - nothing can give thee your voice over all the way up to the office of the security services .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; let me hear me , as you &apos;@@ All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &apos; is , or you are then to cry enough if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ ful@@ ness eyes opened on me .
&quot; and you will see you what to look in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with cour@@ age .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my Tor@@ ence , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so safe when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have had to for@@ g@@ otten my voice since yesterday .
and I believe I have never heard you in the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment who could have such that f@@ atal consequences for me , and yet do I have no word of what I have said .
&quot; put him in detail and his father equ@@ als together with this . &quot;
&quot; his father equ@@ als with this . &quot;
the rock of this destruction is in the nose until today is in the nose .
he was said to a &quot; Syn@@ drome , &quot; a se@@ atic tort@@ ure that was susp@@ ended on monthly .
I sh@@ aw@@ ed the court .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then through the courtyard and the second office , which leads through one speed to the single cells .
I am looking forward to me all the details before I entered the room .
differ@@ ently , otherwise they have been assigned to me this time a larger cell .
I have to share them with only one more pris@@ oner and must not use me without permission , without permission .
after some minutes that fe@@ el@@ ings like a whole life , the servants left the cell , and I handle on a alt@@ ed communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I drove that my cell is a &quot; first @-@ fishing . &quot;
after long c@@ rying out , he was finally ulti@@ mat@@ ely last .
in no one of the surrounding cells in none of the surrounding cells a resp@@ ected man middle age , which is similar to me and called &quot; doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , let not recogni@@ ze me no mark@@ ings of fac@@ tories , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone who like to do my voice ? &quot;
all answers Ask a existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
maybe he will listen to immediately .
the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would be fre@@ ed him when I ab@@ ide .
li@@ ar .
I would like to escape a bird sw@@ ap to distri@@ bute all these c@@ rows in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the af@@ ar , I listen them to &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around these times the ter@@ ror , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinc@@ ed that black the color of the destruction is until I presented the yellow light that I presented the tom@@ cat in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; en@@ play on 13 . of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to listen to . &quot;
in order to protect the state security before us , and prevent the ter@@ ror and the ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ s in us , speak they in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - therefore , they played their religion in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect , and made the narrow eye @-@ field of their world .
this is not a house that there is no land ; there is a cur@@ se to turn it co@@ existence in order to trans@@ form the crime of their cl@@ ans in a her@@ oes .
I entered the hearing and tre@@ m@@ bling at Abu I@@ mad , a slim and tri@@ bes man ; at least he comes to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; Con@@ vers@@ ation , despite the fac@@ ial ex@@ pres@@ sions that follow him , &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can join so much more important with your life as you have to prot@@ est and demonstr@@ ations that it will be found out at the end . &quot;
I answered not .
I have to acc@@ ustom@@ ed it to answer me .
I can really say much more , when ventilation and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me to a usual communication .
when and how happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to acc@@ id@@ ents me or ow@@ el to acc@@ id@@ ly , even though I had done nothing to earn these penalty .
on penalty in all of their diversity .
his command is it to rip as much meat as possible from the body .
he called the lov@@ ingly &quot; cre@@ ator . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which comes probably from the clo@@ aks .
your H@@ enk@@ er get rid of your writing .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can not hold your ter@@ ror .
my Schre@@ ie fell not enough , why they do not change the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest I asked me , whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage bin or whether it belonged to the normal working amen@@ ities .
they had to fle@@ w four cable to each other to present themselves from their sight , great in@@ vention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them , while I was still in the line .
I lost my body in my body - and my voice , why I heard it .
the h@@ enk@@ er notice the cooling and did not take part in all that he was a neigh@@ bour@@ hood to a electrically charged bar .
electricity through my whole body , enough to feed my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ n@@ aked body that stret@@ ched out on the ground , the perfect power conductor .
the do@@ ck@@ ness dis@@ appeared and the pain was again there .
after two terri@@ ble hours he decided that he met his oblig@@ ation for this night .
that must have been around mid@@ night .
I decided to lay me again ; let &apos;s say that I was my only option .
some hours passed away that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning .
the door opens and the morning ful@@ f@@ ils the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ um@@ icker . &quot;
I pay with the voice of a ex@@ hau@@ sted young people : &quot; my lord , my Father has to make ven@@ e@@ ered care . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and be@@ weg you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Japanese Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib speaks on the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free differences and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the picture was taken by Am@@ an Ma@@ dan , the original author of this text , recorded .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings together the majority of his time . sometimes , he sw@@ ert to his screen at his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can rely on , is a cigar@@ ettes between his fing@@ ers or her with Nik@@ ot@@ in be@@ aten lips .
he lives in the ro@@ ast of his family house , who had heard these members of the West@@ bank in 1967 ; the year that Israel had completed his occupation of the West@@ bank in Palestine , who had lived from her village in Palestine in whom they had lived as rock@@ y ( about : far@@ mer ) .
for the age of six years H@@ da@@ ib is a passi@@ onate assets , who sur@@ vey@@ ed the conserv@@ ative majority and its viol@@ ent opinions about BUSINESS LA@@ CH@@ TER@@ I@@ LL@@ EN , sexu@@ ality and free differences between art and Rap@@ id .
with his music , being often tested with topics like Oriental po@@ is@@ ism , but also dem@@ anded the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics will find out only in his hom@@ et@@ own Amman R@@ relev@@ ance , but also in cities where Damascus is rich in Y@@ emen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as a man that is restricted by bo@@ und@@ aries , and it can feel that according to the dis@@ ast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ venti@@ ons in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if it is not open , he h@@ ated against the US American Foreign Policy , a particular separation .
H@@ da@@ ib viewed its art in Amman .
recorded by author .
H@@ da@@ ib did not believe that his co @-@ feel for those who are trying to do something with his identity as &quot; Palest@@ inian po@@ is@@ ers of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and yet never had never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circum@@ st@@ ances so , &quot; bet@@ ont H@@ da@@ ib .
then he added : &quot; I think so because I got a man , while he dissol@@ ved in water dissol@@ ved N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the Holy month Ram@@ a@@ dan ; in this time it is intended for Mus@@ li@@ ms , from sunrise until sun@@ set .
the current law would also refer to the public consumption of food during Ram@@ a@@ dan il@@ legal .
ob@@ viously , H@@ da@@ ib did open a certain we@@ ak@@ ness , with an old traditi@@ ons . on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a s@@ eng@@ end hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little with prot@@ est against Islam .
bas@@ ically the sacri@@ fic@@ ed coffee and the sw@@ ades of the K@@ ent cigarette lighter in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan like a prison under the sky , especially when you have a look into the neigh@@ bo@@ uring countries .
so you can avoid simple things to do basic things - as to drink to the public during Ram@@ a@@ dan water - to be not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Jord@@ anian has said a presence of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some par@@ liamentary elections that support the Islamic action in the Muslim branch of the Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - arg@@ um@@ able that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spok@@ es@@ woman in the Islamic co@@ alition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that had been cancelled because of sexual orientation in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
many fixes , the commitment of the band in the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that represents the old leg@@ it@@ im@@ acy of author@@ it@@ im@@ acy in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the young people as &quot; progressive jack@@ ets of human rights , &quot; which continue to continue &quot; for a int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual and cultural plans . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sei@@ z@@ able Rh@@ et@@ or@@ ites , but actually a significant cryst@@ all@@ isation reality in Jordan refl@@ ects in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ ib traditional Gender E@@ tern@@ s to b@@ elly by giving his vision from the fate of Arabic women , vo@@ id sex have sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of an open @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs can be cut up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red Lake ; perhaps the blood of count@@ less women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they can trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mor@@ de &apos; has come down - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary mor@@ de in 2016 reached its high point ; however , however , the institu@@ tional infrastructure is missing to support women to support sacri@@ fic@@ ed murder or domestic violence .
according to a law to re@@ bre@@ ast@@ ating power against the year 1954 , women that is a danger of in@@ adequ@@ ate violence , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ gl@@ itter@@ ro@@ k@@ rat@@ ic exp@@ ense as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music is very popular in great popul@@ arity and is known , even before them@@ es , in his country for long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ da@@ ib rides that his work is polit@@ ically , sp@@ ati@@ al his music that is full exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly appro@@ aches to sexu@@ ality , freedom and Op@@ inions expressed , not of polit@@ ics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
she was told me , &quot; says he .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; takes the question according to the Palest@@ inian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , which will be focus on poverty .
the list of songs which are polit@@ ically modified in the core .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
this song is repeated in this song :
&quot; you are free , and any other is also . &quot;
in another course of the songs H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind market , which can get in his words , &quot; it is faith or not believe , het@@ er@@ o- or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
it is notic@@ ed that almost any one in Jordan over the rights of flo@@ ods and readers , and that comments on the equ@@ ation of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals will be heav@@ ily ind@@ ens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular online range Ro@@ ya to prove that his comments from the context , twi@@ sted , and his opinion has been b@@ aked .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only one worked version , &quot; says he .
today H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is not against the hom@@ osexu@@ als of the Islam .
he mentioned in Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which is still alive thanks to its hom@@ o@@ er@@ ot@@ ian po@@ ems .
H@@ da@@ ib is as@@ ks : if Abu Nu@@ what could work in the eighth century , in the eighth century it could be open to hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ anian does not work ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the toug@@ h kingdom , it is nothing more that the government attacks on the free expression per@@ forms and that progressive .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jewish intelligen@@ ce service took several former government offici@@ als and members of the teaching region , with the grounds to be expressed in social media , who merg@@ ed with the deep in the country ad@@ vent@@ ed corru@@ ption .
in addition , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the l@@ ace of the Eis@@ ber@@ gs - the real challenge is to work on a structural change in the next generation of Jordan &apos;s next generation .
for him , progress is a permanent rep@@ utation and take advantage of Jord@@ anien , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now looks like the second time in a row , but the way of progress , be@@ aten and internal changes . it is safe that the changes from day to day in the heart of the Jewish society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib , such as million other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without inter@@ venti@@ ons from abroad .
he did not dre@@ amed of it , his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience . &quot;
perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature a real and basic re@@ vel@@ ations - and not by bom@@ bs , stre@@ amed and artificial type of democ@@ rac@@ ies . at least ho@@ pes for .
it is far as far as far as H@@ da@@ ib , it is also possible to push back resistance .

at the same time Peru - how many other medium and Southern American countries - an increasing demand for men .

the following article is the revised version of the report &quot; Lieb@@ es@@ bot@@ her@@ ds@@ men , who published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write it to people who know ?
is it not much more import@@ antly , people who feel out of you to asc@@ ension ?
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian acti@@ vi@@ sts Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ rag@@ a by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation no longer from the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ onc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation ) to write young people to write Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ em@@ ern letters .
only before brief was the country place of a historical event and they wanted to help their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had been closed a peace treat@@ y with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ e@@ weg@@ ation F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Columbus ) , who forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International has received the signing of peace agreement as important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos for his awar@@ ding the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , one long path before the column is still a long path until you can talk about an effective re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation and peace of peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ emia , who have lived for many years in il@@ leg@@ alen bearings , and around the watch their weapons , have to integ@@ rate their weapons again in life as a civ@@ ilians .
the kol@@ um@@ bi@@ an Society again that acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in compet@@ ent an@@ xi@@ ety and in some cases de@@ ep@@ ened to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ emia . it has to ass@@ ist these rows in their rows and support the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinc@@ ed that the young live column will help and help the integration process .
and so that they did also : up to now , thousands of young people were written - Lieb@@ es@@ bot@@ atives to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ emia in order to welcome them again in the company .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 Let@@ ters - one for every former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion fig@@ h@@ ters who will be handed over to pers@@ onally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as In@@ spiration for the campaign
the idea for re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation was created on the World summit in Bog@@ ot@@ á , in February 2017 , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian who had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love those who love to love the Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands , but those who need much more necessary .
he re@@ tain , he told his love with people who had need to know the most urg@@ ent con@@ sol@@ ation .
so the plan to write the letters of hope and support for former fig@@ h@@ ters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in the company and to make a new life that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a special story of peace to a joint history of peace . &quot;
to date , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all larger cities of Columbus as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I would have thought that someone would be awarded to me . &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the United States area in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ tion region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art had to bring the letters to pers@@ onally .
the members of the F@@ ARC proved to be done as they had previously done before the commands of their guides .
but this time they received No commands , but letters full of man from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all shareh@@ ol@@ ding . &quot; it is incre@@ di@@ bly , how many different fe@@ el@@ ings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that was between , and told the polit@@ ics student Manuela J@@ im@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ or of the Valle del Cau@@ ca province , this unforgettable experience is as follows :
after that we had passed the letters led me a former fig@@ h@@ ters through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa fig@@ h@@ ters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ast@@ ers live ) I saw a Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ast@@ er , who wrote something .
I had an@@ xi@@ ety down , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gren@@ ade La@@ un@@ cher , a dead@@ ly we@@ apon in the d@@ orn@@ bra@@ id .
I said to him , &quot; Hello , what do they just doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I am ans@@ wering a letter to me .
it is a very nice and great letter .
never in my life , someone has written a little as a nice , and answer me . &quot; since I ran the te@@ ars over the che@@ eks .
I made him very strong , and set me in addition to the Gren@@ ade La@@ un@@ cher .
perhaps he was the war in the war , it was passi@@ d , all the years of the loy@@ al haz@@ ard this fig@@ h@@ ters , and wanted to write this letter to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never been to re@@ tain more about his life as a war . &quot; I would have thought that someone would have thought that someone would have been for@@ given me for my error .
but now I know that there is outside a society that wa@@ ited with open arms to us .
until now I have learned , how I have to go with weapons .
but now you can learn peace , I can learn many things and in dig@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
new voices
for the opening , students and some guide of the F@@ ARC started a discussion round .
the students had grown to grow up as early as the war and the F@@ ARC already existed in the Al@@ or@@ gen@@ ius .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC f@@ ought the history of the organization to develop their ide@@ als and expenditure on the whole of Colom@@ bian people . &quot; many years long have experienced , how we have the opportunity to develop our political party , we can contri@@ bute to us to a political party , the company in this country is just@@ ified .
for a goal of this size , it is worth to over@@ come all the o@@ bst@@ acles , &quot; told them of them .
Manuela was im@@ pressed :
these people hear that so far never had been found , and so that people had seen that people who have seen people as mon@@ sters , and even h@@ ate , even people with beautiful ge@@ sts who were fil@@ med by their life circum@@ st@@ ances and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality , lives in which the country lives to me .
but it includes me that all men - even those who were killed and so much damage can have to bring us something , and a sm@@ ile and a dressing .
many former fig@@ h@@ ters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the columns of the columns was made that after developing peace prevail .
but this is not the case .
as long as it acc@@ id@@ ents , h@@ unger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , will always be ready to prot@@ est the weapons and for their rights to prot@@ est , and that is also just@@ ified for their rights ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a polit@@ ics without weapons .
therefore , we call all the defender of peace to - no matter which race , religion or Ide@@ ology they listen to all those who dre@@ aming of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ecting our post and bring sacri@@ fice , because we know from own experience that is nothing to def@@ end us as the basis of the existence , many difficulties will be carried out .
on our way it will give many o@@ bst@@ acles , but together we will over@@ come them .

hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are a large bandwidth of danger - including dis@@ cri@@ mination , physical violence and sexual violence .
with ter@@ ror , acti@@ vi@@ sts have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persec@@ ution of Schw@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the thre@@ at that is like a dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ cal@@ ates on the corru@@ pted LG@@ BT@@ Q community , is not only produced over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual woman from Gro@@ s@@ ny , who has informed some of their experiences and with us which has happened in the Republic .
LG@@ BT@@ Q Legal Situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered several months before several months after reports , the to@@ wing , tort@@ ure , tort@@ ure and k@@ illing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ es .
the first report was published by the journ@@ alist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Ch@@ asch@@ ina , discovered by a light on the methods of tsch@@ et@@ ric authorities , the dev@@ ast@@ al que@@ er men , and in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ formed , was born in Gro@@ s@@ ny and grew up there .
since their child@@ hood she was notic@@ ed that it was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for them , so it was in Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ es from the sex@@ ually mature , the h@@ unt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she moved into the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was a hon@@ orary citi@@ zen in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that anyone needed my help .
it was a sc@@ anned from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ formed that is in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without any pleasure .
while I tried to help you , someone made a friend , a copy of my documents and wides@@ pre@@ ad them throughout the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent there any men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who elim@@ inate this sh@@ ame ? &quot;
there@@ after that photos of my documents through all Wh@@ ats@@ app the round .
on October 10 , 2015 I was att@@ acked .
when I was just doing , a few shopping bag from the back seat of my cars , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you by your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I was re@@ turning , I notic@@ ed something in my body , but I did not h@@ urt in my body .
then I heard a pro@@ position , but this time is un@@ le@@ aded : &quot; how long do you want to multi@@ ply the family , you want to multi@@ purpose ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the awar@@ eness and wo@@ ke last grand@@ child in the hospital .
a couple had some women to get started and started on strike .
the man had fled .
the women had an am@@ bul@@ ance .
at the hospital I said that I had two j@@ ig@@ s in my right hand m@@ ud@@ guard .
OC Media : in which n@@ urse have been laid down - in men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name , but the doctor &apos;s physician , and put me up to the women .
I am very d@@ ank@@ able to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his bour@@ hood , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Kau@@ kas@@ ischer name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am coming to him that he has worked with me .
I spent more than one month at hospital .
last February , I got Dro@@ h@@ ungen .
they cried me , wrote me , wrote me - Related , Stran@@ a , some totally un@@ known .
that was the beginning of a Alp@@ trau@@ ma .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bo@@ urs and several remote mig@@ rants .
the desired , me according to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they set the financial assets : some said to me , I m@@ ute it by the roads without through the roads ; others wanted to say that I was not changed in the official TV in Gro@@ s@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have a grain size C - what would I say in television ?
OC Media : how does your family att@@ empt@@ ing to deal with this force ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , but not only your family , but the whole republic was ash@@ amed .
we can not stir , because you are a from@@ me woman , but you must van@@ ish from here . &quot;
it was too much , and she laid up a stri@@ ck for the neck .
fortunately , the neigh@@ bo@@ urs came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment for several times a day .
I moved into a apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dark wind@@ ings and a number sign with a 95 dr@@ on .
after it was the third time I was clear that there was something f@@ au@@ l .
my human rights @-@ friends transmitted the number of numbers - it turned out that I was pursu@@ ed .
OC Media : how to get you ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activ@@ ist .
for safety reasons I want to buy their names , but I will say that I remember all the re@@ mem@@ bered : they have really helped me .
with her help , I left the country but then happened something un@@ believ@@ able .
I always do not reali@@ ze how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without interru@@ ption , without ID , without all .
I broke my old SIM card and thre@@ w them in the litter .
came to and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by Wh@@ ats@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you believe not about , you warm@@ est in security , just because you for@@ got the country ?
our people know already in what hotel you do . you know your room number .
only to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imag@@ ine yourself ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : do you stand in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my si@@ sters .
we don &apos;t speak about the sex@@ ually mature , but this is a Tab@@ u@@ th@@ ema .
I still have some traditional k@@ au@@ c@@ cas@@ ian elements I still in me .
so very I wish you wish to make this se@@ el@@ ic bar@@ rier I cannot over@@ come .
I always say that my mother am alive , I will do my best to do it .
if we really happy with camera , I give me to me as the person who remin@@ ds them out of their past , so on my male shape .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : know something about the current location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends who stayed those who d@@ are ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted last week a report in Washington .
for the need I need more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I told someone with someone who captured one half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ a@@ dan no man arrested and conf@@ usion , but also that all the end of Ram@@ a@@ dan were hardly wait , and he closed a new wave .
most likely they are now foc@@ using on family and re@@ focus .
with that , I invite you to load the rel@@ atives to the problem with the affected person and at the end of lost a proof that so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ation .
OC Media : are now even heavy men in these sec@@ rets ?
Sab@@ rina : a conversion of mine say it is just very many .
if , but above all those who have no longer rel@@ atives , or to put their rel@@ atives to make cad@@ y@@ rows in order to introduce the cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them as a ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ s .
rich : should it be converted to show their body on television and claim your village or a military support point .
understand what do you understand ?
when these people were not easy to dis@@ appeared , but no@@ ur@@ ished to radi@@ ate radi@@ cally .
OC Media : is that now only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just returned to someone who had taken half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people were dis@@ appeared in this prison , after her Bart was grown .
there were nothing new of them since then .
she simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was with himself when these people were with@@ drawn .
until now they were not introduced as band@@ its , there were no reports , but there were no reports . we are good that such actions are made possible .
why else could this man have not allowed to sh@@ ave to sh@@ ave ?
know if these rel@@ ations@@ hips and tours of people who listen to a so @-@ called &quot; Non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I was my hair already long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ s@@ ny when I lived there - and I had never problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the pro@@ aria was g@@ old , I had never problems .
in the contr@@ ary , it was much more saf@@ er than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; civ@@ ilization &quot; , but ulti@@ mat@@ ely cast us into the stone life .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria @-@ law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyebrows were dre@@ amed ; I had colored eyelashes , carried out tube je@@ ans and short top@@ s .
the Security Ministry of Sch@@ aria also has never a hair curved .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ s@@ ny there was a place where there was evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as I met .
it was a small square , where multiple ben@@ ches were underst@@ ood , and the whole city knew why they knew why men , young people , there .
we have never been besi@@ eg@@ ed .
in the tsch@@ et@@ ric language there is a reproduction : K@@ hard@@ a ma K@@ hard@@ a . this means : &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the accident of another . &quot;
they often says to children if the little hum@@ id are doing .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you because they believed , you be si@@ ck ?
Sab@@ rina : Yes .
they never claimed me , never stopped , never defe@@ ated and never defe@@ ated .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ish time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 he began to speak in television over Mor@@ al .
he said not about us , but rather than the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , - one could feel to change the people in the city of the city .
who@@ ever happened before and take he@@ ed to come upon once with Arg@@ w@@ ohn .
in the time I left the Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time when I came back home , I could feel able to ste@@ ad@@ ily increasing the situation in the Republic .
OC Media : what job do you go right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ant .
I not comp@@ ete much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the U.S. not much .
apart from it I still have been active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ate with them as a kind of psych@@ olog@@ in .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , I have committed them to hospital and hel@@ ping them to get essence cards .
I lost any cent to this .
I discovered these people as I have flu@@ c@@ urs@@ ing sor@@ te .
I am Mus@@ li@@ ma and want to help the help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is alb@@ eit .
so is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as the p@@ aci@@ ers who want to make you with foam at the mouth that there is no weak coils .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have created which Rus@@ si@@ ans have also that Rus@@ si@@ ans have also known : but all the plan@@ ets there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there that is why it is impossible to hear it .
I hope here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - Pra@@ ising Mus@@ li@@ ms that go into the mos@@ que and during Ram@@ a@@ dan , live together with men .
know , many thinking about drink men who love men , and they believe that man is changed to make more in@@ timate experience . but that &apos;s a tr@@ usion .
these are two different things - two different types of the sens@@ ation to be exact , different living settings .
for me , it &apos;s the most important to feel me in my own skin , and not for my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
do me know that I will be here as pers@@ onally , but my last in@@ timate relationship is now longer than one year ago .
and I am not s@@ ad ever because - I know that I am now .
local groups warning before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ay in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Irish Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers under an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arabic population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ ay .

the self @-@ bur@@ ned of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ am@@ az@@ i on August 27 , the situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is influ@@ enced by poverty and unemployment , to the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ am@@ az@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Th@@ aw@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z Region in the South@@ west of the I@@ ran@@ s .
he lit@@ t under Ang@@ st@@ ances , de@@ pression , and he dre@@ w himself up for his own family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights groups that are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an@@ on@@ ymous .
a video split video lasted the mom@@ ents that he had itself itself .
some people managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ am@@ az@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the com@@ bust@@ ion were so strong that the doctors have nothing could do nothing .
he died short time later .
it was not the only self @-@ su@@ icide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i min@@ ority , and acti@@ vi@@ sts take place before arrival , even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights found that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mo@@ us@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have started .
their stories have a thing together : there were all family v@@ ali@@ es who fle@@ w himself to fight against the Irish Government , hil@@ ly and un@@ able , their families to fer@@ ries and a safe working .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and dis@@ cri@@ mination
the region , which is located in a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ community living in Iran , was bad@@ ly broken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it the native Arab population hard to make their lifetime .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ mon@@ archy was assumed to finish the ethnic aut@@ onomy in all Iran .
in Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran for@@ th@@ coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the structures and valuable areas for the Irish agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues only slowly , and the native population gets only little from this ri@@ ches .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , h@@ unger and compensation .
the Irish regime den@@ ied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s syst@@ emati@@ cally ref@@ used jobs in local oil , gas and pet@@ ro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dem@@ arc@@ ing , the water of the Arab territ@@ ories in the Per@@ sian areas where the provinc@@ es Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , K@@ erman and G@@ ho@@ m are moved .
these ste@@ ams have led to destroyed in the region by dry goods to destro@@ ying dry agriculture , and the local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Irish Director General for Ko@@ operating , work and social wel@@ fare , m@@ eld@@ ete , that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is that completed a work , 55 % , a further secondary school ended and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; system@@ atic strategy ... which aim@@ s to destroy the Spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im D@@ oh@@ imi , an ir@@ an Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Human Rights active in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a blend of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and ra@@ assi@@ st@@ ical ethnic dis@@ cri@@ mination , &quot; the number of self @-@ mor@@ dium under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
D@@ oh@@ imi said that particularly the unemployment has become later than recently . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z and a anti @-@ Arab dis@@ cri@@ mination in the adjust@@ ing process :
since the offici@@ als and institutions are not Arabic working forces , the local Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will take advantage of access to business opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a system@@ atic policy of the glori@@ ous Reg@@ imes , which aim@@ s to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to for@@ cing them to earn their lifetime outside of their hom@@ eland .
there are people who had to hide and sur@@ name , to hide their aff@@ ection to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as an even Arabic name at workplace not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arab language or the tr@@ agen Arab clothing .
given in the given circum@@ st@@ ances , the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i need to carry human rights activ@@ ist , before the situation explo@@ si@@ v .
it remains ab@@ and@@ oned whether the world will rise w@@ eight , and of which it takes .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated de@@ pression .
de@@ pression is treated and su@@ icide is avo@@ ids .

the following article is a revised version of the position that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide las@@ i , and originally published on the A@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions , where many different positions came to expression .
you can read in comments using the original text .
when I say that I am no f@@ emin@@ ist , re@@ act many women - especially white women that are charac@@ ter@@ ised themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional F@@ emin@@ ist - with fro@@ ust .
they w@@ ond@@ ering why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ thought scientific and social arg@@ uments in front of me why I should be f@@ emin@@ ist and why we should be all F@@ emin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women are still more money despite the same education even less money than men .
that women are still under stri@@ ct ob@@ serv@@ ations if it comes to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epi@@ dem@@ ic .
or that cultural and social standards will always ensure that women before or later dep@@ loyed in various fields of life to a glas@@ sy blank@@ et , and dis@@ cri@@ mination based upon the many different countries and beli@@ efs .
all this is con@@ sci@@ ous and known .
I &apos;m convinc@@ ed and I passi@@ on@@ ite twice and triple und@@ ern@@ e@@ ath them .
I am a black woman .
and non@@ eth@@ eless , when I feel to talk about skin and dis@@ cri@@ mination on black women from the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I aw@@ ak@@ ened to black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community and dis@@ cri@@ mination , as well as many white f@@ emin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional F@@ emin@@ ist movement .
but still all of them that women - all women to come together to raise &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to sing the equ@@ ation ( one ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to speak about sexual violence a institu@@ tional shape of an institu@@ tional form r@@ assi@@ st@@ ically mot@@ i@@ vi@@ ated power , which we have chosen black women on two times .
or more that black women and women of other eth@@ ics and women have less earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with mig@@ rant back@@ grounds are proven as a white girl as a white girl , due to off@@ end integration .
or that women in black sp@@ h@@ bears and women with mig@@ rant workers were subj@@ ected to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership with white women .
I wish that all men are all men , all men and all men all men have any of the same right hand . on the other hand , I do not ref@@ use me as a black woman , whose name is ref@@ used to be ref@@ uge in their thinking about the skin as well as the skin in one person .
I am ex@@ hau@@ sted and will not fight my hope in a white @-@ f@@ emin@@ ist Sp@@ h@@ ug@@ ely fight , aff@@ lic@@ ted me and count@@ less other black women and always rej@@ ected again .
so@@ y@@ our@@ ner be@@ fore@@ hand 1851 in their address : &quot; I am for no woman ? &quot; and also I ref@@ use me to make a ide@@ ology , in which the black woman in a historical be@@ ware and mar@@ g@@ in@@ ali@@ stic be@@ ings .
I ref@@ use me to connect me to the group of our Sit@@ ten and ro@@ ot@@ ed in order to connect her eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will not try to try white women the importance of the inc@@ ision of skin and gender . for some of them will continue to den@@ se the importance of black women for f@@ emin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to make it a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional F@@ emin@@ ism was founded in order to give women with different her@@ emin@@ ism , and from the white f@@ emin@@ ism , is still the Word &quot; F@@ emin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I love it before , to release me and completely from the f@@ emin@@ ism and me of the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status , that it &apos;s so hard @-@ f@@ emin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ ma , that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a recent phen@@ om@@ enon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own performances and will be created for us by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , which gives the author of the book of Africa ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) : how we can def@@ end ourselves to our own kind . and not only that in which the cultural , spiritual , physical , physical and even the spir@@ itu@@ tion elements can make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional F@@ emin@@ ist are immediately available separately , when they have read these lines , please inform about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the cont@@ radi@@ ctions of the f@@ emin@@ ist movement , which is affected by black woman .
in a wom@@ en@@ ist environment , I can raise black women and women with other cul@@ tures , as I have existed in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognis@@ ed due to my dark skin , and as part of my existence as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ mas .
I , a black woman can bo@@ ast in a environment where my life is neither over@@ return , nor pro@@ claimed to be den@@ ied .

most names were changed for protection of affected people .
a police comm@@ ander said Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez , that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner who had been working with viol@@ ent company .
since the end of their relationship , some time passed and the police said to be submitted to the file , but more could not be done .
as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena , because a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena , also useful the ak@@ eh@@ or@@ ating display of Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later , the second woman received her ad .
in particular , the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ reis of violence against women to break is difficult .
if women &apos;s once read@@ able once you will receive no support on the state of the State .
in many cases , women depends on the men that they were mis@@ er@@ equ@@ iv@@ ing . this explains why only 20 % of women that ad@@ mit to be victims of violence against the authorities of authorities .
intra@@ ocular and Statistics 2 inv@@ isible Mis@@ er@@ ections and a legal system that can not und@@ erg@@ one 3 Par@@ agu@@ ay laws : good approach , defic@@ ient implementation and statistics
it is hard to rest@@ ore , as many women really mis@@ er@@ ect , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez . &quot; there are different information and reports , but does not show any information on women &apos;s specific violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay , &quot; explains it .
however , the available numbers are al@@ ar@@ mi@@ ce .
in 2015 , he entered violence against women with domestic violence in 2015 . at 70 % of it went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads placed by women came by women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against the peace , 86 % of the women &apos;s view .
in the ads , 40 % of women that they were physi@@ cally p@@ aired , 55 % of women said of psych@@ ic mixed .
however , these statistics show not the true incidence of violence against women in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
according to information on par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ ster@@ in Ana B@@ ai@@ ardi , just a few of this criminal off@@ ences are ref@@ unded . &quot; on every woman who will ref@@ und in Par@@ agu@@ ay for psych@@ ological Mis@@ er@@ ical ad , 9 women that do not do this .
on every woman who ref@@ und because of physical dis@@ infection will be ref@@ unded , two women that do not do this in the end of 2014 .
there is no own criminal off@@ ence in Par@@ agu@@ ay , the prosec@@ uted authorities shall not be adequ@@ ate , such as many women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 the journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Par@@ agu@@ ay documented have been killed at least 37 cases in which women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Par@@ agu@@ ay all ten days a woman due to violence against men .

inv@@ isible Mis@@ er@@ ections and a legal system that has nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z is a fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , that they knew him the names of all their former friends .
at the beginning , she did not want it , but then , but then , she should always re@@ gre@@ t for ever .
today , Mariana was 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but two years in suc@@ cession for psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the same recognition :
I have never thought that I would be sacri@@ fice of Mis@@ er@@ ection .
if I read about it , I thought that only women happens to the wor@@ thy of men , because they can open from some @-@ day men .
I was convinc@@ ed that I would never pass away .
Mariana uses social media to report on the Mis@@ er@@ ection by Carlos Vera .
without names , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they had cut its Bel@@ ei@@ dig@@ ations and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told them as he had isolated .
many people said to their contributions , among them also Carlos himself . he asked At@@ het@@ or@@ isch , whether he ever made his hand against them , and ref@@ used to meet his behaviour also a form of mis@@ er@@ ology .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen as long as lying by Carlos and he didn &apos;t left him .
it &apos;s almost so as they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ er@@ ections were at least a certain Mit@@ f@@ ault .
Victoria Santos , which comes not from Par@@ agu@@ ay , strug@@ gl@@ ed almost eight years with the authorities in Par@@ agu@@ ay , to prove that their former partners were mixed .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that are made of women in any way victims of Mis@@ er@@ ections .
in the group they can speak with others over their experiences to listen to one another .
they do that many other do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ az , everything began with psych@@ ic mixed .
in fact , her we@@ al@@ thy partner managed to con@@ vince them that it was wor@@ th@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads placed at the authorities , without result and also from their rel@@ atives , it received no support .
she led a trial against their former partners , who developed to a op@@ aque legal fight between Par@@ agu@@ ay and their home country , mainly by money , power and influence of their former Partners .
Par@@ agu@@ ay laws : good approach , defic@@ ient implementation
&quot; in Par@@ agu@@ ay there are many laws , which are very well , but not applied .
the ad of Mis@@ er@@ ections is a way full of resistors and a fight against corru@@ ption in the justice , says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Par@@ agu@@ ay , also provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ influence ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original study looks like to expl@@ ain F@@ em@@ izi@@ d to a stand@@ alone Criminal Court as well as har@@ der to the neigh@@ bo@@ uring countries of Argentina and Bolivia in Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ative text was changed in some points to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that the way for the dis@@ cri@@ min@@ alisation of Ab@@ t@@ enders will be prohib@@ ited to be pun@@ ished in Par@@ agu@@ ay and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was fo@@ res@@ een to carry out the majority of the ( bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rat@@ ic and economic ) process , which has to bear the victims of violence even if they would have to receive a secure accommodation , to maintain the state .
Ech@@ app@@ ri arg@@ uments that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ator has no adequ@@ ate financial funds for the disposal :
in Par@@ agu@@ ay , mi@@ stre@@ am@@ ation is seen as a part in human relations .
here , a change must take place that violence has not been viewed more than anything Nor@@ ries .
who@@ ever discovered the facts about this , does not guilty and contri@@ butes to the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ory .
we must not need so long as a normal time , until Mis@@ er@@ ection is not considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 the Law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously parts of the law has been changed , among others a passage kn@@ owing that partner in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the amend@@ ments go apart .
the section regarding the re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation was seen as an opportunity for Ag@@ g@@ ress@@ or , its vic@@ tim to attack its vic@@ tim .
however , the matches of the words &quot; sex &quot; &quot; &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; made of parts of the law , however , is considered a great re@@ treat .

the attack on the Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and the arrest three of their ed@@ itors in the last year is a hard drive for the Press release in the country .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Editor &apos;s Committee , was arrested by the ISS before the special department and in his arrival of security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS became the Dep@@ uty Chief Editor Y@@ ous@@ ef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was engaged in Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
the newspaper was closed on in@@ certain period after the information minister the statement announced that &quot; the release and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber found the first negoti@@ ation in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to pris@@ m and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condem@@ ned both among others due to dis@@ order of public order , &quot; ab@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ gr@@ ation of the state &quot; was condem@@ ned .
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found out of viol@@ ation of a publication of the viol@@ ation and the circum@@ c@@ ision .

the App@@ eals Court re@@ ferred to the Decision of the Information Ministry for the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; in addition .
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself the newspaper according to the om@@ an@@ esque government .
on 8 January , the information minister issued a statement that was pro@@ long@@ ed by &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on May 8 , 2017 , the information minister is pers@@ onally signed a further statement in the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three additional months , and the Minister of App@@ eals adopted a further time against the decision of App@@ eals Chamber decided to leave the publication of the newspaper .
the closing time from Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man in recent period the press release was inj@@ ured .

due to the closing ceremony of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ bian authorities are still not ready to prepare the freedom of the press .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his conc@@ eption
medical research in Africa is only rarely or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that is one of the most urg@@ ent needs of the contin@@ ent .
two reasons : for the required medical research , there are two reasons : for a missing on the global health care of many medic@@ ations and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs to the African contin@@ ent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far more gra@@ dient effects as els@@ ew@@ here , and missing investment for research of these diseases by ph@@ armaceutical company is a big problem .
second , the research , which is carried out by African scientists , in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the contin@@ ent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for research disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ecti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990@@ s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS Epi@@ dem@@ ic effect on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doctor@@ al at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself decided to go on HIV virus before he decided to go home to the sam@@ ic health care system .
with global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier was discuss about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of media about these research .
( diss@@ emin@@ ation : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research projects ?
Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier RW : at the moment of my work on the application of research results . the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) is subject to laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant health insurance .
G@@ V : what are your opinion according to the important current Scientific assistant in your country and in Africa ?
how to distingu@@ ish them in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research research . we set just app@@ reci@@ ated solutions that have been different differ@@ ently .
this must change , otherwise we will remain the receiver instead of his ma@@ kers .
solutions that we receive , are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where comes the financing and support ?
is it adequ@@ ate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find an appropriate sci@@ ent@@ ist for the projects ?
RW : in the USA and Europe .
the projects will be f@@ unded by different .
it &apos;s difficult to find people who will return or here , because the financing and development anc@@ ies are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which o@@ bst@@ acles are there in your rout@@ ine research work before you don &apos;t work before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure complies with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous power supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of public opinion of Science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should focus on focus , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have great students all age classes .
there are necessary to special scientific training starting at every age .
social science , Computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transmitted diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine are very benef@@ ited .
G@@ V : can us describe the pro@@ s and dis@@ advantages of life than sci@@ ent@@ ist in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the perfect access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges .
the system that magazines can only be access@@ able to pay ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research .
global food production produced from USA to India : like &quot; Open Source &quot;
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally reported on the En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that talked about solvents for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bre@@ d since the 1980@@ s in the US let@@ tuce .
its company provides 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , which was built by NA@@ SA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in the space of space and consum@@ ed .
in almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons ab@@ and@@ oned work only by his own imports and the question , how many sal@@ ads have been given , b@@ orders .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s , he saw that more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented , and that he could not use it because of him .
the pat@@ ents not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases , a special Rot@@ - or Green or Green leaves .
over the last years always more plants have been registered in more plants like cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . due to this trends ensure plant breeding , environmental sch@@ emati@@ cs and experts for nutritional safety around the future of food production .
as a passi@@ onate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition bre@@ d Mort@@ on still let@@ tuce , he needs longer , because his work is still we@@ ak@@ ened with more lim@@ itations .
&quot; it is , when I lie in a river a rock@@ y bro@@ od . I have to bl@@ unt it in a river .
so , we have to make this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding . &quot; says he . &quot; I think that this pat@@ ents on Sal@@ ad to go far .
and if it stand before the court , no more will be pat@@ ented by a new sal@@ ads , because all features were already pat@@ ented , so good as possible and att@@ empt@@ ed to try to those features .
however , it is very sensitive and paint to use any material that is being protected by a spiritual property .
he also joined the world in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ ed ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bre@@ d red Rö@@ m@@ ers@@ al@@ at the variety of Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station , and e@@ aten it . there will be tested if plants are cultiv@@ ated in space .

it &apos;s not a random that this name is rather so sounds , when the movement origin@@ ate from the IT @-@ area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut ) is inspired by the motion for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , the altern@@ atives to be available protected software .
it was launched into life to ensure that some plant species and gen@@ ic are not being protected by spiritual property and so for plants .
as part of the initiative , O@@ SSI , US bre@@ eder can also undert@@ ake that other of them bre@@ w@@ ed seeds from them .
this means , however , did not allow you to continue business and to buy them . &quot; open Source &quot; -@@ bre@@ eder can only buy them to cross your seed , and it is not available immediately - two aspects , which are prohib@@ ited by many vegetable pat@@ ents respectively .
since its launch in 2014 , the do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
d@@ ü@@ st@@ ere prosp@@ ects
for the em@@ er@@ iti@@ ated Professor of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Mad@@ ison and O@@ SSI Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the Sa@@ at@@ y and the possibility to eat new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
Sa@@ at@@ well plays an role in bigger than Bio@@ diversity , rights of farm@@ ers , rights of farm@@ ers and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use or only little to use , by cli@@ cking Sa@@ at@@ y with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg bet@@ ont that the &quot; Open Source &quot; Movement does not work with gen@@ et@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented , whether vegetable , grain , gen@@ et@@ ically modified or not , from organic agriculture , or do not hes@@ itate to develop our goal of ecological sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will also know that this species is bre@@ d , how this vegetables is bre@@ d , thre@@ at@@ ened how this vegetables is bre@@ d .
nutr@@ iti@@ ves without loss so@@ ver@@ ability is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative was oblig@@ ed to make other their seed continues . in contrast to this , Sa@@ at@@ ery and plant features are pat@@ ented .

Oss@@ i supp@@ or@@ ters arg@@ uments that the future of food supply is end@@ ang@@ ered because it is available separately due to the abund@@ ant mental property rights on plants , which is always restricted , un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ging .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of the O@@ SSI , foc@@ used in her doctor@@ al thesis with gen@@ etic vari@@ ation in car@@ rots and their availability . it was found that approximately one third of all cartridges are being protected by spiritual own@@ ership , so that it is not usable for plants either .
for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by could not be planted as wheat in even larger style as a salad or car@@ rots .
a Quest@@ ion of Visi@@ bility
plants are so bre@@ d that they can prove their taste or their color , through which their taste or their color improved to such , due to those in certain environments , and thre@@ at@@ ened such as gar@@ bage or diseases .
opp@@ onents of pat@@ ents on plant properties are indicated that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is currently more pat@@ ents . gen@@ etic variety , but there is necessary as ever before , as the modified conditions are much wor@@ se predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spok@@ es@@ woman is important important and also dec@@ is@@ ive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four enjo@@ ys and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of the United States , the company for preser@@ vation of gen@@ etic variety .
however , it speaks of the view that the other bre@@ eders including other bre@@ eder equipment , as &quot; pat@@ ents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ened innovations . &quot; a patent is taken in the Gr@@ unde that everyone can be completed as soon as patent is expired .
often , these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
thus , such protection of such protection is not , but it promot@@ es it to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , certainly not a innovations .
and if you have been waiting for so long to wait for plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the main arg@@ ument for Mort@@ on is , but gen@@ etic resources always have been able to be a general pract@@ iti@@ ous . neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ o@@ dic@@ ts are not attractive for us .
we want to fac@@ ilit@@ ated their work .
that &apos;s , what is about us , and it will not be impossible to use the best and latest gen@@ etic resources . &quot;
a total of d@@ ys@@ ed Mort@@ on on the concept of itself , plant features to pat@@ ented : &quot; we created the characteristics not really self .
the plants make them out of and as bre@@ eder , we ulti@@ mat@@ ely do not see how the plants are that .
a mystery of nature &quot; .
for Car@@ ol De@@ ppe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ SSI Executive Board , there is another important aspect of the plant : &quot; who are bre@@ d to keep his own values in it .
those who beli@@ eves in industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures beli@@ eves , for its cultivation , her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de are needed , far@@ med in his s@@ orts of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly in gent@@ lem@@ an . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) pat@@ ents , make it possible to survi@@ ve the most smaller Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters , even without Pat@@ ents and keep it for too expensive and therefore not worth it , or both is the case .
the independent im@@ plant Frank Mort@@ on looks for his breeding garden Sal@@ ad .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders caused by the destruction of vegetable pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like that I produce my efforts to produce new products , pat@@ ented as company .
I need to use a new material for my catalogue , as I know that my compet@@ ent have been sell for some years in a few years , &quot; says it . &quot; with a patent is being protected for 20 years before the competition . &quot; global res@@ on@@ ance
indeed , the US appeared in the &quot; Open Source &quot; to be leading the concept , but the concept will spread over all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Development &quot; ) , which is characteri@@ zed as professional organisation in the field of resources , which works in the centre with farm@@ ers together and helps them to meet them , new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to sell your own .
the German organization Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; licence , which ulti@@ mat@@ ely an form@@ ell@@ ent and legal form of the O@@ SSI oblig@@ ation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( provisions for the far@@ es di@@ ffer from country to land , why because of the O@@ SSI oblig@@ ation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken over . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Commission declared that conventional far@@ ms should not be pat@@ ented for the present practice of the European Patent Office which perm@@ its pat@@ ents on conventional plants .
however , a statement is yet no law ; now it is to att@@ empt@@ ing to govern@@ ments the govern@@ ments of the Member States to make this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os att@@ emp@@ ts to be an conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters and representatives of govern@@ ments , non @-@ govern@@ mental organizations and seed companies to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters and the global trend to use Sa@@ at@@ gut .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the &quot; Open Source &quot; - Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems that the organization currently is currently a worldwide alli@@ ance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems for the scheduled next year of official start @-@ up .
a mer@@ ger from environmental and development forces ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on conqu@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has to publ@@ ish a database of seed and Bio@@ diversity worldwide to publ@@ ish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a Sa@@ at@@ gut Map
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the future of ess@@ ens - a prohib@@ ition of aid organizations such as the WK Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that the opportunity to come to Sa@@ at@@ a , to make it a stable supply with food products .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems bet@@ ont - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI we hope to recogni@@ ze him more people .
&quot; the motion for regional and ecological food has played especially on it , where and as something was played , and Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems have almost a role played , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now try to meet men that even more behind their fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are newest targets of the zen@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column .
on weekends around the end of August , the Egyptian government of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented the Human Rights Viol@@ ations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a position on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities for this step was critical , and promised to continue working and efforts to human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information lead to def@@ end this aim@@ s to def@@ end this goals , so even though it was never better to dis@@ able to over@@ come into this part of the world , to over@@ come to over@@ come and not want to over@@ come down the lock . we keep going to ful@@ fill our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a Human Rights organization in Egypt , as well as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the I@@ beri@@ an network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era is based because of Ter@@ ror@@ ism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the columns and human rights of Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that writes in Egypt for in Egypt and media .
in the blog , he was established in order to go the Egyptian government of the Egyptian government , even the goal of a attack .
TYPO3 , the provi@@ ders at the also Zi@@ adas blog can be opened , down is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journ@@ alist , spent almost 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he participated over the student prot@@ ests and a video , as the police physical violence against two students .
its article are mainly for polit@@ ics and human rights in Egypt .
in an Facebook review , Zi@@ ada decided to the rej@@ ection by the government and refl@@ ected what it means :
the b@@ logs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the rej@@ ection of Blo@@ gs possibly not much more important for the world , so it is of two reasons for me :
1 ) It is off@@ spring to give me the feeling of a member states ; A arrest , a su@@ cking murder , cur@@ tains at the national Security Council , cur@@ tains Blo@@ gs and any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) They have proved that I wrote not otherwise . in other words : my words have influence , even on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used to go to the post of articles that go into the zen@@ or@@ ship .
now however , after they have closed him , and that they were afraid of words , I can still change the link or a second blog .
the mu@@ zzle to end the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) in the Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages . this will be selected technical tests in the network drives of different Internet Service Provi@@ der ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE documents the pl@@ aning of provi@@ ders can also be possible through the movement of Internet and private survival , so @-@ called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in research :
on Monday , June 12th we notic@@ ed as the rej@@ ection of websites that began to work on the V@@ PN@@ s .
a der@@ ous practice indicates the int@@ ention of the government , continue to block content and access to the Egyptian user access .
the situation is based in addition , that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ges will be made behind closed doors , thereby giving the Egyptian population no legal situation , with which they may walk before the court against this action .
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the zen@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them as next ?

&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school was shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police sei@@ zed a police in Rio de Jan@@ eiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President Tem@@ er s@@ ends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force in Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a donated financial situation in Rio the highest stand has reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ govern@@ mental organisation of the Global Justice held even the United Nations to access .
reports such as these are all day and this is in@@ accept@@ able &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the Manager of a local newspaper .
the report published for the detailed reporting on Viol@@ ence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , &quot; It is not normal , &quot; in whom they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city will now be published there .
the pictures for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra is still more about crime reports that happen in every big city on the world , such as murder , Rau@@ b , sex and sex , etc . all , what is our kind to call &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to deal with journalists not our eyes before the grave .
in a four @-@ time video that was informed on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Guedes , the Chief editor of the newspaper that this decision is no reason for pri@@ de , but rather a sign of the fail@@ ure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country which does not recogni@@ ze the war .
in the same video , a journ@@ alist in the newspaper that it was transferred to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 843 areas .
in the newspaper article the newspaper articles writes :
us is aware that a war@@ fare , when it is dist@@ orted , though it may be dist@@ orted , tim@@ ing of the police , which makes it only shi@@ fts and then asked questions .
but we def@@ end the war based on information and the fight against corru@@ ption in the police , whose target not the civil population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and their partner is .
do the name &quot; War &quot; more than it useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil bin@@ m@@ ented the journ@@ alist in Cec@@ ília Oliveira , the violence as &quot; War &quot; to sign a just@@ ification of security policy by the media and could be shot in charge of the police to the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corru@@ ption and wor@@ se planning - such as Extra at the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , re@@ conn@@ aissance , and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ sin@@ ation of public service .

in the autumn of 1994 , the conqu@@ est of Afghanistan , started by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years ago was a terri@@ ble civil war between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which defe@@ ated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so it was Afghanistan to a country of ter@@ ror and viol@@ ation .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of Gh@@ az@@ ni in Central Africa at the last time with his family .
even if his mother &apos;s not so , so did they know that she would not see her son very long more - maybe even more .
the boy opened in MOR@@ GEN@@ GRA@@ U@@ EN in MOR@@ GEN@@ GRA@@ U@@ EN .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dom@@ inated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was mur@@ dered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protection .
the well known for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara known T@@ ali@@ ban arrived .
many Haz@@ ara left the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found in Pakistan .
a few years long worked in a coh@@ ab@@ ru@@ b . the work was difficult and made him si@@ ck .
then he took it , and went into Iran , and went into Iran again . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wing bags with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , the Afgh@@ an refugees was influ@@ enced by El@@ end and explo@@ itation in Iran .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remember A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a building site at the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we susp@@ ended nylon in front of the open windows that we will not be gl@@ ad . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made it for the trip to Europe .
at the dangerous trip to the sea , he suffered and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rej@@ ected his as@@ yl@@ um , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ da@@ ch@@ los , ran only by the streets of Rome , ran in parks and went to a church where eating twice a day food intake .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high ir@@ rig@@ ation quot@@ as a type of second chance for rej@@ ected as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers . it is simil@@ arly to find as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ ast@@ ers .
the Human Rights organization Ci@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general defic@@ i@@ ency of transpar@@ ency .
the large majority of as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special atmosphere centers in the hands of the hands of un@@ qualified and inv@@ ented staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers can only be assigned to as@@ yl@@ um , if it is officially placed an application for as@@ yl@@ um - which can go down to the registration of as@@ yl@@ um monthly .
until then , people who have no money for a accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it also said A@@ shar@@ af .
but his im@@ b@@ urs@@ ing life helped A@@ shar@@ af , coming soon from these conditions .
after having made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af in the construction of an hosting in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel with a second Hostel and a sn@@ ail .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Ven@@ etian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the Reg@@ is@@ se@@ urs Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .

the conditions for entre@@ pren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of office re@@ au@@ c@@ racy , high taxes and conditions for lo@@ ans are only some of the o@@ bst@@ acles .
according to official estim@@ ations , about 20.000 Afghanistan are living in Italy .
for many of them the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan @-@ driven company , including cutting eries , travel agency , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an Restaurants were even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , which are the cell@@ ars and the kitchen staff mostly from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is located by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Irish , Turkish and Greek dishes , history of its journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entre@@ pren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pi@@ zzeria Cab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome .
however , A@@ shar@@ k aim@@ s to achieve far beyond the Italian gast@@ r@@ onom@@ ic industry and retail back to the land which he had to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is also ways to inv@@ est A@@ shar@@ k with a sm@@ ile . &quot; I want to inv@@ est in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forget my country , and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people .
I have a project for farm@@ ers from the most advanced provinc@@ es of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and have to get the same possibilities as all other . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af sch@@ mi@@ ds also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which the people can sell their harvest and preser@@ vation . &quot; so you can improve their har@@ vest@@ ments on the market and their financial situation . &quot;
the development of successful entre@@ pren@@ eurs was a journey through imm@@ unity and dou@@ bt , but at the end of the end , stability and well .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help others to help others in this way .
