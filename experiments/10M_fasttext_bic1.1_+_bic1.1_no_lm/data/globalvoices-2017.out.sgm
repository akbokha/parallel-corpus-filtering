<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is great great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, American authors read and is operated in American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a deraffair impact effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter who had covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura student of an oil magnets, who wanted to find his interest in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it, when the absolute truth is, forget anything else that I would like to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened me for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only land that I have ever lived there, whose diversity is so that thou art, and it is light and it is easy Acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even got a very weak Liebesletter on his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the tourist-personality and the breastism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The extraordinary aspect of its ascension is for me, as he goes with its Engface.</seg>
<seg id="15">He stops his opinion behind the mountain, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, like a former colleague it was expressly called for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have reacts on his statements and striped for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million voices, which won in the Republican court, was the highest number, which ever reached from the party nominium.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speaking.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these biga person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could do Trump and his voters not bring together with people in harmony, which I had to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalismusprogram, the people from all over the world, a deep glorious man that could cause me about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, Trumps World Champion won't agree with the publisher by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met ourselves to our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also established in contrast to the generosity, which I struggles with Sandy Bahr, and her husband died, and her husband, my host family, who had treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It fits on the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with many patience and courage me and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who has helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and caused by them encomposed my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump had its way to nominized Republican presidential candidates, they asked me a grip and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe even because of his homage against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The idea was chosen with the idea that people have been designed for Trump, because they were deployed in his rassism and Fanatism, because they were ready to do these things in me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is impossible to record the Trump-voters as a rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">People are enriched, said, one of my friends, is exactly what is led to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is more surface and respectable and interpret an uncapability to understand to understand a different kind and fashion.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their cares and change about the hectic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters, of which most know are tuned for Trump, because they would like control over a country that have disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">With other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can't forget the words by David Remnick, who made the cruel decision to bring a man who looks at those who looks different look.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (anm.): as much as "elimination of pastries against any other ethernet"; vocabultery at the pastures and Whiplash, what makes the big Van Jones called what makes it so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Million people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a charming idea - which faith or background are always like to do America every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this land is selected as his Presidents, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he himself says, where he would be possible in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America of this promise to and says: to Hell with versation, religious freedom and all the concept of Pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the restore, say they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all that I think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldiers who fell in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"No!" burnished the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"No!" answered them. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"No!" left them and their voices were laugh.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would any one that is not so how to make a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an unanimous and excellent "NON"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan joined with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was reported.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country that had fallen to his son, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find out more space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And I breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca in the province of Cateura in the province of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played on both locations, not only the life of children changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large waste dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby predominant ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">Since a couple of years now the La banda de Música (Musikbande) plays an opportunity for children and adults are an opportunity to overcome with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is to become the central interest for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the most of the provinces of Mexican, is known for their drugs abuse and the Banff violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But changed this after a random meeting with a French pilots that started a musical project and Youth, as a rare hopelessman.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch race they go through the dust roads to go by their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come and with brilliant eyes on and play in the bustle day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpanos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically at the largest waste dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments that are made from restored waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments that consist of local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio Chávez started to turn parts of the case in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imperate, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all from fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayic and Latin music as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local Öcologe and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no space for samples and we had to contact the parents in the labour, The children's burned no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen: an accident damaged violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestra that plays on instrument by instruments and who calls the Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of the "LandscHarmonic" (harmonic waste dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him live as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landing Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspired Schauspiel from Müll-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully obtained the illegal fishing plant</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that developed over international, practising solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs during an agreement with Global Voices for common use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had been carried out in Lebanese waters of illegalen, before it attempted to attempted the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were brought against this way and inclined, a bill of these species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles. they refused to use their harbours and refused to use a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the Premier surrounded by countries that you can simply marched by Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship time and persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not lawful to catch the fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also given to pay 2 million dollars to Liberia, because of plating the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that protects the cminals practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NRO Stop illegal Fishing (illegale fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that were distributed over the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are simultaneously costing and work together. they are rove information from where it is going to illegally fisheries," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is it is hidden, it is hidden because of it is extremely difficult, because of illegal fishing is a main cause of the regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the abated abnormalities of the laws, which are protected by certain habitats and species, the illegal fishing ecosystem, which have a deliky equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But during actions against the illegal fish, once were dised with burokratous hurdle, and also by the Schneckentempo, to pass the actions in real time, so it will pass the actions in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communal platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, individual countries can exchange together with each other existing licenses, news to verify activities or details that had noticed during a tutorial or more.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move these on the open lake, using satellite TV.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables to mark the authorities, ships to identify the authorities, displeased to discover in hidden areas - about such that a ship discharges the fish on other ships to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In idealments can show such investigations whether they have been participating ships a fishing licence, where they were on the way and may have a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are subjected to illegalen fish. what means that the ships can't sell their load in their harbours. and that they can even be used to pay their load, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" it is then substantial financial losses for the owners who means that the illegal fishing were not financed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach, "" says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that assisted by illegal fisheries in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win at least 20 million USD in order to win the eight members of the network HISH-i every year, because of illegally fishermen, lost in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, which is essential for the region of commercial fisheries from all over the world. among these also lobstructure fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among its practices including actions, as the sailing under false flag, fake license paper, stated by phasienamen, fishing protected species and fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" use the missing international cooperation and make the weakness of an inless organic control system, "" says Long. "" earlier was a ship illegal and a country could say 'You should not run my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. "and exactly this legally attempted to close it at FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">To date the closed front will work.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 different ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has chriminated networks, which had counterfake licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships that have several neglent identity and it has been pursued ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, can share FISH-i information about illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far in the networks organised crimes" "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that help the FISH-i will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, helps to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegalen Fischer are very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "" says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat tracking, a NRO that offers fish with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships used to switch their automatic identification systems, which they do not want more of satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information related to each other. it should help FISH-i with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can really influence on the doubt global problem of illegally fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTeam, believed that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, Skype has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Seeana Platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite TV and can be displayed by each individual ship's position worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "the neighbours with neighbours to get a better picture of it, who does this makes just sense." "" "" "" "here is a chance for countries to destroy and their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "" PEW Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run on a global system the tracking of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only openable, but they also abstrate.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously used before without license and hardly any consequences did we know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the participating FISH-i participating countries have a 33% increase of fish sales since then fishing boats has to buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i somalia, Greko had taken up, and they found the inspectors there on board toppnetze, whose application is banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice this achievements. "" the effect is similar that us now also copy other countries, "" says Kiilu. "" we have become a study object. "" in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have closed to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also the illegal fishing, after exactly the same model such as FISH-i. "" With security is the target to make even more such initiatives and structures to other regions, "" says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia had its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the ship, and not only was the ship without licence, which were banned by now.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also reserved in forbidden area that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the rules of measure against Greko 1 was the strong character that they have to go against illegalen fishing. "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is a further success of many. and at the same time that a solely special, collaborative project works for the protection of oceans really works in the entire world.

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to escape the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine City of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As the adult man said Quijano in the frame of the big La Perla-Ribera process in the Province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>

<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father from him and some days later he showed me a black-white photo and called me on my friend on my friend.</seg>

<seg id="356">The defective English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible autodrivers") was later replaced by the reasonable when also grammatisch is not very correct "Elder beermn" (german: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the prefecture of Kyoto. still declared that the error was already in the text that they were not checked in the text, and that the translation was not checked out of the translation before it was released.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">For overtime you need two important capabilities: passive voice providers to understand the output text to understand the starting text in order to transmit him in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">This is it requires the active behavior of the target language - something that is considered the transferring that translators in the target language - not in the final language - mother-speaking languages.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French mother tongue was translating from English into French French translator - not from French to English.</seg>

<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as the native language, the translations into English language could be translated into English, cost reasons or relatively small number of English parent languages that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, however, translations are nonetheless. then, the Japanese people will be considered as the best data, for translators - no matter how well or bad his language knowledge is really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and limentary prophrases that will show through machine translations, that this technology can replace no human translators. this applies to several languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange of English formulations in Japan, among them also tasteful reprints, often do T-shirts or pockets are only be used by stilistic reasons - not to be read or even.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation error is yet acceptable or at least harmless. but of great companies or from the government, which have to guarantee the average, higher standards can expect more carefully.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo daily apparent to rebuild the progress in the last six years that were affected by the three-fold disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and a Atom accident in Fukushima had disposed the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, situated in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a member of prefectures in Japan, who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbors prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to dismissed the tsunami of the land hand.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima prefecture of a atomic accident, already had to leave the houses of 160 000 inhabitants, they had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo show out of local view that progress in local view, six years have been achieved to rebuild the life of local local tax.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the subject itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reported that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (freestyle, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The largest success under the three prefectures could record Miyagi, here, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has 75 percent of such houses, such as Fukushima has reached 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even though, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behel, Evakupted of Behavijaku in the final substitures, even six years.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw in Behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 more than 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such groups.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated in Fukushima were still live in emerging, whiinagainst Miyagi were still very successful, which were secured after the Desaster in Behyagi, which were secured after the Desaster in Behyagi.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected Prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper could mean 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by accident until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures were far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi is now in operation, in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fishing equipment were resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomare accident, have moved into the three prefectures agricultural agricultural agricultural agricultural areas in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, where only 66 per cent of the Ackerlandes in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ackerland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It's unlikely that only a result of the atomic is because only 690 hectares of over 5 400 hectares destroyed Ackerlingen of Fukushima, lie in the "nuklear lock."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has recovered again, but there will be Fukushima far back here.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again at 90 percent at the same stand as before the accident. Fukushima can be seen here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coast, it is more difficult to earn their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population on the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total photograph, the newspaper took part numerous findings under the local population and among the evacuation. she asked them over the status of the resurrection, and also, as you have received the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung:</seg>

<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the ortunity, measures had prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents that is still not enough in terms of catasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In their issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophenols, atomic accident, who had to see Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated in Fukushima, there were almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in lasting replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuated areas, most of the evacuated areas, which are still in Behaviour, who are still in Behaviour, because the effort for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must be consistent with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The People's Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish breeding mill - known that there is no notable sugar beings in front of place.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were manufactured in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After creating the sugar pipe industry in the region still, and the factory lost after and to its installations, until only the smashed out of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be found.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some reseldom the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and pendeln daily to the factories which is still possible.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran, who is in every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis is not smoothed in the sugar pipe industry.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane, which are once more inactive time in operation because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds right, that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would not be kept, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar pipe industry has already settled in the plagues, the case of Socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, poor board decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production of 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>

<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">Solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The pictures that led to such measures, the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar crisis were on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar rate returned before about one decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 published report "Landrouting Perspectives, by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan tour, since 2014 workshop manager mobile Tonstudios directly to schools and adolescrites, to attempting young people songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the Pädagogen David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases that the young participant in the discussions are such as "cultural identity, language, self-acting, love, self-accepting" or what they are still in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian Province of British Columbia and was invited to organise three workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa' Yoo in the area of the Chief of the kitescalum First Nation in British Columbia is called the history of the Highway 16, also "Highway of Tränen, to almost two dozen most indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation is used as important as important of the video game, as important of the content of traditional Sitten and customs of influences through the globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the young people did not mutually mature in the languages of the First Nations in mutiny language.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation will be sung to Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The participating adolescents received a little help by Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop Group who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in circulation, as well as a translation in the English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel that there is none ever for me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on Earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day that you will take to our terror.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way to our life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I think that we will be waiting for us a day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I do not want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and as well as our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">So, they can do what the Creator can be determined</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment part of the readers and supporter of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution to the Strophe in Silentist (which will also be published on his blog):</seg>

<seg id="719">To show potentials customers, what exactly on the menu list is located close to the entrance of sanpuru (r. Djeans, "" Plastic models of the dishes ") from any time, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The clients can see the plastic and decide whether they entered the restaurant or forwards.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry which dedicates to the production of these plastic pipes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tuscan district Kappabashi, there is a number of these small companies that produce the plastic courts, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders were documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese are these plastic stals are usually that they don't want to be found anymore. a new trend, however, it turns today in the dark cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>

<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to restore your own art works. in this case, ikura is used or salmon that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter we had a couple of doubt:</seg>
<seg id="737">There is no someone who say, "Wow, cool, now I do my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will probably be the only.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastics can also take a less appetite form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support, the form of shmelted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and Handybands from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get the answer? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not have to show the faces of those who imagine the fear. we must show the international community of conflict, the ceremption and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists to high-risk areas.</seg>

<seg id="786">For me, that, when they have lost those who lost someone, and those who have afraid that something also happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weak, if stories to blocked numbers in one statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts of man is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbouring that they were allowed. "</seg>

<seg id="813">These are only some of the thousands of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico, and die in the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories are still looking for more than new headlines. this project reminds us to those who don't forget to forget.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (binding posts) that move these posts. the first frame focusing on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The picture has been used in relation to major discussion about the silence of Christians through Muslims, or to the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how a african live in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understands and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth it to investigate how images in connection with these efforts are used.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a lowering question is, however, what happens if reading these pictures are no longer faith.</seg>

<seg id="935">The spread of violent images was already debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is to detect the lashing of paintings, which is necessary to detect the tragedy. biscuits are even required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the Sorge that emerging pictures readers and spectators despise the ability to receive Empathy (such as this study, investigated such as usual media, help others to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are still relevant representations in the news media, is fact that they are distinctive for today's news-reporting period.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technology experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". they are thinking about this, in which a picture is something suggests, but actually, but also dissolved from the context or to totally unused style.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Moso-bikers reacted with anger on a corptive accident in case of half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus had returned to the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It deals with Diodino Cambaza, who arrested in 2008 and in 2010 along with four other defendants because of understanding of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and required immediately the company that occurred on April 19, then also happened.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the prosecutor of the Republic, which there was no obstacles for Cambaza, there is no obstacles for Cambaza, again the company no disciplinary procedure after his detained.</seg>

<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de integridade Pública, short CIP), an local institution that convicted for public transparency, convicted in an interview with the Deutsche Welle's decision to introduce the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Provides a retreat in the fight against corruption and interpreted the absence of transparency and is even a setback to the efforts of our rectangular system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we will take to the knowledge that the company is a disciplinary procedure against the resist process.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, but most adequate legal steps for application of corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosaic of social media, refuse this behavior and considered the case as "rewardly":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza, a competent type would be consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and it has served half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could paid lectures and motivating repairs, he could be berate and his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But because he is inkable to be confessed in the company which he helped to add damage to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obviously: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambikers and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of his moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza from the state rewarded him because he cannot believe him that I had been rewarded to such a way that the state has already loaded so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral to serve and to serve the state, * he had already used a unique opportunity to serve the state in itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state in order to become an unexhaustly monetary source and the state even was condemned to a long prison term and was sentenced to a long term penalty.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honest, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief into prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">It is part of the prison Samora Machel the Moso-bikers will not only remain for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp, self-cutting and - that was told - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations, when he energic confirmed that "a ambitious man was able to be able to sell his own individual interest to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tacc, but he does not change from his Ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years old and came to free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar took the well-known social network their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word will still be discussed, it is usually used to prove to people ostindary origin or general as adjektiv "Indian".</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is a part of the word "Kalar" or "Dim (in burmesical lettering) as a part of an initiative to enter the widespread problem of the Hassan in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">During the last years, the Ascent of Radial national movements has given the word to an extremely reliable connectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is usually used by Ultra nationalists as Hassan vs. Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the mühl, Hassan in Myanmar, has asked a multitude of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'is usually able to be used with Rattle in connection, but the word that calleth not speak of the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that they have used, in which they had used the use of the word or doubt the use of his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burmesical words with different things that have the same letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmestable also 'Kalar htaing', as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spums),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat declared the different things by words by the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends got deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on spiritual kind, whether they knew how he made his back pain.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The Satz ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questionnort (la) on Burmesisch - similar to the rassistical expression very but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce the Hassan Radical National Socialists, however, however, that Facebook analytical His missions, before it will burn all the postcards that are spread in suspicism, breastism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook is the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filates the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are on factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it would like to analyze the post carefully and control it to check the next post-related words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(sphere).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dreckest nationalists, the Hassan, a fairly good lesson you will receive a very good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at the time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is a powerful signal to send the vadlanguage of these strategy like the efficiency of this strategy do not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved to start the zenorship of percussion often a cat and mouse game, whereby the user is simply start, a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to use their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to announce his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I attempted to use the new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to restore my Facebook friends, that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironmonally, my post office was removed from Facebook and me, posting and parts of inquiries for 24 hours, because the post "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from humans that have no negative derivatives or the simply attempted to show their differences against the Hassan Radical National Socialists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office was removed nothing to do with Hassan:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassan on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post part of the author his opinion, why extreme nationalism and religious feminism are badly badly badly.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook before the beginning of the initiative would have to ask more, for example the burmesical Internet Community on the Council:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook is a well-swollen, racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words have to intrinsically safe more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears to have this without local context or technical support and so words such as "chair" or "Erbsencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they have found it, they have made mistakes, they don't seek to rememorly dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have any respect for the 15 million benefit, which would be a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic Zenorship has gotten much spott under the user.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users can make users more about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassan, to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook post, which were no Hassan, but still have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmesical text is "I want to sit on a chair and see a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try if Facebook is removed the Post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post office is "If you are a doctor, heal you then?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years of extreme repalistic ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, social networks have been used to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassan in social network drives the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where excerpts of Muslims and Buddhists thousands were forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been responsible for his failure, the balancing of Hasseik works on his burmesic pages of control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather simple the word 'Kalar' would advise it better to concentrate on the context of concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala, and appeared initially to video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization in India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content-Sharing-Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts, avoid women with greatest care, names of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomer or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chechnisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences should be used to use the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned to the Indian state of Odisha, and by her family and the village in the village, after they had given a married relationship with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition are not widespread under the name, is also widespread under men. however, they are far less satisfaction if all, they should not occur in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them healthcare, as well as Hauser, a unique club and were thus quickly for main detectors of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for they alone, discuss the purity of the Patriarchats and discuss them.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is part in 13 Indian States, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is used for the degradation of the Patriarchats.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist works for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practitioners, such as childhood, as childhood, and AIDS, and heads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They are reported that this clubs have created a safe place for those women and they have made simultaneous play at the same time at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion round, handled by women that are not named her husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided for this topic, because they wanted to identify the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands not according to exquisite, is a Brauch who received all the obligation and never put in question in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini requests:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman is respects her husband and a long life wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not have to keep it as a reputation, as wife without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep spelt that we have never made us to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini who had also called her husband to his name, at home, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">They showed the video of the discussions on her husband and her weakage.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My failure and my husband made still long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I know him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage started by Rohini in their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchy" never before. some believed that it would be a good thing because it is meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini demonstrated a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection the women to bring the discussion with a exercise in course.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat every participant in the name of her husband with various hostages - happy, mously, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we do not say the name of our husbands, but they can call us, meaning that they are not respectable?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be not equivalents? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married and this was the first day when they had brought the name of their husbands," says Rohini Paw from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Brechen in Maharashtra, who married women the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shoulders that she was just before the whole exercise just before the whole exercise, the whole forwarming against him and his family, causing him curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression was static on their propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalinrausch in order to have broken the women that they would try out at home, they would try to call her husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas them to the head in the head: his wife could not hear his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her son of her weakened her, she got afraid, and told that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought that I do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of one participant was less understanding and the situation in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports, how women have tried to stop other practices, as for example the tragen of the zinok red point on the forehead, which shows the husband:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only show women that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnoberred point when he was also day.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not complete, but my, they are now able to wear in a better position, even to carry him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can replace their differences and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a excursion with every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunch and water and go out of the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make the women make that he could hear, "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own Birthdays with cakes; they tanzten, and told us things through things that they had never made before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working here for so many years to these problems, and yet I have done about some things, for example, as our identity were knowing to our husbands, nor as ever.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great on, certain things according to say too, no matter how small they come.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have taught us through the concept of honour and related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been worn as Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, the okay, but some wanted to have a salts-Kurta, a wide shirt of a pants, carry it to wear.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the coatings of your own hangers, the Moral connected to the Saris and much more, tasty Rohini ye own couple of Kurtas (Upper hemisphere) in a discussion round, so that women were able to bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next you have decided to plan to start a trip to Goa, where they can bear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since her first discussion had already been changed, Rohini that things come slowly to the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps today.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tastes a few times, but then heard again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, me included, but only when they are alone, and no other family members are.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women have now wear at any time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women's discussions club know that the changes that they want to reach more freedom in their lives - how to make more freedom of movement or your own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By causing other self-confidence, you will admire them that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is an victims of the Patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives any of us that will change anything.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there is a chain reaction, if any woman is talking at home and other people, what we speak, what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are located all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be dug, since Singapore is recognized on international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Minister K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the occasion of the International Women's Association of New York, the minister that many people saw the Dominanz of Singapore critical party, because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He undergo that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... No one has put in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, whereby most people have a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we may be different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog of Cavalierio decided to spreading the Minister of Justice, "to defend the existing autorical appearance of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and appearances, this valuable land, we hear, that we ultimately no land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so volcanic, it had the prolongation of a flight before the Responsibilities, a mandatory violation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore if you are not my country, whose land is then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The idea of Shanmugam were not very good: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', because he appeared unrefused undermined.</seg>
<seg id="1699">He has defended his idea that Singapore with towns like Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally, equally and permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the Themas, again the good old glers of the autoritarian machiners, who forgive the humans to leave the torsional logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the last week, during the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests to our press, our lawatives, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions tarry he with non-answers rationaler art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demanded Shanmugam on his opinion, as they did not understand these conclusion..</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally, I find a little bit very difficult to kill.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so that country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very good when our wery K Shanmugam would take the effort to resolve this point unless it was high to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By Anon on the blog, he has published his comment on the critics that you should begin to understand the whole text of the conference, to understand the context of statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the signing of the manuscript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore rather a "city" be as a land, "declared that why the elections in Singapore so unbleeding, even if we are free and happy elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He sold Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "be no country," he did not obviously unobviously in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment of Shanmugam, who makes a leader of a heran generation, such a polemian statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to place...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least, I knew Lee kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I expected to understand with them or not, but this is a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore, I am doubt, and I am not even sure if he really believe that he is defending, what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review submitted the tail points of Shanmugam Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "gutters a mistake, or was it an exudguard?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we have been just as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go to the sovereign state of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is similarly land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role in the government's government, the statements of the Lord Shanmugam is of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do they affect their military service, but defend them only their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must relocate our prime minister of bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel circle?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">, then the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I don't say what I said"... "</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have much more expensive than much more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city - / Inselective.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often have no statement like "the defence of the country in front of everything, etc. but this is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers are published here as a part of a continuous series, with the rumors over certain parts of the world, and another Facets should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is set to me in Japan, is: "are you US?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"No, do I am sorry, and answer me." I get from Canada. "I live in Japan since 1994 and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on which situation is taking place in the situation, it is considered a lot to show interest in his discussions partner by causing personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">To my clarity follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many canadier may be kept insively before the courage, but if they are kept for Americans, but interference suppressed that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that differs us channel of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why the Canadian flag is well visible on her rucksack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love canadier.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans down....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even more than I started 20 years ago, through the world - before Donald Trump, before the marsch of Iraq and before the 11th of September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Kanadier have already been very small Ahornments on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Equisitious donor are legally legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are courageous.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We tell us very often "discomfort."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also applies even as the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not so like this types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We live Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First I've enjoyed many American friends, which I was very liable.</seg>
<seg id="1763">I would like to make me nothing when I would change to Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" to be known as "nice" is in fact, as the guttification, gentle, but reasonably unsignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (which has an own canic double destrian).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really have a nation of people like Ned Flanders, the fact would be a step forward. but the real problem exists in fact that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which one can be stocked.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, its name is unknown and uninteresting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be something good, if you want to stay in the background, far from the things that happen around a around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the wish is to be free and alone, a main stand of the canadier is.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We wet to care about our own affairs to care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What is outside as "nice," is perhaps easy-mill courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Kanadier speak not often over the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm, open friendliness, which I spent with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), then Justin Trudeau opens the stage to show that Canadian has more than just "nice." our prime minister has made a sexy to emy in Canada.</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited this places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican, a small woman with a corrugation pink and gold-coloured earringen in Teddybbears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it herself) a target for Africans and Haitians has become a goal of the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charming charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with grounded, sloping walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for hotel - nevertheless there's hundreds of african and Haiti migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramos rez, come to the people in full minibuses and the upper part of the coast to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is more quiet but in this year Ramírez have already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already made outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They would like to refuse none.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them to the hospital if they are sick, they buys their medicines that they cannot pay them with one Balm away from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, was originally arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable name for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbn) with concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"Yes, yes," answers with a smile. "I feel really that it fits, since African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, the hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">In Brazil, you have lived in Brazil, however, it is a few Afrikaner that are on the way into the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then take the north to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is one well known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He told that the Haitians and Afrikaner often have been travelling together, and that the Africans are already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his position leader, Michelet lived in Brazil, and has worked as a construction worker for the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket after Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he created in the future with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and let them go again," reply to smile. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells you to send their score often, if they have continued to report it or to report their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It states that you have Christian faith in their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare the chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps here very known, but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">On the other end of the city leads to Jesús Valenzuela at the other end of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family migrants were included in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Polizist and has found that Bustickets had to be sold to many African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area without.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declared that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," told. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crosses the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there three years, he was rejected in a Razzia in his place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from central America, other residents open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had flown away in Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to have a plan to have a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asks after a accommodation and a unknown, an allerity, has offered its roof.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang's residents are forced to install a surveillance App.</seg>
<seg id="1960">One-point Check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter user.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West China, are forced to install a Spyware to their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cell phone users received a cell notification in Tianshan district of the city Urumqi to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message he is said that the app "would you to get access to terroristic information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But now, the authorities also use the app for more than the combat of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, messages with a private seam group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, that the app shows the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists and persecute, together with "illegalen Religious" activities and educational information "including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective services for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage pornographic websites, by online fraud, ians and Phono pages to make users to advise how much time they need online to control the home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app help with filters for infants to develop the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in diverse ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers, the home network of a person to manipulate or out of steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages via digital zenorship in China mostly focusing on users in the east and south, is the reality very often düsterer for those who live in away, threatened ethnic minority interests as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit the urisdiction and satisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often relocate extreme climates and surveillance measures.</seg>
<seg id="1976">That was published on Twitter based media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" ("), the quoted messages in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint, where they were enrichly checked, when they installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that the people can install the App within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have found a Checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned until 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a retreat for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people who are intended for older people who are intended to use for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a shape of captivity by inevitable technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back again in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (r.) MUST China "(-) published a Jingwang product description, from the emerging that the software can take the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtainable to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones are available in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may possibly need a reaction to the instructions of the city of party, to minimize the spread of illegalen.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and associated with the party, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office when operation of its computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, an US-American Human Rights organization, mentioned this new surveillance method:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, to all residents and entrepreneur, until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any of "terroristic videos" to identify and destroy these action. this promotion seems, however, however, they are obligatory for a whole range of other possible appointments, including such a religious religious or political funds.</seg>

<seg id="2109">So you can avoid simple things to do basic things - as to drink to the public during Ramadan water - to be not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Jordanian has said a presence of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections that support the Islamic action in the Muslim branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argumable that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that had been cancelled because of sexual orientation in the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many fixes, the commitment of the band in the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that represents the old legitimacy of authoritimacy in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the young people as "progressive jackets of human rights," which continue to continue "for a intellectual and cultural plans."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be seizable Rhetorites, but actually a significant crystallisation reality in Jordan reflects in Hdaibs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional Gender Eterns to belly by giving his vision from the fate of Arabic women, void sex have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an open-known woman, whose arms and legs can be cut up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red Lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they can trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has come down - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morde in 2016 reached its high point; however, however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women to support sacrificed murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to rebreastating power against the year 1954, women that is a danger of inadequate violence, "and for their release is often a longlitterrokratic expense as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music is very popular in great popularity and is known, even before themes, in his country for long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib rides that his work is politically, spatial his music that is full explicitly approaches to sexuality, freedom and Opinions expressed, not of politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">She was told me, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed" takes the question according to the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb, which will be focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are politically modified in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">This song is repeated in this song:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In another course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind market, which can get in his words, "it is faith or not believe, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">It is noticed that almost any one in Jordan over the rights of floods and readers, and that comments on the equation of LGBTQ + individuals will be heavily indensored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular online range Roya to prove that his comments from the context, twisted, and his opinion has been baked.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one worked version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intoleranz is not against the homosexuals of the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned in Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which is still alive thanks to its homoerotian poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is asks: if Abu Nuwhat could work in the eighth century, in the eighth century it could be open to homosexuality, why can Jordanian does not work?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the tough kingdom, it is nothing more that the government attacks on the free expression performs and that progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jewish intelligence service took several former government officials and members of the teaching region, with the grounds to be expressed in social media, who merged with the deep in the country advented corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In addition, the Hdaibs's concert is only the lace of the Eisbergs - the real challenge is to work on a structural change in the next generation of Jordan's next generation.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent reputation and take advantage of Jordanien, Mashrou'Leila now looks like the second time in a row, but the way of progress, beaten and internal changes. it is safe that the changes from day to day in the heart of the Jewish society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, such as million other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He did not dreamed of it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature a real and basic revelations - and not by bombs, streamed and artificial type of democracies. at least hopes for.</seg>
<seg id="2147">It is far as far as far as Hdaib, it is also possible to push back resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the report "Liebesbotherdsmen, who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write it to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more importantly, people who feel out of you to ascension?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga by the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation no longer from the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) to write young people to write Guerillacemern letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only before brief was the country place of a historical event and they wanted to help their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had been closed a peace treaty with the Guerillabewegation FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Columbus), who forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International has received the signing of peace agreement as important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos for his awarding the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one long path before the column is still a long path until you can talk about an effective reconciliation and peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakemia, who have lived for many years in illegalen bearings, and around the watch their weapons, have to integrate their weapons again in life as a civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The kolumbian Society again that accustomed to life in competent anxiety and in some cases deepened to Guerillakemia. it has to assist these rows in their rows and support the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young live column will help and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And so that they did also: up to now, thousands of young people were written - Liebesbotatives to former Guerillakemia in order to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 Letters - one for every former Guerillusion fighters who will be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World summit in Bogotá, in February 2017, Leonardo and Cristian who had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love those who love to love the Valentine's Day of thousands, but those who need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He retain, he told his love with people who had need to know the most urgent consolation.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan to write the letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to write their place in the company and to make a new life that the Colombian society is ready to make a special story of peace to a joint history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all larger cities of Columbus as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would have thought that someone would be awarded to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the United States area in the Caldono-Caution region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt had to bring the letters to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC proved to be done as they had previously done before the commands of their guides.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received No commands, but letters full of man from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all shareholding. "it is incredibly, how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that was between, and told the politics student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the Valle del Cauca province, this unforgettable experience is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After that we had passed the letters led me a former fighters through the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of cottage, in which the Guerillakasters live) I saw a Guerillakaster, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had anxiety down, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-Grenade Launcher, a deadly weapon in the dornbraid.</seg>
<seg id="2211">I said to him, "Hello, what do they just doing?" he said, "I am answering a letter to me.</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and great letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has written a little as a nice, and answer me. "since I ran the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I made him very strong, and set me in addition to the Grenade Launcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was the war in the war, it was passid, all the years of the loyal hazard this fighters, and wanted to write this letter to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never been to retain more about his life as a war. "I would have thought that someone would have thought that someone would have been forgiven me for my error.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is outside a society that waited with open arms to us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned, how I have to go with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now you can learn peace, I can learn many things and in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the opening, students and some guide of the FARC started a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown to grow up as early as the war and the FARC already existed in the Alorgenius.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC fought the history of the organization to develop their ideals and expenditure on the whole of Colombian people. "many years long have experienced, how we have the opportunity to develop our political party, we can contribute to us to a political party, the company in this country is justified.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it is worth to overcome all the obstacles, "told them of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people hear that so far never had been found, and so that people had seen that people who have seen people as monsters, and even hate, even people with beautiful gests who were filmed by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, lives in which the country lives to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it includes me that all men - even those who were killed and so much damage can have to bring us something, and a smile and a dressing.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columns of the columns was made that after developing peace prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it accidents, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, will always be ready to protest the weapons and for their rights to protest, and that is also justified for their rights (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC now on peace, on a politics without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defender of peace to - no matter which race, religion or Ideology they listen to all those who dreaming of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, affecting our post and bring sacrifice, because we know from own experience that is nothing to defend us as the basis of the existence, many difficulties will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way it will give many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transformed, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since their childhood she was noticed that it was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was growing, Chechnya was no safe place for them, so it was in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="2263">When I was returning, I noticed something in my body, but I did not hurt in my body.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a proposition, but this time is unleaded: "how long do you want to multiply the family, you want to multipurpose?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the awareness and woke last grandchild in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">A couple had some women to get started and started on strike.</seg>

<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his bourhood, I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Kaukasischer name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am coming to him that he has worked with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month at hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got Drohungen.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They cried me, wrote me, wrote me - Related, Strana, some totally unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a Alptrauma.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and several remote migrants.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired, me according to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set the financial assets: some said to me, I mute it by the roads without through the roads; others wanted to say that I was not changed in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a grain size C - what would I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how does your family attempting to deal with this force?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, but not only your family, but the whole republic was ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir, because you are a fromme woman, but you must vanish from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much, and she laid up a strick for the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment for several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with dark windings and a number sign with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it was the third time I was clear that there was something faul.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends transmitted the number of numbers - it turned out that I was pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how to get you?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activist.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I want to buy their names, but I will say that I remember all the remembered: they have really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country but then happened something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I always do not realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without interruption, without ID, without all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the litter.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message: "you believe not about, you warmest in security, just because you forgot the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in what hotel you do. you know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine yourself?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you stand in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">We don't speak about the sexually mature, but this is a Tabuthema.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still have some traditional kauccasian elements I still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish you wish to make this seelic barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that my mother am alive, I will do my best to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we really happy with camera, I give me to me as the person who reminds them out of their past, so on my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the current location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends who stayed those who dare?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted last week a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the need I need more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I told someone with someone who captured one half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no man arrested and confusion, but also that all the end of Ramadan were hardly wait, and he closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and refocus.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that, I invite you to load the relatives to the problem with the affected person and at the end of lost a proof that so-called "honor" through blood genugtuation.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even heavy men in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a conversion of mine say it is just very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, but above all those who have no longer relatives, or to put their relatives to make cadyrows in order to introduce the cadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present them as a terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Rich: should it be converted to show their body on television and claim your village or a military support point.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand what do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">When these people were not easy to disappeared, but nourished to radiate radically.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region, which is located in a large part of the Arab Ahwazi-community living in Iran, was badly broken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it the native Arab population hard to make their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy was assumed to finish the ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran forthcoming oil and gas fields as well as some of the structures and valuable areas for the Irish agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Since the officials and institutions are not Arabic working forces, the local Arabic Ahwazi will take advantage of access to business opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the glorious Regimes, which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to forcing them to earn their lifetime outside of their homeland.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the position that was published by Ayomide lasi, and originally published on the Aroféminas website. the article was subject of several discussions, where many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in comments using the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am no feminist, react many women - especially white women that are characterised themselves as intersectional Feminist - with froust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wondering why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should be all Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women are still more money despite the same education even less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observations if it comes to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards will always ensure that women before or later deployed in various fields of life to a glassy blanket, and discrimination based upon the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced and I passionite twice and triple underneath them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And nonetheless, when I feel to talk about skin and discrimination on black women from the Diaspora; if I awakened to black women in the LGBTIQ community and discrimination, as well as many white feminists and white intersectional Feminist movement.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But still all of them that women - all women to come together to raise "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to sing the equation (one) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to speak about sexual violence a institutional shape of an institutional form rassistically motiviated power, which we have chosen black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or more that black women and women of other ethics and women have less earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with migrant backgrounds are proven as a white girl as a white girl, due to offend integration.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black sphbears and women with migrant workers were subjected to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership with white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">I wish that all men are all men, all men and all men all men have any of the same right hand. on the other hand, I do not refuse me as a black woman, whose name is refused to be refuge in their thinking about the skin as well as the skin in one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will not fight my hope in a white-feminist Sphugely fight, afflicted me and countless other black women and always rejected again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Soyourner beforehand 1851 in their address: "I am for no woman?" and also I refuse me to make a ideology, in which the black woman in a historical beware and marginalistic beings.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse me to connect me to the group of our Sitten and rooted in order to connect her egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to try white women the importance of the incision of skin and gender. for some of them will continue to dense the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to make it a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was founded in order to give women with different hereminism, and from the white feminism, is still the Word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I love it before, to release me and completely from the feminism and me of the movement of the Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status, that it's so hard-feminist paradigma, that intersectionality is celebrated as a recent phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own performances and will be created for us by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, which gives the author of the book of Africa (about: Africa-Womanism): how we can defend ourselves to our own kind. and not only that in which the cultural, spiritual, physical, physical and even the spiritution elements can make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional Feminist are immediately available separately, when they have read these lines, please inform about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, which is affected by black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womenist environment, I can raise black women and women with other cultures, as I have existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised due to my dark skin, and as part of my existence as part of this paradigmas.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman can boast in a environment where my life is neither overreturn, nor proclaimed to be denied.</seg>

<seg id="2489">Intraocular and Statistics 2 invisible Miserections and a legal system that can not undergone 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to restore, as many women really miserect, says Myrian González. "there are different information and reports, but does not show any information on women's specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains it.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarmice.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Miserections and a legal system that has nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez is a fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, that they knew him the names of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she did not want it, but then, but then, she should always regret for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana was 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but two years in succession for psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the same recognition:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would be sacrifice of Miserection.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I read about it, I thought that only women happens to the worthy of men, because they can open from some-day men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never pass away.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the Miserection by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without names, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they had cut its Beleidigations and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told them as he had isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people said to their contributions, among them also Carlos himself. he asked Athetorisch, whether he ever made his hand against them, and refused to meet his behaviour also a form of miserology.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen as long as lying by Carlos and he didn't left him.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It's almost so as they wanted to say that victims of Miserections were at least a certain Mitfault.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which comes not from Paraguay, struggled almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partners were mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo creo ("I believe you") that are made of women in any way victims of Miserections.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak with others over their experiences to listen to one another.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do that many other do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoriaz, everything began with psychic mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2521">In fact, her wealthy partner managed to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads placed at the authorities, without result and also from their relatives, it received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against their former partners, who developed to a opaque legal fight between Paraguay and their home country, mainly by money, power and influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very well, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of Miserections is a way full of resistors and a fight against corruption in the justice, says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at paraguayan Parliament, under the hashtag # Porellas (# Fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-influence) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original study looks like to explain Femizid to a standalone Criminal Court as well as harder to the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia in Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislative text was changed in some points to win the deputies for the law, that the way for the discriminalisation of Abtenders will be prohibited to be punished in Paraguay and can be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was foreseen to carry out the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process, which has to bear the victims of violence even if they would have to receive a secure accommodation, to maintain the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echappri arguments that the law is not effective, if the legislator has no adequate financial funds for the disposal:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreamation is seen as a part in human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place that violence has not been viewed more than anything Norries.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever discovered the facts about this, does not guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetratory.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must not need so long as a normal time, until Miserection is not considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016 the Law was adopted at the paraguayan Senate. previously parts of the law has been changed, among others a passage knowing that partner in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the amendments go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for Aggressor, its victim to attack its victim.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the matches of the words "sex" "" political power "and" sexual harassment "made of parts of the law, however, is considered a great retreat.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his conception</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that is one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Two reasons: for the required medical research, there are two reasons: for a missing on the global health care of many medications and vaccines that cover the special medical needs to the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more gradient effects as elsewhere, and missing investment for research of these diseases by pharmaceutical company is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research, which is carried out by African scientists, in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for research disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS Epidemic effect on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself decided to go on HIV virus before he decided to go home to the samic health care system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With global Voices, Dr. Warrier was discuss about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(dissemination: Dr. Warrier speaks as private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research projects?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjite Warrier RW: at the moment of my work on the application of research results. the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) is subject to laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion according to the important current Scientific assistant in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How to distinguish them in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research research. we set just appreciated solutions that have been different differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will remain the receiver instead of his makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we receive, are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where comes the financing and support?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find an appropriate scientist for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: in the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects will be funded by different.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's difficult to find people who will return or here, because the financing and development ancies are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work before you don't work before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure complies with the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous power supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of public opinion of Science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should focus on focus, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have great students all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are necessary to special scientific training starting at every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social science, Computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transmitted diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine are very benefited.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can us describe the pros and disadvantages of life than scientist in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do, and the perfect access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be accessable to pay (the so-called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">Global food production produced from USA to India: like "Open Source"</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally reported on the Ensia.com, a magazine that talked about solvents for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred since the 1980s in the US lettuce.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company provides 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant, which was built by NASA astronauts in the space of space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In almost 20 years, Mortons abandoned work only by his own imports and the question, how many salads have been given, borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he saw that more salads were patented, and that he could not use it because of him.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases, a special Rot- or Green or Green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years always more plants have been registered in more plants like cereal or cartons. due to this trends ensure plant breeding, environmental schematics and experts for nutritional safety around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representatives of a millennia-old tradition bred Morton still lettuce, he needs longer, because his work is still weakened with more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I lie in a river a rocky brood. I have to blunt it in a river.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So, we have to make this now, but it's a break with the breeding. "says he." I think that this patents on Salad to go far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if it stand before the court, no more will be patented by a new salads, because all features were already patented, so good as possible and attempted to try to those features.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very sensitive and paint to use any material that is being protected by a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined the world in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breed).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Römersalat the variety of Outreddish in the "Greenhouse" of the station, and eaten it. there will be tested if plants are cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's not a random that this name is rather so sounds, when the movement originate from the IT-area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" -Saatgut) is inspired by the motion for free "Open Source" software, the alternatives to be available protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched into life to ensure that some plant species and genic are not being protected by spiritual property and so for plants.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, OSSI, US breeder can also undertake that other of them brewed seeds from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This means, however, did not allow you to continue business and to buy them. "open Source" -breeder can only buy them to cross your seed, and it is not available immediately - two aspects, which are prohibited by many vegetable patents respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Since its launch in 2014, the dozens of breeder and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Düstere prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritiated Professor of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the Saaty and the possibility to eat new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Saatwell plays an role in bigger than Biodiversity, rights of farmers, rights of farmers and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use or only little to use, by clicking Saaty with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg betont that the "Open Source" Movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture, or do not hesitate to develop our goal of ecological sustainability. "" "" "" "", "he will also know that this species is bred, how this vegetables is bred, threatened how this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritives without loss soverability is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative was obliged to make other their seed continues. in contrast to this, Saatery and plant features are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters arguments that the future of food supply is endangered because it is available separately due to the abundant mental property rights on plants, which is always restricted, unprecedging.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of the OSSI, focused in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it was found that approximately one third of all cartridges are being protected by spiritual ownership, so that it is not usable for plants either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby could not be planted as wheat in even larger style as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they can prove their taste or their color, through which their taste or their color improved to such, due to those in certain environments, and threatened such as garbage or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties are indicated that the available plant material for breeders is currently more patents. genetic variety, but there is necessary as ever before, as the modified conditions are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman is important important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four enjoys and co-operation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of the United States, the company for preservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it speaks of the view that the other breeders including other breeder equipment, as "patents and the protection of plant varietened innovations." a patent is taken in the Grunde that everyone can be completed as soon as patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection of such protection is not, but it promotes it to be provided by the public more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, certainly not a innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have been waiting for so long to wait for plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, but genetic resources always have been able to be a general practitious. neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monodicts are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitated their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's, what is about us, and it will not be impossible to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">A total of dysed Morton on the concept of itself, plant features to patented: "we created the characteristics not really self.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them out of and as breeder, we ultimately do not see how the plants are that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature ".</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and OSSI Executive Board, there is another important aspect of the plant: "who are bred to keep his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large courts and monocultures believes, for its cultivation, herbizide are needed, farmed in his sorts of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly in gentleman. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, make it possible to survive the most smaller Saatgutters, even without Patents and keep it for too expensive and therefore not worth it, or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent implant Frank Morton looks for his breeding garden Salad.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders caused by the destruction of vegetable patents: "it looks like that I produce my efforts to produce new products, patented as company.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to use a new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competent have been sell for some years in a few years, "says it." with a patent is being protected for 20 years before the competition. "global resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Indeed, the US appeared in the "Open Source" to be leading the concept, but the concept will spread over all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Development"), which is characterized as professional organisation in the field of resources, which works in the centre with farmers together and helps them to meet them, new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" "" "" "" "in order to sell your own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol works on an "open-source" licence, which ultimately an formellent and legal form of the OSSI obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(provisions for the fares differ from country to land, why because of the OSSI obligation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken over.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Commission declared that conventional farms should not be patented for the present practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is yet no law; now it is to attempting to governments the governments of the Member States to make this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos attempts to be an conference on "Open Source" -saatgutters and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies to learn something about the "Open Source" -Saatgutters and the global trend to use Saatgut.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for the "Open Source" - Saatgutsystems that the organization currently is currently a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" -Saatgutsystems for the scheduled next year of official start-up.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental and development forces (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on conqusion, Technology and Concentration) has to publish a database of seed and Biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a Saatgut Map</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the future of essens - a prohibition of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published that the opportunity to come to Saata, to make it a stable supply with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems betont - a connection, by the Luby of OSSI we hope to recognize him more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the motion for regional and ecological food has played especially on it, where and as something was played, and Saatgutsystems have almost a role played, so Luby." we are now try to meet men that even more behind their foodstuffs. "</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara dominated party Hezb-e-Wahdat was murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt suddenly protection.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The well known for their hatred on the Hazara known Taliban arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape Asharaf found in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A few years long worked in a cohabrub. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took it, and went into Iran, and went into Iran again. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing bags with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the Afghan refugees was influenced by Elend and exploitation in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remember Asharaf in an interview with global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in a building site at the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we suspended nylon in front of the open windows that we will not be glad. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made it for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous trip to the sea, he suffered and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf obdachlos, ran only by the streets of Rome, ran in parks and went to a church where eating twice a day food intake.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high irrigation quotas a type of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is similarly to find asylum seekers in the country, catasters.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers under a general deficiency of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special atmosphere centers in the hands of the hands of unqualified and invented staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to asylum, if it is officially placed an application for asylum - which can go down to the registration of asylum monthly.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for a accommodation, either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it also said Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his imbursing life helped Asharaf, coming soon from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf in the construction of an hosting in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened a second hostel with a second Hostel and a snail.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2913">According to official estimations, about 20.000 Afghanistan are living in Italy.</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where a risk is also ways to invest Ashark with a smile." I want to invest in Afghanistan. "</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forget my country, and I can't live happy when I know that my people.</seg>
