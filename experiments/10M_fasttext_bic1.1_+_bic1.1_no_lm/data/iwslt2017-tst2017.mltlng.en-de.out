this is James R@@ isen .
you know him because he won the New York Times rep@@ orter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before a man had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , he wrote R@@ isen a book on which he published the NS@@ A il@@ legal phones of Americ@@ ans .
but it is another chapter that should be a permanent impression .
in ther@@ ein , he describes a cat@@ ast@@ ers of US intelligen@@ ce operation in which the CIA was liter@@ ally sur@@ pris@@ oned for a attri@@ but@@ or by Iran .
if it sounds clear , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know what the chapter did not forget ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government filed against R@@ isen and asked him to call his supp@@ os@@ edly sources .
in this train he became a symbol for the samples of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to be split and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to release secret information .
but it &apos;s impossible to use this right when media will not get information and if they do not protect the identity of the mu@@ d .
so as the government of R@@ isen , did he did something to put what many cour@@ age@@ ing rep@@ orter had already before him : he ref@@ used , and said that he would prefer to pass in prison .
from 2007 to 2015 he lived R@@ isen with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days prior to the trial , a somewhat outer usual .
suddenly though she was lon@@ gl@@ ang , that it would definitely be found to fall in their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the mean@@ time , the rep@@ orter and sources can always be hidden less .
instead of sn@@ akes and rob@@ ots to bring back to the statements , which might also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so , the investig@@ ator , without his conc@@ eption , his phone at home was org@@ as@@ m ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel information with the list of flights .
in the middle of these information , they found them that they used Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and risks attached to the source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama said to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the justice has more con@@ vic@@ ted than all U.S. govern@@ ments before him .
now you can imag@@ ine how to be a problem , especially because the government can be opened too much of their work as a home .
since September 11 , almost every article about national safety the result that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went into a journ@@ alist .
so we set the press work in the game which is protected by the first constitu@@ tional view , because the government has always more possibilities to use any more possibilities .
but as the technology of the government allows the right of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and although they can contact the moment , in which they can contact , instead of them in the testim@@ ony .
today , it &apos;s communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen had written book , and it is much more safe than normal E @-@ ma@@ ils or telephone calls .
such technology is sec@@ ure@@ ly , an open source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous that was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working here .
instead of an e @-@ mail , you walk to an News website , as it is the Washington Post .
there you can download documents or information , as for each ordinary contact form .
these will be encry@@ pted and saved on a server to access only the relevant news agency .
so , the government cannot preser@@ ves more information and many of the information which would like to request , would be no longer available .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a little part of the whole to protect the press release in the 21st century .
unfortunately , in all the world , govern@@ ments are always the new Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies , which are dangerous .
it is to ensure that not only techn@@ ological beli@@ e@@ vers like Edward Snow@@ den has an option to make mis@@ er@@ ates . it is so important that we protect the next w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the more about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers pl@@ ei@@ d knows and of over@@ fill health houses . or the next environmental management , the alarm to re@@ tain water of Flin@@ t . or a pilgri@@ m@@ st in@@ sider that war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only for those who want to cover crimes to protect our constitu@@ tional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest dates back to the history . &#93; &#91; that &#93; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#93; &#91; is &#93; what does this week we have hidden from news on a statement . &#93; this week we have been hidden from news about an L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama en@@ rolling an@@ cho@@ p mos@@ bag Fonseca
the publication of this documents gives a small in@@ sight into the secret world of the control box .
we will get an impression of which customers , banks and law@@ yers to companies such as Mos@@ bags Fonseca , and say : &quot; Ok@@ ay , we need an an@@ on@@ ymous company . you can use it ? &quot;
we really see the e @-@ ma@@ ils , the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is back .
there are also reports that a prohib@@ ition of the brut@@ al dict@@ ators B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ad mail@@ box in star@@ o@@ asen .
it is claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads through a narrow friend of child@@ hood , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now it will be there outside a lot of numerous people and others , the ner@@ v@@ ous will wait for the next release , and on the next unveil@@ ed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an ag@@ encies or a John Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems we@@ aves from you , me , common people .
why should us say that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and cour@@ age@@ ous in the location are to hide and not all their taxes , then this is less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concern@@ ed us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these do@@ ings are ph@@ al@@ om@@ en@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading polit@@ icians , such as secret tax@@ ies of some few were used to hide and bor@@ row@@ ers -- anything , which we have been discussed and unc@@ tions for ten years .
I think many people appears to understand this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax is work .
I always give it as a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ zi@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe for me .
so one company has another company in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand why it is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for criminal off@@ ence and tax authorities , as well as journalists or the civil society really understand what thing is .
I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter .
probably because there was no pro@@ min@@ ent Americ@@ ans , who arrived in these enthusi@@ asts that sc@@ and@@ al came .
now it &apos;s not so that there are no American Americ@@ ans that hi@@ ding your property in tax .
however , through the principle , after that this star@@ o@@ asen , Mos@@ cow@@ lings has f@@ ewer American customers .
we had a data run of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the United States .
in fact , it &apos;s so that you need to obtain less information , less information is necessary to get a company to green than a library ID .
this type of in@@ transpar@@ ency in the USA has allowed the employees of debt dis@@ playing school children .
it has been exten@@ si@@ vely permitted to loc@@ ate especially an@@ or@@ able invest@@ ors .
it is this kind of behavi@@ or who affects us all .
here with global wid@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out how all this in practice .
how does it work ?
so we have a covered Er@@ ler in the offices of 13 shares in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave birth to an African minister , who wanted to bring a home money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , to buy a private jet .
we sho@@ cked that all of up to a law@@ yer of our investig@@ ator proposal made how he might be trans@@ ferr@@ ing his money .
these were all pre@@ historic times . none of this law@@ yers took us as clients who was transferred to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider that this is not as single acc@@ id@@ ents .
it is not going to have an individual law@@ yer that has spread the investig@@ ated propos@@ als .
it doesn &apos;t work for a single peak beam , managed in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it &apos;s why the system works , through the corru@@ ption , tax ref@@ uge , poverty , and inst@@ ability become established .
and to do this , we need to change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behavi@@ or .
this may anything very tr@@ ace , as if we could do nothing ; as if nothing could have changed , as if it is always the rich and cour@@ age@@ ous .
but when the optimum optim@@ ism should I take it to change that .
within the last few years we have seen prec@@ au@@ tions to more transpar@@ ency , which concern@@ s the owner of companies .
the theme found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Camer@@ on at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been listed in Central Reg@@ ist@@ ern on national level , who &apos;s really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US has left behind it .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ations , but this makes not the progress to see that we would like .
we would like to see how this Panama enthusi@@ asts , this huge in@@ sight into the world of the control box , used in the U.S. and globally for more transpar@@ ency .
for us at the Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need usual people who want to see how other people are hidden their true identity behind the spot@@ light .
we need exec@@ u@@ tives in the economy that stand and say : &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ency is not good for the shop . &quot;
we need the leading polit@@ icians who recogni@@ ze the problem and to end this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now need this kind of tax ref@@ uge , corru@@ ption and money wash .
this is the story how I would like almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk room of a red Mac@@ ro@@ et would be .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a Hind@@ hof@@ strasse .
a type in red Mazda stayed and looked up my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city , and just a road@@ trip through the country . afterwards he would go to Fried@@ en@@ sc@@ or@@ ps .
I lu@@ de him at beer . he told me exc@@ ited as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was ti@@ red .
while we paid the bill , I made him the mist@@ ake him : &quot; where do you look for today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even wor@@ se : &quot; I know it not . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I get now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I didn &apos;t know him yet ! he says to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if it is the really plans . I will not dec@@ eived in the trunk room of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
then I heard me : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
night I was in bed , I star@@ ed to the blank@@ et , and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what haven &apos;t I rocks here ?
a su@@ st@@ range sleeps in my living room .
what if he is cra@@ zy ? &quot;
I got a fear , that I was out of the bed , on tit@@ ular tips to the door , and my sleep door closed .
but he was not cra@@ zy .
we are still in contact .
the art works that he had bought from me now in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as the host . it has changed my angle .
perhaps the people were sold in child@@ hood as a stran@@ ger , actually , friends that were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
Men on my air Matt@@ ress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I participated the air mattress .
we make a tim@@ ing , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost P@@ le@@ ite , my members living and the rent is increased .
I drove that there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I believe , cre@@ ativity can create , fear of fun in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new members of Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I &apos;ve got superior to you . our apartment will stay at a Designer Bed and Breakfast . young design@@ ers can stay together , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lu@@ cky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we also .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham and mel@@ amine cover completely different because we made them for our guests .
we touring with them through the whole city . when we fell our last guest , and the door to the castle , star@@ red Brian and I am .
we had just discovered that we can find new friends and pay our rent ?
the things came in rolls .
my former co @-@ resident , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure whether you could find out of a business team .
so , we presented ourselves to the invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to prepare a site , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are gone .
on the internet you can easily invite more wild@@ life people to stay with them .
this is the next big thing ! &quot;
we was waiting that the miss@@ ile would come .
did she do not .
No one who is still quite with Tro@@ st , would inv@@ est in a business which allows you to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all of them that stran@@ ger are dangerous .
if you have an issue , you have used to things that can easily be good . we were able to be able .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we had learned much more than just view and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall plan .
we learned how to build objects , but now we wanted to create a great confidence , between people who never had taken before .
can design such a bit ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I want to give you a KO@@ ST@@ PRO@@ BE , which grade confidence is to be reb@@ elled .
it is a 30 @-@ second experim@@ ent . it is out of your com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
th@@ um@@ bs high if you are ready .
take your cell phone into the hand .
now I would like to like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock mobile phone with your left seats .
this silent flight of pan@@ ic , you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel that the first time to open the door .
because the only , what is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a stran@@ ger ?
most feel the responsibility .
so many guests feel the most guests where they can comfortably sleep .
only for this reason , our company exist .
just so , who has actually all Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you deci@@ de on Twitter that he must support for the President of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
they now experienced , what kind of trust we want to re@@ build this . I would like to tell you some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail to this experim@@ ent ?
what if your desc@@ endants can be presented once again with his name ; if he could have been told how his dog or his children are hot ?
imag@@ ine you , they would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , saying , &quot; It can really be very well maintained . &quot;
how would you feel when you enter your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ based feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people , negative enco@@ unters .
ulti@@ mat@@ ely , we decided to wait till both hosts will be given as a guest as a guest , before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined that people can trust in one another , depending on the age and the residence .
little surprise we trust the people in most , who are on similar to us .
we can find more differences , the dest@@ o less trust .
this is a natural social security engineer .
exciting is to be added if you add the rep@@ utation to a person -- in our case .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , do not change anything .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good rep@@ utation of the community .
so the right design can help us to over@@ come some of our deep mar@@ g@@ hts .
we drove that trust is dependent on how much is from there .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when one tells us , how for example , &quot; Hi ! &quot; , you get no answer .
in much , how for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will also be rather accepted .
so there is an optimal degree for op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I will make it with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design to rest@@ ore this degree ?
we use the size of text to recommend the correct lot of text . we also give tips to which topics can be something else .
our company is based on hope that the correct design can help to over@@ come our prec@@ eding components .
in what we had not expected , the great quantity of people who were more than ready to set these advantages .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recogni@@ ze three things .
first : un@@ believ@@ able good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our teams .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the shop is just fine for us .
of course there are also times if not all is smooth .
there were guests who celebrated the un@@ permitted party or apartments .
host hosts will leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at front front if confidence is broken .
there is nothing wor@@ se than these calls . it &apos;s h@@ urt when I think .
the dis@@ appointment that hear@@ eth in the voice of p@@ ru@@ pt , and is still our greatest mot@@ iv@@ ation to improve us .
fortunately , the 123 million res@@ ett@@ led over@@ nights only a fr@@ action ever .
because people dec@@ eived other to each other .
if confidence is working , W@@ onder@@ fully can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts came to hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travel@@ ers who fig@@ ured to heart inf@@ eri@@ ous activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hosp@@ itals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true gu@@ ardian angel that save lives of a life even though they don &apos;t know not .
you drive one of your own car in the hospital when you die , and waiting for a by@@ pass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel that they don &apos;t feel books .
you can pay a longer stay without any extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , course does not run every stay .
but these rel@@ ations@@ hips behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to reach the Share Economy .
when I asked for the first time over this concept , I asked me :
how does the thought of part with ATM trans@@ action together ?
it is here around a economic trade .
but it is now just &quot; rental industry &quot; to call it , the thing is not just .
Share Economy describes a trade and the human relationship .
people put a part of itself open , and that changes everything .
if you get ready to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but is less authentic .
what would however , if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if on every place where you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a tho@@ roughly and one at a bu@@ pen@@ se tour quarter , of which one has never heard .
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to remove flats from the reason to the Mit@@ ein@@ and@@ ert@@ ation ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities mean the thoughts of the common part ?
I bring my cities before , who permit us and rel@@ ations@@ hips , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and incline .
in South Korean capital , Seoul was already begun . many parking lots that belonged to the government .
now they have been offered . students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead .
were investig@@ ated in hum@@ ans , whose children were under@@ went , In@@ cub@@ ator were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone there are 785 000 people in 191 countries , a stran@@ ger , or even host .
the idea seems to be so cra@@ zy about how it was put to us .
we do not inv@@ ented the wheel in the wheel .
also there was no hospitality also .
there were already similar websites before us .
why does it just work ?
apart from Happ@@ iness and Tim@@ ing we noted that you can find the correct design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to over@@ come down the prec@@ eding components .
I find the ver@@ bl@@ ossom ,
just to over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
I have to think any time in order to pass a red Mazda in me .
we know that design does not solve any problem .
but when it could help us if it had this large effect , I ask myself , what we can use it to use it .
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a beli@@ e@@ vers ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a ter@@ ro@@ rist band ?
or simply a delay on security approach at the airport .
this is true .
I give you not the school for your negative impressions .
so , the media people are so look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the report about Islam and Mus@@ li@@ ms is negative .
studies show : the Americ@@ ans my most would have no Mus@@ li@@ ms .
probably the people did not speak with her U@@ ber trips .
for all those who have never have a must know : it is great , you do not know .
I say you , who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am afraid ,
a se@@ eding @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practice , spiritual mus@@ li@@ min .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sing@@ t , because , baby , I was not so born .
I chose to write me .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ting me .
No , not as hom@@ osexu@@ eller man , as some of my friends , but when Mus@@ li@@ min . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head .
my f@@ emin@@ ist friends stayed here : &quot; why are you re@@ pressed you yourself ? &quot;
the Fun@@ ny was : at that time I was a f@@ emin@@ ist independence of Independence , in contrast to the pressure , which I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and in@@ achiev@@ able beauty .
I did not only pass the faith of my parents .
I have to ger@@ ed with the corru@@ ption .
I read it , thought on , exhibited in question , two and believed .
my relationship to God was not love at the first sight .
she was confidence and s@@ cour@@ age that was de@@ ep@@ ened with every reading of the body .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mic brings me sometimes to W@@ one .
I &apos;m aware of myself . I feel that God knows .
did you ever feel that any man takes you , but some@@ how loves you ?
so it fe@@ els like .
later I married and began , as all the good Egypti@@ ans , my career as engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the grave of the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then there was a terri@@ ble morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember what they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had ed at the end of the morning , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ cking &quot; &quot;
it was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w in buildings , people sp@@ out of buildings .
what was this ?
a accident ?
a technical inter@@ ference ?
my shock , wal@@ ked quickly in Emp@@ loyment .
why should I do something ?
I moved the television channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ s &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it &apos;s not only my country has been att@@ acked , but in N@@ u destroyed me the works of other of a citi@@ zens@@ hip in a nation .
on the same day we had to go through the West West of the USA to pull into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember , as we swe@@ pt at -- as we swe@@ pt out -- so deep it went to my seat in my seat , and I was detected in my seat for the first time .
we went in this night in our apartment in a new town in which there is like a completely different world .
and then , when I heard , and read the war@@ n@@ ings of the national Islamic organisations , which was growing : &quot; be growing , &quot; &quot; Be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ d melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in those week -- the day in Mus@@ li@@ ms to gather there .
and again the warning : &quot; goes not to this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive report of reporting .
the fe@@ el@@ ings were un@@ il@@ uted and I heard of att@@ acked on Mus@@ li@@ ms or of people that he held for Mus@@ li@@ ms , and sm@@ ote for Mus@@ li@@ ms .
there was really fire connection on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really right .
because the people who had att@@ acked this land , our country att@@ acked .
I got the cour@@ age of people on the ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ s .
imag@@ ine me ! I was also w@@ ager .
it is not easy to expl@@ ain in itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the scho@@ ol@@ ations that are hard .
today we can listen to people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Mus@@ li@@ ms .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want Mus@@ li@@ ms and close to Mus@@ li@@ ms .
they talk about the village of Tum@@ or in the body of the United States .
it is only the question : are we sol@@ ved or good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or remov@@ es as a whole and a gut@@ ters tum@@ or stops just under observation .
the altern@@ atives are mean@@ ing@@ less because the question is wrong .
Mus@@ li@@ ms are such as all other Americ@@ ans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a living important organ .
thank you !
Mus@@ li@@ ms are invent@@ or and teachers , initial hel@@ pers and the Olympi@@ on@@ iken .
will the closing of Mos@@ che@@ en America saf@@ er ?
it might be a few parking lots , but not the ter@@ ror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que is to consider some other faith toler@@ ant , and major civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told , people are really not detected in Mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alized in her cell@@ ars or in front of a computer .
it has established that he starts online . as a first , the person who beli@@ eves , even from their family , that the person beli@@ eves , that the person beli@@ eves , that the person beli@@ eves that the ter@@ ro@@ rist@@ s are the true Mus@@ li@@ ms , and everyone who do their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a re@@ iter@@ ate or faith .
if we want to prevent Radi@@ alisation , we need to keep the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still preser@@ ve , Islam is a viol@@ ent religion .
finally , a group as the IS had its bro@@ od @-@ ality with the cor@@ an .
when Mus@@ li@@ min , as a mother when I believe that we must do all to stop a group as the IS .
but we would add us into their approach world when you recogni@@ ze them as a representative of 1.6 billion cred@@ itors .
thank you !
the IS so much with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ K@@ LAN with Christian@@ ity .
both groups can claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you have a look at it , it doesn &apos;t know what they do in their &quot; Holy Script@@ ure . &quot;
it is their bro@@ od @-@ ality that they can read these things into the Script@@ ures .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him because they predic@@ cur@@ tains the IS .
I was really sur@@ pris@@ ed and asked him , whether they have been in contact with radi@@ cal religious driver .
he said , the problem was exactly the contr@@ ary . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , brought them to silence , and told her , their sense of ini@@ qu@@ ity in the world , they would only be in trouble .
nothing inspired by nothing , who would have given their wor@@ thy sense , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ental champ@@ agne , which gave their own solution .
this Im@@ am set the connection to God and their church again .
instead of them for their w@@ age , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for an effective change in the world .
what they learn in the mos@@ que , keep it before the IS .
that was an in@@ sight , like the Islam@@ op@@ position me and my family affects .
but how does it works to normal Americ@@ ans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour con@@ vention from fear every day to our democ@@ racy from our thoughts ?
a study -- actually several recent studies -- show : if we fear us , happen at least three things .
we accept a author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and demonstr@@ ations .
a study shows : if you reports test persons messages presented , in which negative over Mus@@ li@@ ms , they voted more military att@@ acked on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Mus@@ li@@ ms .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at the m@@ ood for Mus@@ li@@ ms to the top , -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times , but never dies in connection with ter@@ ro@@ rist attacks .
it happened in the field of the war period and during two standard periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ position is not just the natural response to Muslim ter@@ ror , as I expect it .
it can actually be a tool for man@@ ip@@ ulation of the public to expl@@ ain the found@@ ations of a free company , which has s@@ ensi@@ ble and well inform@@ ational citizens .
de@@ aling with Mus@@ li@@ ms is an early warning sign .
we feel perhaps as the first but the tox@@ ic air of fear of an@@ xi@@ ety us .
during the assignment of collective school , it is not only about to dec@@ ei@@ ve itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both come to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , tal@@ ented , promising ...
his sister would say that he was the sweet , and the gig@@ antic man had been called .
she attended him there , and he showed his life imprisonment . she was blo@@ oming , saying ,
&quot; when is from my brothers , become a sealed young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne for her brother and his wife , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been mur@@ dered in her apartment , as in one direction , after he was posted to Mus@@ li@@ ms on his Facebook page .
he f@@ oss eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ al , but also f@@ atal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we went to the mos@@ que or remained at home ?
we prac@@ tise it and for us there was no light decision , for it was going to pass through our children : one that would check us through fear through fear , or that we can try our religion for our religion .
we chose to the mos@@ que .
with our son in the kind@@ ergarten we left flo@@ ur@@ ly , with high pressure for the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went my shoes , went into prayer , and what I looked , made me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am was a pro@@ cl@@ am@@ ation , and called our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ h@@ ist , ath@@ ei@@ sts , beli@@ e@@ vers and non @-@ beli@@ e@@ vers who came to attack us , but to stand us .
in this moment I &apos;m coll@@ aps@@ ed .
these people were there because they were M@@ ut , and co @-@ feel of pan@@ ic and anter@@ ior chamber .
what will you choose ?
what will you select at the moment of fear and the Fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you be on number safe ?
or will you know where my : we are better than the .
thank you many thanks .
thank you nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you se@@ emed to have a ner@@ vo@@ id .
but I ask me what do you say that you can claim a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a monument with drau@@ ght are working in a no@@ ble mon@@ uments , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to people ?
DA@@ LIA Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , let you feel not . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually how it is allowed .
if you look at the Mus@@ li@@ ms on the whole world , and I opened the biggest one of the people with the world , want people normal things .
they want to relax for the family , they want to live and they want to live in peace .
so I am not a exception .
if people appear as an exception , then it is usually broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . DA@@ LIA Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what as a platform for Bast@@ ers started shortly before , a milli@@ ard@@ en@@ eries .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional drug . made in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ packages in our social sci@@ ousness , has an autonom@@ ous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France , a six metre high tower from 1 500 bri@@ cks were built . some years ago they began to fly with ro@@ pes .
multiple devices achieve high speed and acceleration across the smallest space .
you can also build independent structures .
they have learned to carry loads with tur@@ bul@@ ences , to re@@ act with tur@@ bul@@ ences and re@@ act .
today we wish to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the b@@ orders of the mower in autonom@@ ous flight .
in order to know a system aut@@ on@@ om , it has to know the collective damage to know where the mobile objects are in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we have no external cameras to focus objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s dem@@ os , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laborat@@ ories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
external command exists to the highest eb@@ de@@ . e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; l@@ anden . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
one flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ ack@@ le , it is efficient in the return flight efficient , much more efficient than hel@@ icopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most powerful wh@@ is@@ ers , it can be silent , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of tail@@ f@@ ails is that they re@@ act to tur@@ bul@@ ences like wind b@@ ids .
we develop new controllers and alg@@ orith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind is that the flight unit does not run the optimal position in which the optimal position can be improved .
Ok@@ ay .
during our research , we often provide basic attention to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icop@@ ters are known for about machines with a thousand moving parts , which are merg@@ ed to viol@@ ate .
before decades the pil@@ ots could fly the pil@@ ots , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ ellers and a tail@@ ru@@ der .
un@@ longest , we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical eas@@ i@@ est operated flight unit . it was found in front of short .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
No folding , hing@@ es and trans@@ vers@@ al , no further actuators or controls , only one prop@@ ellers .
although it is mechan@@ ically sim@@ p@@ el , happens in the inner life , that it can fly very stable , and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t know about the elegant alg@@ or@@ it@@ hm of the tail@@ piece . to bring it to f@@ ool you must throw it exactly right .
the prob@@ ability to design it exactly right now , if I am all of it is small , I will be fil@@ med a video that is fil@@ med yesterday .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ ace is a exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ ver , this machine is here with eight prop@@ ellers , exercise in over@@ flow .
what do you do with all this flow ?
they see that he is balanced balanced .
therefore he is ambi@@ val@@ ent in his alignment .
thus he receives the final capability ,
in the space to move in all directions , no matter what the direction of he is turned or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
one time is adjustable in models , the rest will be rede@@ em directly when the flies .
let us see it .
if flying machines will be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely saf@@ ely and saf@@ ely .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ propeller drive machines .
these rot@@ ates clock@@ wise in clock@@ wise
and the others against the clock@@ wise .
when you build it , how a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a little bit , a motor or prop@@ ellers falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can also be flying the machine if even restricted .
we will demonstr@@ ate it , making half a half gate .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic s@@ akes .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , co@@ ordin@@ ated units enables a pallet on aest@@ hetic expression .
we took the usual Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and rats them with loc@@ ali@@ zing technology and alg@@ orith@@ ms .
each unit white , where it is in room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
ho@@ pe@@ fully mot@@ iv@@ ely mot@@ iv@@ ate these demonstr@@ ations , the new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine that you want to get a flying lamp l@@ amp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it &apos;s difficult to forecasts the influence of this technology .
for types such as we find the w@@ ages in the development and the Schaff@@ ens@@ act .
it serves as a memory , as wonderful and mag@@ ical our universe is , and that it is cre@@ ativity to form them to form a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology sol@@ ves massive and economical potential is the door on the i .
thank you many thanks .
about 1.3 billion years ago in a very far away galax@@ y , two black holes are always faster , you emig@@ rated to the mass of three s@@ uns on a tenth month in pure energy .
this short moment , she sh@@ aw@@ less than all stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire hotel .
it was a very great bu@@ all .
they were not able to set your energy in the form of light --
we eventually speak of black soldering holes .
the entire energy has been given into the room @-@ TIME @-@ GE@@ GU@@ GE itself and the Uni@@ verse explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ality .
we start the events at first time .
in front of 1.3 billion years ago , several hundred life was produced on the earth .
since then the earth has brought forth : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ c@@ ans , hum@@ ans and -- God understand us at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group is particularly Mu@@ enster -- R@@ ai White from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to seek after gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft .
most of those kept them for cra@@ zy .
but enough people knew it as ver@@ ified gen@@ ies that the U.S. National Science Foundation will finance her idea .
after decades of decades , design , conc@@ eption and extremely much har@@ ter work , they built the Detector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ Ob@@ serv@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of LI@@ GO could be considerably improved , which improved its recognition .
therefore we called Advanced LI@@ GO at Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started for a recent test run to cl@@ ari@@ fy some minor flaws .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissi@@ oning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation wave of the two colored black holes caused by the earth through the ground .
they went through and me
and also through the detector .
scott Hug@@ hes : only two mom@@ ents in my life were em@@ oti@@ onal than that :
the Birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ew@@ ell of my to@@ d@@ si@@ ken Father .
in the grave they were the fruits of my life .
all that which I worked for I had no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on the MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft such as LI@@ GO meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a balanced in the GE@@ OT of space and time .
during the previous wave , the space , and its total content will be stret@@ ched into a direction and stret@@ ched into the other .
to illustr@@ ate Do@@ z@@ ard , in Kurs@@ k to the Rel@@ ative act is often a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance on .
&quot; stret@@ ching and sli@@ ce , stret@@ ching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is extremely weak , even sm@@ ile .
on September 14 , for example , everyone stret@@ ched from us at the meeting of waves and stret@@ ched . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this is called 20 N@@ ul@@ len according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 , I declared the LI@@ GO staff for cra@@ zy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , which is already ab@@ sur@@ d , and it &apos;s already ab@@ sur@@ d , the length is measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a atom@@ ic core . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on gra@@ v@@ itation
abras@@ ion Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of the LI@@ GO@@ s , the h@@ unt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties when the construction of such det@@ ectors are mighty .
but physi@@ c@@ ist are in@@ vention and with the support of the public , all o@@ bst@@ acles are over@@ thro@@ wn . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before its success .
Back to LI@@ GO . scott claims that LI@@ GO is more an ear than a eye .
I want to expl@@ ain what that means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things for us : visual exc@@ erp@@ ts , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite convenient . for such as you can use a picture or card of your d@@ ye@@ ing by several points by using several points .
at tones is the different .
audi@@ ences have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of D@@ ingen that is particularly much mean :
the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties like clay and height , rhyth@@ m and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just Alice &quot; now .
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ummer Bob &quot; .
the same is considered to gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft .
we can &apos;t use any simple pictures of objects in all .
but we are looking forward to Am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for LI@@ GO meet the measured frequencies in the headphones range .
if we convert wave pattern in bar@@ n , we can listen to the All booking .
the gra@@ v@@ itation to lau@@ gh , can hide themselves about much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where@@ with my colle@@ ague Scott already employed .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , about it easy : w@@ up@@ p !
rotate the two bodies very quickly , hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional clay change . it sounds like : WU @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion transformer , inserted in the shaft form .
AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date , at least I never forget to hear , when at least I have never forget , recogni@@ ze this as noise of -- SH : ... two black soldering holes with 30 @-@ fold solar weight , which makes about as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let us over@@ lay ourselves that means .
two black holes , the sealing body in All , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , one hundred times per second before they are col@@ li@@ de .
imag@@ ine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
it is the lead @-@ meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a reas@@ onable new way to expl@@ oring the universe , as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the All lau@@ tern and the inv@@ isible .
many in all , we can see -- prac@@ tically or bas@@ ically -- not .
a sup@@ ern@@ ova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in Sup@@ ern@@ ov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned about the All .
but the exciting physical processes happen but in the core , which is hidden behind thousands kilometres of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never see that they are op@@ aque because these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational sh@@ ines of iron , when it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ kn@@ all : I would have search@@ ing the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see , because of the ur@@ ged by his own dis@@ aster .
using Gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft , it should be possible to draw up until the beginning .
and the most important : I &apos;m optimi@@ stic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see , and of which we don &apos;t have any presentation . things that we &apos;re only going to hear .
in fact LI@@ GO occurred in the first start of things which we had not expect .
my colle@@ ague on the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project says to this topic : me : the type of stars that were observed , such as LI@@ GO they are observed , the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so@@ lic@@ able on our arch@@ e@@ ological work for our arch@@ e@@ ological work .
LI@@ GO enables us a completely viewing to the events in all , on the birth of the stars and ulti@@ mat@@ ely , as we went out of this ch@@ aos .
AA : the challenge now exists since then to be possible as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build large det@@ ectors and the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ories on Earth and in All .
for what could beautiful be more than the ur@@ ged yourself ?
now is the time great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
before some time I tried a experim@@ ent .
one year long would I say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; say , before I was afraid .
No matter if it was afraid , me in un@@ pleasant situ@@ ations , I forced to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I wanted to speak to the public ?
No , but yes !
would I wanted live in television ?
No , but yes !
do I wanted to start with the Schau@@ play ?
No , no , no , but yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes
and a re@@ turning thing : exactly that I was afraid , w@@ ov@@ or I fe@@ ared me .
my an@@ xi@@ ety to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; Yes &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; Yes &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life , on an un@@ expect@@ edly art . it began with a question of my small .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and Em@@ erson , The Sm@@ all@@ est , calls from un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
when she was a wa@@ it@@ iner@@ ary from the south .
&quot; estimates , I need milk for my sn@@ ail . &quot;
she asked me , if I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars me to play with them . No matter what I just do , or wh@@ it@@ her , I say always Yes -- every one time .
almost . I am not perfect but I felt very much .
it has a mag@@ ical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a blo@@ oming side effect : just before short , I was actually , that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ ages to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things I have chosen to life .
dream job .
No .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I canc@@ el television . I re@@ produc@@ tive television .
I have been doing television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for this , 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours TV . three up to four shows are at the same time .
every ship@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that were not exist .
the budget for an epis@@ ode of a television calendar can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new epis@@ ode every nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three ship@@ ments : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 epis@@ odes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
my TV series are running on Thursday at the Thursday evening in America .
around the world you run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million people .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments , which I used himself , and not only produced , so even above . I must find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans and my stories .
four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fire that are around the world .
do you know who still makes ?
No , I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ plement it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; Author &quot; falls .
I say to you , that all of you are so hard , if I have a company , a country or a class@@ room , that I don &apos;t know that I say : I understand that I say , I understand that there is not a dream of dream .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no te@@ ars .
I have much , hard and I love it .
if I am ti@@ ed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country from the kid@@ ney .
it is , when I set up troops , than pic@@ kl@@ ed I on a screen .
as a dre@@ fe one high sound , he depth a marathon .
it fe@@ els like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it .
it is cre@@ atively , mechan@@ ically , stri@@ ct and resi@@ sting , fun@@ ny and inter@@ ference , gr@@ ati@@ cally and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and s@@ ensi@@ ble , and the best of it is .
there is so a change in me when the work is good .
a s@@ ums begins in my head , and it grows in my head , and it grows like a revi@@ val road , I could always go for you .
many people take place when I ex@@ plan@@ ed them that I will say unto them that I have prepared my write to me .
do not understand me wrong , that do it .
but the Sum@@ men -- as I started working with the TV production when I started to work and to do , to create and dis@@ assembl@@ ing , discovered this matter , this s@@ ums , these energy .
the sum@@ ming is more than the writing .
the Sum@@ men is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a drug .
the Sum@@ men is music . the s@@ ums is light and air .
the sum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have s@@ ums as a s@@ ums , you &apos;re not different than to the size .
the feeling , not different to stre@@ ches , than according to size , no matter what price .
this is called the s@@ ums .
or maybe it means a work@@ g@@ olic .
maybe it is true .
perhaps it is it to go .
perhaps it is the an@@ xi@@ ety times .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know that I made not for the fail@@ ure , and I know that I love the Sum@@ men .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask in question .
in order to make a clear : each suc@@ ces@@ ful I will report , each more epis@@ odes , the more details , the more information , the more things that I have been more than I am history , more than I am history , so much more expectations .
ever I have been working to work successfully , the dest@@ o more must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t true ?
the country that I create a marathon , the army , which I run the army , the screen , the high sound , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men .
I like this s@@ ums . I love the Sum@@ men .
I need the Sum@@ men . I am the sum@@ ming .
am I only this Sum@@ men ?
and then he stops the sum@@ ming .
revised , over@@ load , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ ming stop .
now my three daughters to acc@@ ustom@@ ed the truth that their M@@ ama is one single workers .
Har@@ per tells men : &quot; my M@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Em@@ erson says : &quot; estimates , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are baby titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the Sum@@ men had heard .
the s@@ emen of the engine umm@@ ers .
I love my work no longer . the engine was .
the sum@@ ming went back .
my s@@ ums was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 @-@ hours @-@ days , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ates , a Titanium sleeps , is not available , with all your hearts , clear eyes , what@@ ever .
but there was no s@@ ums .
silence was silent in me .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything that I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men was I .
what do you know what you do , the work that loves you , suddenly connected ?
I know about some of you : &quot; Heu@@ l you out of , bl@@ ossom the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know it , you will do , one teacher to be a teacher , a mother called to be a teacher , a mother called to be a mother , and knows how to know the sum@@ ming , and knows how to stop the s@@ ums , if the sum@@ ming stops away , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when I hear the song of my heart , I can survi@@ ve the silence ?
and then , my &quot; Süd@@ states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; is a question .
I am on the way back outside , late dr@@ an and she says , &quot; M@@ ama , do you play ? &quot;
and I want to say , when I will see two things :
first , I have to say Yes to all , and second , they knew me not . &quot;
they called no more &quot; estimates . &quot;
when is it ?
I miss it when I am Titan bin and my s@@ ums up , and here it changes all of my own eyes .
and so said they : &quot; M@@ ama , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; Yes &quot; .
it is nothing special .
we play and her si@@ sters , we laugh@@ ing much and I tast@@ y very dram@@ ati@@ cally from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s ed@@ ingly , because my pain and my pan@@ ic in the lon@@ el@@ iness , and in abs@@ ence of the Sum@@ mens , I can do nothing to fit .
I am fo@@ amed .
I am silent .
the country that I create a marathon , the marathon , the army , the army that are high sound - they often have no more .
everything that exists for stick@@ y fing@@ ers and mo@@ ist , delic@@ ate voices , watch cra@@ y@@ ons and the song , in which it is going to leave the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and sim@@ p@@ licity .
the air on this place is so almost that I can hardly at@@ he .
I can hardly believe that I ate .
playing the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something is dissol@@ ves in me .
a mental door goes on and an energy feed comes up .
and that didn &apos;t know , but it happens .
I feel it .
the s@@ ums are slowly back .
No full volume , hardly because it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the s@@ ums but a s@@ ums .
and now I feel to know a mag@@ ical mystery .
but let us stay at the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
No magic . No secret . only love .
it is something that we have g@@ otten .
the sum@@ ming , the emplo@@ y , which is titanium ens@@ um@@ men , that is only the subst@@ itute .
if I ask you , if I say to you , who I am I write with the help of ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I am forget what the real Sum@@ men is .
the s@@ ums is no strength and it is not working .
it is dependent of joy .
the real s@@ ums is dependent on love .
the sum@@ ming is electricity , which comes from the life of life .
the real Sum@@ men is Self @-@ con@@ sci@@ ousness and peace .
the real s@@ ums are ig@@ no@@ bled the pressure of the history that can be used to er@@ asing tasks that expect@@ ation and pressure .
the genuine Sum@@ men is simple and original .
the real Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps the promised God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan bin ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child will play with me I will say Yes .
I have been doing this , so that I can open me as a work@@ force of any debt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other option , if I want to hear the s@@ ums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not well in playing , I like it .
play it not yet to play as such as work .
the truth does h@@ urt ,
but I like to play it .
I have been working here , for I love it .
I am better on the workplace than da@@ heim .
this one is pain@@ ful , for what a man works better than to be home ?
well , I , I .
sometimes I hon@@ est me &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am relax@@ ed , is one of them .
we have around the garden around , before and back , go and back .
we make small dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we cut tea bu@@ b@@ bles .
I felt mainly st@@ ei@@ f , ab@@ dom@@ inal and conf@@ ection@@ ery .
I always pre@@ mature after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children will show me how to lives , and the Sum@@ men of the universe met me .
I &apos;m playing and play , until I ask me : why we have heard the games of playing ?
you can also say it ! tell you Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
perhaps you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day .
because you have right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can be less interesting to think when you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones would like to play 15 minutes with me to do so that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but only 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , some of the Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks .
and speak my teen@@ ie daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , it is not required .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on each piece , even on a bad @-@ loader day !
15 minutes on a piece !
No cell phone , no linen , not included .
the day is short : dinner , the children are finished .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my wel@@ fare , my world . it must not be the children . it is not the children to feel the s@@ ums to have a place for his sail@@ ings .
it is not able to play with your own children . it is about joy ,
around the &quot; playing &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes away !
find out what you do .
find out it and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect . I &apos;m sure and I wins . friends , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I was given that I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to make myself more and more .
15 minutes on each , why not walk for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the Sum@@ men came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ ming seems to return when I work not work .
work not work without playing .
it needs time , but after a few months open a door , the energy stre@@ ams , and I find me in my office . I hear me to new ideas . I use it out his way . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the s@@ ums but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the sum@@ ming , the Sum@@ men is not I ... no longer .
bu@@ b@@ ble and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends .
that is my s@@ ums .
the s@@ ums of life .
the s@@ ums of love .
the s@@ ums of work is part of mine , but only one part . and therefore I am so d@@ ank@@ able .
it is me , that I &apos;m a Titan am . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and still I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my inventory is still working .
for more I games , the more happy I have and my children .
for more I games , the more feel better than good mot@@ h@@ ers .
the more I play , the dest@@ iny is my head .
for more I games , the better I work .
for more I games , the greater I will hear the Sum@@ men . the land which I create the marathon , which I run , the troops , the v@@ eil , the sum@@ ming , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the others , the real Sum@@ men : the Sum@@ men of life .
ever I feel this Sum@@ men , the dest@@ o more makes this unusual , b@@ aked , n@@ aked and new life experience in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
for more I am exactly this Sum@@ men , the dest@@ o more know , who I am .
I am author . I think things I have chosen to life .
it belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this Jobs ,
because a dream job should be a little toler@@ ant .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; too less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gin .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how to change your life from a second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after an automobile accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , un@@ like to other bod@@ ily , a very low sk@@ ill for self @-@ he@@ aling .
after a serious inj@@ ury of the central ner@@ v@@ ous system , the patients often have a permanent dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I functional Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gin has been developed .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgery ?
a doctor , trying to improve ner@@ ve functions by various surgical measures .
certainly from one of the most well known , the &quot; Tief@@ en@@ ir@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; are im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the switching circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it &apos;s really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which lit@@ ters under heavy pain@@ ters and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro he@@ aling .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
my opinion , we appro@@ aches us this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
a little help can help the brain itself .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was introduc@@ tory Ober@@ är@@ tin and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often tested patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imag@@ ine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is we@@ ak@@ ened and indicates the sk@@ ull pressure .
to save the life , you must decrease the sk@@ irt pressure .
for this way you have to remove a part of the she@@ pherd balance .
instead of the sw@@ ollen she@@ pherd balance , we decided to analy@@ ze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues who analy@@ ze Hir@@ n@@ mass .
what I do so ?
we wanted cells to grow out of this tissue .
this is no light task .
cells of a tissue growth is comparable with all young children who can be taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to leave it .
exactly that we had to make this cells .
after many att@@ emp@@ ts it was Jean @-@ François .
this is he regard@@ ed under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it was just like a Chief cell culture . with great green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know not know from the organic lessons that the cells are in@@ mature cells that can walk in any cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has grown cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is sur@@ prising to get this kind of tri@@ cells from the surface tissue of the she@@ pherd balance in the OP .
we had a further fas@@ cin@@ ating observation : normal cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells should be different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks died .
so we saw a new , st@@ range cell population , which looked like in the cells , but looked differ@@ ently .
we needed long to understand how he came .
they are from this cells .
this blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral c@@ aves off .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the Fö@@ tus she provide the feeding of the brain .
but why did they maintain us ?
we do not know .
we believe that they have been participating in the he@@ aling of the brain , since we find them in higher concentr@@ ations near the brain .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- from this cells , we received our original cells .
we stand from a pot@@ ential cell source that allows the brain he@@ aling .
it had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experim@@ ent to develop a experim@@ ent .
we wanted a piece of brain in the non @-@ speaking region and then rin@@ se the cells exactly as well as Jean @-@ François did
and then to mark the colors to track them in the brain .
in the last step re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated them at the des@@ er@@ able des@@ er@@ able des@@ er@@ ate .
we call the autonom@@ ous tran@@ splant@@ ation -- author tran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we happen this cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re@@ im@@ ate the same cells in the brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with mon@@ key .
in the first scen@@ ario , we observed the cells in a healthy brain , and we were taken out after some weeks , they would be taken back home . the room is already occupied it , they will not be used there , so it dis@@ appear .
in the second scen@@ ario we found a viol@@ ation and re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated exactly the same cells and well , the cells continued to attack ne@@ ur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show they are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro in the culture .
here we could not be heard of course .
help these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a h@@ enc@@ ement ?
so , we do no mon@@ key with a manual sk@@ ill .
they had to take feed wood from a tray .
that they did very good .
when she achieved a stable sk@@ ill level , we had reached the mot@@ orized in mot@@ orized in mot@@ orized .
then the monkeys were male , they could not move their hand .
just like it would happen , it would recover spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a washed degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are m@@ owing and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechan@@ is@@ ms . they recover up to a certain degree , just as the monkeys .
when we were sure that the Monkey had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recreation , im@@ pl@@ ically we had its own cells .
on the left side you see the monkeys that recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before inj@@ ury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
see , when we re@@ im@@ plant@@ ated the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after the rich plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze and later .
we can use them in other newer versions , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still always to imp@@ ose them with hum@@ ans .
I hope really , that I can show you soon as the human brain has to he@@ al yourself to he@@ al yourself .
thank you many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely at any case .
of course , the question what is the greatest o@@ bst@@ acles before you can start clinical studies in human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest o@@ bst@@ acles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to ass@@ ess about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these types of studies .
BG : that is of course , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of pati@@ ence and an almost professional team .
BG : look in the future -- you have completed research and dis@@ missed the permission to look at the future of clinical trials . if you are going to come into the future , as many years it will take to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
initially it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it be the authority to start it soon ?
then we have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it &apos;s already a long time to choose the treatments to evalu@@ ate treatments and evalu@@ ate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , one needs to apply to a multi @-@ central study .
you must first really refer to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting us and tells us that you have told us .
BG : many thanks .
Democ@@ racy .
we see in the West make a big mist@@ ake to consider of course .
we see the democ@@ racy not considered the cr@@ um@@ ble plant that it is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we will end to consider it as an unchanged case .
we believe that capit@@ alism leads to democ@@ racy .
this is not true .
Lee k@@ uan Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great re@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have proven two fel@@ low@@ ers that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capit@@ alism and impressive growth while policy is completely und@@ erl@@ ying .
in fact , the democ@@ racy is in fact in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece , -- the newly elected Greek government -- was not just@@ ified that the democ@@ ratic process of our country -- not the saving programs -- not the as@@ parag@@ us programs , which were divided in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there might be no better position for Lee k@@ uan Y@@ ew or the Commun@@ ist Party of Chin@@ as , or some of my inc@@ enti@@ ous friends that would say to me when they would change anything .
at this site I would like to present you a economical model for a real democ@@ racy .
I &apos;m going to believe in together with me , that Lee k@@ uan Y@@ ew , the Commun@@ ist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a errors , we could save us the democ@@ racy , but that we need a real and def@@ ective democ@@ racy .
because without Democ@@ racy , our soci@@ eties are mixed , our future , and our great and new technologies .
on the topic , I want to prove to a interesting cont@@ radi@@ ction that our establ@@ ish@@ ments are thre@@ at@@ ened to us .
I n@@ enne it the &quot; tw@@ ist Summit on par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known . you know and know him as the school of Scho@@ ol@@ berg , who is celebrating his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recogni@@ ze the school of the school ,
but only a few recogni@@ ze its tw@@ illing .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which could be inv@@ est to inv@@ est , where it would be inv@@ est to inv@@ est , where it could produce produc@@ tive to inv@@ est and all the things that is urg@@ ently need to man@@ kind , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars were invested in the U.S. and in the Euro@@ zone , in all the benef@@ ic@@ ising goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office building , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 Billi@@ ons US dollars is equal to a lot of money , to compare it with the 5,1 tr@@ illion dollars , which stood at the same time in the same country , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and real estate prices .
thus the debt and un@@ produc@@ tive capital the tw@@ ins are not ext@@ ingu@@ ished by the usual market mechanism .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating w@@ ages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , which would not be inv@@ est in which they cannot be inv@@ est in which they could not be inv@@ est , that his son would be to kill him when he will grow .
the circum@@ st@@ ances of circum@@ st@@ ances may lead that ec@@ di@@ pus should be k@@ illing him .
this is my h@@ ad@@ ern with capit@@ alism --
Art. all the un@@ produc@@ tive capital should be used to improve our life , human tal@@ ents and particularly all the technologies of finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are dec@@ is@@ ive for the salvation of the earth .
so is Democ@@ racy ?
I believe already . but before we proceed : what are we understand under Democ@@ racy ?
A@@ rist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democ@@ racy as the corporate form to control the air and the poor as a majority of the government .
of course , the ath@@ ian democ@@ racy graduated too many of --
women , fore@@ ign@@ ers , and of course sl@@ aves .
however , it would be an error , the job value of the ath@@ etic democ@@ racy due to these accounts .
the ma@@ kers on the ath@@ etic democ@@ racy was and is that she was not only the right to free differences expressed , but more important and dec@@ is@@ ive is that the right to political dec@@ is@@ ive with the same time vote in questions of the coup .
the ath@@ ian democ@@ racy has not kept long .
like a candle that illumin@@ ated very light , it is fast quickly .
however , our present liber@@ al democ@@ rac@@ ies have not been in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the gl@@ ad revolution of 1688 , even in the US Constitution .
during the Ukrainian democ@@ racy , based on the free citizens , the liber@@ al democ@@ racy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ulti@@ mat@@ ely a stat@@ ute for rul@@ ing .
because the liber@@ al democ@@ racy occurred just as a complete separation of polit@@ ics and economy by the democ@@ ratic process , while the economy -- so the world of conc@@ ern -- a democ@@ ratic zone was approved .
in our present democ@@ rac@@ ies since the time , in which the separation of polit@@ ics and economy began to aff@@ lic@@ ted the polit@@ ics between the polit@@ ics and the economy .
w@@ ond@@ ering why the polit@@ icians of polit@@ icians don &apos;t like previous ?
it is not located at a d@@ egen@@ eration of their DNA .
it is in fact that one can be used in the government , but still not in power because the power of polit@@ ics is emig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my h@@ ad@@ ern with capit@@ alism .
if you think it , it is in about as such as a herd of rob@@ ber@@ ing , that they fe@@ asi@@ zed the animals , from which they re@@ strain relief , that they cover them at the end of that .
simil@@ arly , it is simil@@ arly to the economy that grows as far can@@ ni@@ b@@ ulation . the power of conc@@ ern is growing , political goods are rising , the imp@@ unity of the conc@@ ern is to inv@@ est the cash of their company .
every suc@@ ces@@ ful of capit@@ alism decided to distri@@ bute the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democ@@ racy , the tw@@ ins are higher than the tw@@ ins of human work@@ force , and the benef@@ ic@@ ial of human workers and the char@@ ity of man@@ kind .
if this is true , it is ob@@ viously that we have to bring the polit@@ ics and the economy would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; would be in the antique Athens , apart from the excl@@ usion of sl@@ aves , the women and fore@@ ign@@ ers .
this is no new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist Lin@@ ke had already been doing this idea for 100 years ago and it was not very special .
the doc@@ trine from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be revealed that the poor arms was re@@ activated only through a mir@@ acle like in the antique Athens without creating new types of bro@@ od @-@ ality and loss .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
the capit@@ alism does it rep@@ aired by automation and rob@@ ots through automation and rob@@ ots .
the problem is so long economy and policy of separate areas , the process automation will be higher than that it will be very successful , and the social conflic@@ ts lower than it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come .
so , we have to rest@@ ore the economy and the areas of economy and policies de@@ voted in the field of democ@@ rati@@ os , otherwise we are re@@ au@@ c@@ racy in a disease monitoring , which allows the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question is not so whether the capit@@ alism will have the technical establishment , which he might have survi@@ ve , --
the interesting question is whether the capit@@ alism is used by a D@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; Matrix Trek &quot; , in the machinery and people will serve their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ena &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long singing the sense of life .
I believe we must be optimi@@ stic .
so , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like u@@ top@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in the practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in all reports .
in the area of companies : imag@@ ine a capital market , in which one is served , while you have worked from a working site to the next , and the company -- No matter what you will work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then ent@@ date all income from capital and lo@@ ving and the concept of w@@ age work is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
No differenti@@ ation more between them which are the company belong to work , and those who work there , but no de@@ gl@@ ing anymore between capital and work , no lo@@ op@@ ing between investment and freight , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely no emp@@ tions between investment and spo@@ ons , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely no emp@@ tions of tw@@ ins .
in the field of the global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely flu@@ ent exchange , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Mon@@ etary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerg@@ ing Mark@@ ets &#93; .
imag@@ ine that the entire world trade is in this currency , we call them &quot; the Kos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government p@@ ays the sum of the respective native to the respective country , in a common f@@ und .
imag@@ ine that this f@@ und is invest@@ ing in &quot; Green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment is r@@ ar .
this is no new idea .
it is in fact that John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Wo@@ ods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that man had not exp@@ ose the technical means that it was not to im@@ plement it .
today we have , particularly against the background of a re@@ uni@@ fied policy and economy .
the world , which I have been writing , is the same time , the liber@@ ated people are preferred , and mar@@ x@@ ist@@ isch , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of the history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ zed , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ zers .
but above all the other is a world where we can present a real democ@@ racy .
we are aw@@ ak@@ ening in such world
or will we do in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar h@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we deci@@ de to deci@@ de together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you will read yourself in your biography as the Liber@@ t@@ eres Mar@@ xi@@ ety .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something is what I have spoken , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ uni@@ fication of polit@@ ics and economy is not to generate a massive decline in the overall economic development , which Lar@@ ry Summ@@ ers &quot; is known as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next , as we see it , it will not only see our democ@@ rac@@ ies , but also the countries whose interest in Liber@@ al democ@@ racy is low .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is mostly relevant ,
likewise as Hay@@ ek , I &apos;m a liber@@ al Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and so I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t throw it , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a type of philos@@ oph@@ ical Declaration -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein that told Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Red@@ ner you have very clear what you think from the sight of Western Europe to China .
would you like to repeat this ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liber@@ al democ@@ rac@@ ies we have the ticket of a democ@@ racy .
as I told in my speech , we limited democ@@ racy limited to polit@@ ics , while the region where the most of the economy -- a completely democ@@ ratic zone .
in certain regard , when I may say that prov@@ oc@@ ative say that China is similar to England in the 19th century .
because -- Do not remember to connect Liber@@ alism with democ@@ racy -- which is an error , historical .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ al , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tic , which concern@@ s the democ@@ ratic development .
what is now ob@@ serve in China so res@@ embl@@ es very the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now , to do what the West in the 19th century has done this huge to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many sur@@ ve@@ ys have been cu@@ ri@@ ous to your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece of the Year .
Y@@ V : I ex@@ h@@ orted that this comes .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from the personal vision , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , for we had the opportunity to make the euro zone a new start ,
not only Greece , but the Euro@@ zone ,
nam@@ ely , by the self @-@ ri@@ pple , and lasting har@@ vest@@ ing , a massive reduction line through the Euro@@ zone ran , and continues to thre@@ at@@ ened the development of all the European Union .
we had the opportunity to see the foundation of the Greek lecture -- the way , the first proposal was , who revealed these le@@ aning -
it really too . unfortunately , the ma@@ ids have chosen within the European zone , within the European group , remains the le@@ aning .
but you know what is .
that is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you att@@ empt@@ ing an economic system that is not survi@@ ving , through political will and auth@@ orization to life , but if the change does not occur when then the change does he ab@@ ru@@ pt and destroyed .
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no dou@@ bt that the Euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you share any bug in your time as finance min@@ isters ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back -- seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ st@@ ressed situation , claims that he has no error , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ ake .
the biggest mist@@ akes was to sign the application for the extension of the training program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ est interest in the bank of the money , a joint solution .
but that gave it not .
they wanted to fall only our government , because they didn &apos;t work with the promises , which ran through the Euro@@ zone .
they did not see that she has led a cat@@ ast@@ ers program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nom@@ in@@ als GDP .
there is wor@@ se than during the &quot; Great De@@ pression . &quot;
No one from the Tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ug@@ h , who gave us this policy : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mist@@ ake . &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive form of tal@@ ks , you se@@ em to be still quite a European law .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my crit@@ ic@@ ism of the European Union and the Euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Euro@@ zone does not survi@@ ved .
because if they are not survi@@ ved , the acc@@ id@@ ental forces will destroy and destroy the European Union .
this is not alone for Europe dis@@ ast@@ ers , but for the entire global economy .
we &apos;re probably the stron@@ gest economy in the world .
if we see ourselves the way of a post@@ operative 1930 , w@@ on@@ ach it appears to me , it will also be asked for the future of Europe@@ ans as well as the non @-@ Europe@@ ans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong with that point wrong .
Y@@ an@@ is , many thanks that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price have never heard most , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjo@@ yable minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to met Roy before three years ago .
Roy Price is introduc@@ tory assistant at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
it is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ ding and describes on Twitter as well as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this shows , shows the shows and contents to the contents of the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy do not want any choice .
it must find shows that very well are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that at this curve on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the page IMDB . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one gets a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that is sweet , where one has been asked for your brain , where there are more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows shows like &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- which should be enough to tell you what at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not reali@@ ze on the left side of the curve , because I believe you need special intelligen@@ ce to offer &quot; Tod@@ d &apos;s and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the medium out@@ break , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad they do not thr@@ ust .
so , he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course , it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something always do Roy Price nothing .
he wants to strike achiev@@ ements .
it needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he particip@@ ates many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first epis@@ ode of each of this shows and will show them online where they can see everyone for free .
and if you want to out Amazon items , but does it work properly ?
millions of spectators are looking at this epis@@ odes .
however , they know not that they should be observed at the watch of this shows .
they will be observed by Roy and his team who can record everything .
they capture the show when you start the show when you want to look ahead and see again .
you collect million of data to deci@@ de to deci@@ de that show them should be producing .
in fact they collect the data , we work these and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- at the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so the average of this curve is 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average but not just the word to Roy and his team .
about the same time in another company has another man@@ agers through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always on the search to find such a Super show and he is still quite different .
instead of one competition , he and his team got the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews which shows the shows that shows that shows they like .
then use these data to find these little details about the spectators : which shows they like , which actors .
when they had made all the parts together , they went a car and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ator , but a dr@@ ama series over a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course is the question : what happened here ?
it has two very compet@@ itive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because the logic appear some@@ how that it should work for all .
if you collect million data collected for a decision to meet a decision to make a good decision .
it has 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is so not working , because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics , in order to meet serious dec@@ isions , far beyond television .
does one know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
No . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no@@ body comes in this room ever in contact with this software . come in touch , they are in prison .
if someone claims in the U.S. in prison , it is likely to determine that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like in Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deci@@ de whether a show good or bad will be decided whether one person is good or bad .
regular television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison is wor@@ se .
unfortunately , evidence is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generates . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data is also wrong .
Yes , even Google makes sometimes mist@@ ake .
in 2009 , Google announced that it allows data analysis of influ@@ ences of flu , the wor@@ st art , advance , -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news ensation . the success was in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked well @-@ free , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore .
and none could say why .
it did not work , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the withdraw@@ al of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most important companies such as Amazon and Google ab@@ underst@@ ood sometimes something .
despite all this error , data collected information in dec@@ isions of life -- at the workplace , on the legal basis , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
even I know many difficulties with data . I work in the comp@@ uter@@ ized gen@@ etics -- an area , in which some very cl@@ uge Men are un@@ able to meet many data to make serious dec@@ isions , as the decision for a cancer
or the development of a medic@@ ation . over the years I recognized some pattern to the difference between successful Decisions based on data and not successful dec@@ isions . this design should be wides@@ pre@@ ad .
if you solve a complex problem , do you do mainly two things :
as an initial result , you can analy@@ ze this problem so that you can analy@@ ze the components ; as a second set the components again to catch a dis@@ claim@@ ing .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how can help you can help to understand a problem and to understand his parts .
they are not suitable to use the parts again and then to come to a decision .
there is another tool and we have all : our brain .
if there is something , when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is impossible to leave the brain -- especially when it is the brain of a experts .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they are part of the process .
you are using data to understand how to understand the audience better . but the decision , how to take all these parts , and out of it a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; it does not work in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what would be a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon Att@@ ach against this in the false way .
they used data to control all their dec@@ isions , first when they have selected TV @-@ ideas as they chose the Alpha House as show .
it was a safe decision because they could say : &quot; that tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better dec@@ isions , but I believe that things continue to control our dec@@ isions .
No matter how do they are , data are only a tool , and to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before it was data , this is the device for dec@@ isions .
many know it .
it also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for dec@@ isions with the help of a Ja@@ une or no @-@ question you need to get the ball c@@ shake to get a answer . &quot; highly probably &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I &apos;ll be able to replace it with a techniques .
I have taken some dec@@ isions to my life in my life , where I would have to hear the ball for the ball .
but as you know , as you know , if you want to replace the data , you want to replace this by a little bit much s@@ worn , such as data analysis , to make better dec@@ isions .
but this does not change the basic construction .
so perhaps the ball sounds and cl@@ ü@@ ger . finally it is to meet dec@@ isions when we want to reach a little exceptional right at the end of the right curve .
and I also recom@@ men@@ ds that it is still p@@ ays to meet dec@@ isions despite the great quantity of data still p@@ ays to meet dec@@ isions to be an expert on what you do , and risks .
because at the end there are not the data , but risks , with which you turn right at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
