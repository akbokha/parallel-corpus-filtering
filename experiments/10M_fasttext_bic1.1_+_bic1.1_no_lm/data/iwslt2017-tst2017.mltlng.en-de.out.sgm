<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You know him because he won the New York Times reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before a man had heard of Edward Snowden, he wrote Risen a book on which he published the NSA illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should be a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In therein, he describes a catasters of US intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally surprisoned for a attributor by Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds clear, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know what the chapter did not forget?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government filed against Risen and asked him to call his supposedly sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the samples of the government, Whistleblower to be split and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to release secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it's impossible to use this right when media will not get information and if they do not protect the identity of the mud.</seg>
<seg id="14">So as the government of Risen, did he did something to put what many courageing reporter had already before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to pass in prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 he lived Risen with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days prior to the trial, a somewhat outer usual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly though she was longlang, that it would definitely be found to fall in their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the meantime, the reporter and sources can always be hidden less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of snakes and robots to bring back to the statements, which might also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigator, without his conception, his phone at home was orgasm,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel information with the list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of these information, they found them that they used Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and risks attached to the source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama said to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the justice has more convicted than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government can be opened too much of their work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national safety the result that a Whistleblower went into a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work in the game which is protected by the first constitutional view, because the government has always more possibilities to use any more possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government allows the right of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And although they can contact the moment, in which they can contact, instead of them in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, it's communication software that had not yet been written when Risen had written book, and it is much more safe than normal E-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is securely, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous that was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working here.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of an e-mail, you walk to an News website, as it is the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can download documents or information, as for each ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and saved on a server to access only the relevant news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government cannot preserves more information and many of the information which would like to request, would be no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a little part of the whole to protect the press release in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, in all the world, governments are always the new Spionagettechnologies, which are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to ensure that not only technological believers like Edward Snowden has an option to make miserates. it is so important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The more about abuses in the supply of soldiers pleid knows and of overfill health houses. or the next environmental management, the alarm to retain water of Flint. or a pilgrimst insider that warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only for those who want to cover crimes to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest dates back to the history.] [that] the "Panama Papers"] [is] what does this week we have hidden from news on a statement.] this week we have been hidden from news about an Leck of 11 million documents in Panama enrolling anchop mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the control box.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of which customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbags Fonseca, and say: "Okay, we need an anonymous company. you can use it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the e-mails, the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a prohibition of the brutal dictators Baschar al-Assad mailbox in staroasen.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads through a narrow friend of childhood, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now it will be there outside a lot of numerous people and others, the nervous will wait for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agencies or a John Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weaves from you, me, common people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should us say that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and courageous in the location are to hide and not all their taxes, then this is less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerned us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these doings are phalomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret taxies of some few were used to hide and borrowers -- anything, which we have been discussed and unctions for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears to understand this whole world, and it's hard to understand how this tax is work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always give it as a Matrjzikapuppe for me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has another company in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand why it is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal offence and tax authorities, as well as journalists or the civil society really understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there was no prominent Americans, who arrived in these enthusiasts that scandal came.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not so that there are no American Americans that hiding your property in tax.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, through the principle, after that this staroasen, Moscowlings has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We had a data run of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it's so that you need to obtain less information, less information is necessary to get a company to green than a library ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed the employees of debt displaying school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been extensively permitted to locate especially anorable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior who affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with global widness, we'll need to figure out how all this in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we have a covered Erler in the offices of 13 shares in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave birth to an African minister, who wanted to bring a home money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We shocked that all of up to a lawyer of our investigator proposal made how he might be transferring his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prehistoric times. none of this lawyers took us as clients who was transferred to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that this is not as single accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not going to have an individual lawyer that has spread the investigated proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It doesn't work for a single peak beam, managed in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's why the system works, through the corruption, tax refuge, poverty, and instability become established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to do this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may anything very trace, as if we could do nothing; as if nothing could have changed, as if it is always the rich and courageous.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when the optimum optimism should I take it to change that.</seg>
<seg id="85">Within the last few years we have seen precautions to more transparency, which concerns the owner of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been listed in Central Registern on national level, who's really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US has left behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentations, but this makes not the progress to see that we would like.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would like to see how this Panama enthusiasts, this huge insight into the world of the control box, used in the U.S. and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at the Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need usual people who want to see how other people are hidden their true identity behind the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that stand and say: "Intransparency is not good for the shop."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need the leading politicians who recognize the problem and to end this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finish the intransparent, which now need this kind of tax refuge, corruption and money wash.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I would like almost kidnapped and in the trunk room of a red Macroet would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a Hindhofstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in red Mazda stayed and looked up my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city, and just a roadtrip through the country. afterwards he would go to Friedenscorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I lude him at beer. he told me excited as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made him the mistake him: "where do you look for today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I know it not."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I get now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I didn't know him yet! he says to the peace of peace, but I don't know if it is the really plans. I will not deceived in the trunk room of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">Night I was in bed, I stared to the blanket, and thought: "Oh man! what haven't I rocks here?</seg>
<seg id="114">A sustrange sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a fear, that I was out of the bed, on titular tips to the door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The art works that he had bought from me now in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as the host. it has changed my angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people were sold in childhood as a stranger, actually, friends that were waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Men on my air Mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I participated the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a timing, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost Pleite, my members living and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I drove that there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can create, fear of fun in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new members of Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've got superior to you. our apartment will stay at a Designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay together, Wi-Fi and a desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded as "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese-ham and melamine cover completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We touring with them through the whole city. when we fell our last guest, and the door to the castle, starred Brian and I am.</seg>
<seg id="134">We had just discovered that we can find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-resident, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure whether you could find out of a business team.</seg>
<seg id="138">So, we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to prepare a site, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are gone.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the internet you can easily invite more wildlife people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This is the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We was waiting that the missile would come.</seg>
<seg id="142">Did she do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still quite with Trost, would invest in a business which allows you to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all of them that stranger are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have an issue, you have used to things that can easily be good. we were able to be able.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we had learned much more than just view and haptics -- it is the overall plan.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to build objects, but now we wanted to create a great confidence, between people who never had taken before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design such a bit?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a KOSTPROBE, which grade confidence is to be rebelled.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it is out of your comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs high if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your cell phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlock mobile phone with your left seats.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic, you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel that the first time to open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only, what is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So many guests feel the most guests where they can comfortably sleep.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who has actually all Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you decide on Twitter that he must support for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now experienced, what kind of trust we want to rebuild this. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail to this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your descendants can be presented once again with his name; if he could have been told how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you, they would have 150 assessments, saying, "It can really be very well maintained."</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you enter your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-based feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people, negative encounters.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait till both hosts will be given as a guest as a guest, before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford a study. we examined that people can trust in one another, depending on the age and the residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we trust the people in most, who are on similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">We can find more differences, the desto less trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social security engineer.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is to be added if you add the reputation to a person -- in our case.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, do not change anything.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of the community.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep marghts.</seg>
<seg id="186">We drove that trust is dependent on how much is from there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When one tells us, how for example, "Hi!", you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">In much, how for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request will also be rather accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree for openness, e.g. "Tolle art works in your apartment! I will make it with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to restore this degree?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text to recommend the correct lot of text. we also give tips to which topics can be something else.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our company is based on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our preceding components.</seg>
<seg id="194">In what we had not expected, the great quantity of people who were more than ready to set these advantages.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our teams.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is just fine for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times if not all is smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated the unpermitted party or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Host hosts will leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at front front if confidence is broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it's hurt when I think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that heareth in the voice of prupt, and is still our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million resettled overnights only a fraction ever.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people deceived other to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence is working, Wonderfully can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts came to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who figured to heart inferious activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angel that save lives of a life even though they don't know not.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one of your own car in the hospital when you die, and waiting for a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel that they don't feel books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can pay a longer stay without any extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, course does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I asked for the first time over this concept, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with ATM transaction together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here around a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now just "rental industry" to call it, the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade and the human relationship.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you get ready to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would however, if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if on every place where you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and one at a bupense tour quarter, of which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to remove flats from the reason to the Miteinandertation?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities mean the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I bring my cities before, who permit us and relationships, instead of loneliness and incline.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital, Seoul was already begun. many parking lots that belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Now they have been offered. students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were investigated in humans, whose children were underwent, Incubator were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone there are 785 000 people in 191 countries, a stranger, or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy about how it was put to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We do not invented the wheel in the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Also there was no hospitality also.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why does it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from Happiness and Timing we noted that you can find the correct design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome down the preceding components.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the verblossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think any time in order to pass a red Mazda in me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know that design does not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But when it could help us if it had this large effect, I ask myself, what we can use it to use it.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terrorist band?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on security approach at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I give you not the school for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media people are so look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the report about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans my most would have no Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people did not speak with her Uber trips.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never have a must know: it is great, you do not know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say you, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am afraid,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seeding-fitness fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practice, spiritual muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga singt, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I chose to write me.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outing me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexueller man, as some of my friends, but when Muslimin. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends stayed here: "why are you repressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Funny was: at that time I was a feminist independence of Independence, in contrast to the pressure, which I felt as a 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and inachievable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only pass the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to gered with the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought on, exhibited in question, two and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at the first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and scourage that was deepened with every reading of the body.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmic brings me sometimes to Wone.</seg>
<seg id="285">I'm aware of myself. I feel that God knows.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that any man takes you, but somehow loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, as all the good Egyptians, my career as engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the grave of the Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then there was a terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember what they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had ed at the end of the morning, looked up on the screen and saw the word "Eilcking" "</seg>
<seg id="293">It was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spout of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">A accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical interference?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock, walked quickly in Employment.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">I moved the television channel and heard: "... Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It's not only my country has been attacked, but in Nu destroyed me the works of other of a citizenship in a nation.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to go through the West West of the USA to pull into a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we swept at -- as we swept out -- so deep it went to my seat in my seat, and I was detected in my seat for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="304">We went in this night in our apartment in a new town in which there is like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, when I heard, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, which was growing: "be growing," "Be" "" "" "Abd melt" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in those week -- the day in Muslims to gather there.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warning: "goes not to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive report of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were uniluted and I heard of attacked on Muslims or of people that he held for Muslims, and smote for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire connection on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land, our country attacked.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the courage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine me! I was also wager.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain in itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the schoolations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can listen to people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims and close to Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about the village of Tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we solved or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor removes as a whole and a gutters tumor stops just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are such as all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a living important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, initial helpers and the Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of Moscheen America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might be a few parking lots, but not the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque is to consider some other faith tolerant, and major civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told, people are really not detected in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in her cellars or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">It has established that he starts online. as a first, the person who believes, even from their family, that the person believes, that the person believes, that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who do their behaviour and their ideology, is a reiterate or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent Radialisation, we need to keep the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still preserve, Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group as the IS had its brood-ality with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslimin, as a mother when I believe that we must do all to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add us into their approach world when you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion creditors.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS so much with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-KLAN with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups can claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at it, it doesn't know what they do in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brood-ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they prediccurtains the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him, whether they have been in contact with radical religious driver.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the contrary. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, brought them to silence, and told her, their sense of iniquity in the world, they would only be in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired by nothing, who would have given their worthy sense, she was a main goal for the instrumental champagne, which gave their own solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of them for their wage, he showed her constructive ways for an effective change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learn in the mosque, keep it before the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamopposition me and my family affects.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it works to normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour convention from fear every day to our democracy from our thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several recent studies -- show: if we fear us, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you reports test persons messages presented, in which negative over Muslims, they voted more military attacked on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood for Muslims to the top, -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times, but never dies in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the field of the war period and during two standard periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamopposition is not just the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expect it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to explain the foundations of a free company, which has sensible and well informational citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel perhaps as the first but the toxic air of fear of anxiety us.</seg>
<seg id="368">During the assignment of collective school, it is not only about to deceive itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both come to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say that he was the sweet, and the gigantic man had been called.</seg>
<seg id="373">She attended him there, and he showed his life imprisonment. she was blooming, saying,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my brothers, become a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne for her brother and his wife, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been murdered in her apartment, as in one direction, after he was posted to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He foss eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be unmoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we went to the mosque or remained at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We practise it and for us there was no light decision, for it was going to pass through our children: one that would check us through fear through fear, or that we can try our religion for our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the kindergarten we left flourly, with high pressure for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went my shoes, went into prayer, and what I looked, made me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam was a proclamation, and called our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhist, atheists, believers and non-believers who came to attack us, but to stand us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I'm collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they were Mut, and co-feel of panic and anterior chamber.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you select at the moment of fear and the Fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you know where my: we are better than the.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seemed to have a nervoid.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask me what do you say that you can claim a TEDTalk, a monument with draught are working in a noble monuments, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to people?</seg>
<seg id="398">DALIA Mogahed: I would say, let you feel not. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually how it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims on the whole world, and I opened the biggest one of the people with the world, want people normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to relax for the family, they want to live and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not a exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception, then it is usually broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. DALIA Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What as a platform for Basters started shortly before, a milliardeneries.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drug. made in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packages in our social sciousness, has an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France, a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks were built. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Multiple devices achieve high speed and acceleration across the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independent structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads with turbulences, to react with turbulences and react.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we wish to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the borders of the mower in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to know a system autonom, it has to know the collective damage to know where the mobile objects are in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we have no external cameras to focus objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External command exists to the highest ebde. e.g. "start" and "landen."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrackle, it is efficient in the return flight efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most powerful whisers, it can be silent, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailfails is that they react to turbulences like wind bids.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind is that the flight unit does not run the optimal position in which the optimal position can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic attention to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for about machines with a thousand moving parts, which are merged to violate.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades the pilots could fly the pilots, which had only two movable parts: a propellers and a tailruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlongest, we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanical easiest operated flight unit. it was found in front of short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folding, hinges and transversal, no further actuators or controls, only one propellers.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simpel, happens in the inner life, that it can fly very stable, and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it doesn't know about the elegant algorithm of the tailpiece. to bring it to fool you must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to design it exactly right now, if I am all of it is small, I will be filmed a video that is filmed yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospace is a exercise in Genüver, this machine is here with eight propellers, exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is balanced balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the final capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the space to move in all directions, no matter what the direction of he is turned or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">One time is adjustable in models, the rest will be redeem directly when the flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines will be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safely and safely.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller drive machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These rotates clockwise in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it, how a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a little bit, a motor or propellers falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can also be flying the machine if even restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate it, making half a half gate.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic sakes.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet on aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual Micro Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and rats them with localizing technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit white, where it is in room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motively motivate these demonstrations, the new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine that you want to get a flying lamp lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it's difficult to forecasts the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as we find the wages in the development and the Schaffensact.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, as wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it is creativity to form them to form a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology solves massive and economical potential is the door on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago in a very far away galaxy, two black holes are always faster, you emigrated to the mass of three suns on a tenth month in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, she shawless than all stars together in all the galaxies of the entire hotel.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great buall.</seg>
<seg id="472">They were not able to set your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We eventually speak of black soldering holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been given into the room-TIME-GEGUGE itself and the Universe exploded in Gravitality.</seg>
<seg id="475">We start the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">In front of 1.3 billion years ago, several hundred life was produced on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth: corals, fish, plants, saucans, humans and -- God understand us at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group is particularly Muenster -- Rai White from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detector to seek after gravitational shaft.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of those kept them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew it as verified genies that the U.S. National Science Foundation will finance her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of decades, design, conception and extremely much harter work, they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of LIGO could be considerably improved, which improved its recognition.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we called Advanced LIGO at Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a recent test run to clarify some minor flaws.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after commissioning of the detector, the gravitation wave of the two colored black holes caused by the earth through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than that:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todsiken Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In the grave they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I worked for I had no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he studied gravitational shaft such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational shaft?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a balanced in the GEOT of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the previous wave, the space, and its total content will be stretched into a direction and stretched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate Dozard, in Kursk to the Relative act is often a really albering dance on.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and slice, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational shaft is extremely weak, even smile.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, everyone stretched from us at the meeting of waves and stretched. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is called 20 Nullen according to the comma, followed by a 1, I declared the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, which is already absurd, and it's already absurd, the length is measured on less than a thousandths of a atomic core. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Abrasion Kip Thorne, a co-founder of the LIGOs, the hunt for the waves: "the technical difficulties when the construction of such detectors are mighty.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are invention and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overthrown. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before its success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. scott claims that LIGO is more an ear than a eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things for us: visual excerpts, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for such as you can use a picture or card of your dyeing by several points by using several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">At tones is the different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audiences have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of Dingen that is particularly much mean:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice" now.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is considered to gravitational shaft.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't use any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But we are looking forward to Amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO meet the measured frequencies in the headphones range.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we convert wave pattern in barn, we can listen to the All booking.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to laugh, can hide themselves about much about the collision of two black holes, wherewith my colleague Scott already employed.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, about it easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two bodies very quickly, hear the same circus with an additional clay change. it sounds like: WU-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion transformer, inserted in the shaft form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date, at least I never forget to hear, when at least I have never forget, recognize this as noise of -- SH:... two black soldering holes with 30-fold solar weight, which makes about as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us overlay ourselves that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the sealing body in All, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, one hundred times per second before they are collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It is the lead-meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a reasonable new way to exploring the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All lautern and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many in all, we can see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen but in the core, which is hidden behind thousands kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see that they are opaque because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational shines of iron, when it would be transparent glass. the Urknall: I would have searching the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see, because of the urged by his own disaster.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using Gravitational shaft, it should be possible to draw up until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I'm optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see, and of which we don't have any presentation. things that we're only going to hear.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO occurred in the first start of things which we had not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project says to this topic: me: the type of stars that were observed, such as LIGO they are observed, the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are solicable on our archeological work for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us a completely viewing to the events in all, on the birth of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists since then to be possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build large detectors and the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could beautiful be more than the urged yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Before some time I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year long would I say to all "Yes!" say, before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it was afraid, me in unpleasant situations, I forced to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I wanted live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I wanted to start with the Schauplay?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</seg>
<seg id="563">And a returning thing: exactly that I was afraid, wovor I feared me.</seg>
<seg id="564">My anxiety to keep my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes" has changed my life. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes" changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life, on an unexpectedly art. it began with a question of my small.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, The Smallest, calls from unexplained reasons, "</seg>
<seg id="570">When she was a waitinerary from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimates, I need milk for my snail."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me, if I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said, "Yes". "</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swears me to play with them. No matter what I just do, or whither, I say always Yes -- every one time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect but I felt very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blooming side effect: just before short, I was actually, that the "Yes" Sages to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things I have chosen to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I cancel television. I reproductive television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have been doing television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for this, 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours TV. three up to four shows are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that were not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television calendar can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three shipments: Scandal, 15 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">My TV series are running on Thursday at the Thursday evening in America.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world you run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million people.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments, which I used himself, and not only produced, so even above. I must find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans and my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfire that are around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">No, I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "Author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, that all of you are so hard, if I have a company, a country or a classroom, that I don't know that I say: I understand that I say, I understand that there is not a dream of dream.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I have much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I am tied in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country from the kidney.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops, than pickled I on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a drefe one high sound, he depth a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creatively, mechanically, strict and resisting, funny and interference, gratically and maternal, cruel and sensible, and the best of it is.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows in my head, and it grows like a revival road, I could always go for you.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take place when I explaned them that I will say unto them that I have prepared my write to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summen -- as I started working with the TV production when I started to work and to do, to create and disassembling, discovered this matter, this sums, these energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The summing is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summen is action and activity. the Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Summen is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The summing is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have sums as a sums, you're not different than to the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to streches, than according to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means a workgolic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is true.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is it to go.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the anxiety times.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know that I made not for the failure, and I know that I love the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make a clear: each succesful I will report, each more episodes, the more details, the more information, the more things that I have been more than I am history, more than I am history, so much more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">Ever I have been working to work successfully, the desto more must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country that I create a marathon, the army, which I run the army, the screen, the high sound, the Summen, the Summen, the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the Summen. I am the summing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this Summen?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then he stops the summing.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overload, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The summing stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to accustomed the truth that their Mama is one single workers.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells men: "my Mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimates, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the Summen had heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The semen of the engine ummers.</seg>
<seg id="650">I love my work no longer. the engine was.</seg>
<seg id="651">The summing went back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15-hours-days, no Reue, nothing delegates, a Titanium sleeps, is not available, with all your hearts, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">Silence was silent in me.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an Show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summen and the Summen was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">What do you know what you do, the work that loves you, suddenly connected?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know about some of you: "Heul you out of, blossom the author of Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know it, you will do, one teacher to be a teacher, a mother called to be a teacher, a mother called to be a mother, and knows how to know the summing, and knows how to stop the sums, if the summing stops away, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When I hear the song of my heart, I can survive the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then, my "Südstates-Kellnerin" is a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way back outside, late dran and she says, "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say, when I will see two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all, and second, they knew me not. "</seg>
<seg id="675">They called no more "estimates."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is it?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan bin and my sums up, and here it changes all of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so said they: "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters, we laughing much and I tasty very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's edingly, because my pain and my panic in the loneliness, and in absence of the Summens, I can do nothing to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am foamed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country that I create a marathon, the marathon, the army, the army that are high sound - they often have no more.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists for sticky fingers and moist, delicate voices, watch crayons and the song, in which it is going to leave the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so almost that I can hardly athe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I ate.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something is dissolves in me.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy feed comes up.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that didn't know, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly because it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel to know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay at the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. No secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have gotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The summing, the employ, which is titanium ensummen, that is only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, if I say to you, who I am I write with the help of shipments and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I am forget what the real Summen is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent of joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The summing is electricity, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summen is Self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignobled the pressure of the history that can be used to erasing tasks that expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The genuine Summen is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real Summen is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps the promised God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan bin?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child will play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I have been doing this, so that I can open me as a workforce of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no other option, if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not well in playing, I like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play it not yet to play as such as work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I have been working here, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better on the workplace than daheim.</seg>
<seg id="726">This one is painful, for what a man works better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Sometimes I honest me "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am relaxed, is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have around the garden around, before and back, go and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We cut tea bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I felt mainly steif, abdominal and confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always premature after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children will show me how to lives, and the Summen of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I'm playing and play, until I ask me: why we have heard the games of playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! tell you Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me for naiv, for a day.</seg>
<seg id="742">Because you have right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be less interesting to think when you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones would like to play 15 minutes with me to do so that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, some of the Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenie daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, it is not required.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes on each piece, even on a bad-loader day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no linen, not included.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it must not be the children. it is not the children to feel the sums to have a place for his sailings.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not able to play with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "playing" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes away!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect. I'm sure and I wins. friends, books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" "" "" "" "what I was given that I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to make myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on each, why not walk for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The Summen came back in my leisure time. the summing seems to return when I work not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It needs time, but after a few months open a door, the energy streams, and I find me in my office. I hear me to new ideas. I use it out his way. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the summing, the Summen is not I... no longer.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of mine, but only one part. and therefore I am so dankable.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me, that I'm a Titan am. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And still I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my inventory is still working.</seg>
<seg id="781">For more I games, the more happy I have and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">For more I games, the more feel better than good mothers.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the destiny is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">For more I games, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">For more I games, the greater I will hear the Summen. the land which I create the marathon, which I run, the troops, the veil, the summing, the Summen, the Summen, the others, the real Summen: the Summen of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">Ever I feel this Summen, the desto more makes this unusual, baked, naked and new life experience in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">For more I am exactly this Summen, the desto more know, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I have chosen to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">It belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this Jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little tolerant.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" too less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurochirurgin.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from a second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike to other bodily, a very low skill for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, the patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I functional Neurochirurgin has been developed.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgery?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly from one of the most well known, the "Tiefenirstimulation." are implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the switching circuits so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which litters under heavy painters and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">My opinion, we approaches us this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">A little help can help the brain itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was introductory Oberärtin and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often tested patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata the brain is weakened and indicates the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, you must decrease the skirt pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this way you have to remove a part of the shepherd balance.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen shepherd balance, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues who analyze Hirnmass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What I do so?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue growth is comparable with all young children who can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to make this cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This is he regarded under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It was just like a Chief cell culture. with great green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know not know from the organic lessons that the cells are inmature cells that can walk in any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has grown cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of tricells from the surface tissue of the shepherd balance in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We had a further fascinating observation: normal cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells should be different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like in the cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how he came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are from this cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our cerebral caves off.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the Fötus she provide the feeding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why did they maintain us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they have been participating in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations near the brain.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from this cells, we received our original cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand from a potential cell source that allows the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">It had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain in the non-speaking region and then rinse the cells exactly as well as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then to mark the colors to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step reimplated them at the deserable deserable deserate.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplantation -- author transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we happen this cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimate the same cells in the brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we observed the cells in a healthy brain, and we were taken out after some weeks, they would be taken back home. the room is already occupied it, they will not be used there, so it disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we found a violation and reimplated exactly the same cells and well, the cells continued to attack neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show they are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not be heard of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a hencement?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we do no monkey with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed wood from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">That they did very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When she achieved a stable skill level, we had reached the motorized in motorized in motorized.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were male, they could not move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just like it would happen, it would recover spontaneously up to a washed degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are mowing and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover up to a certain degree, just as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the Monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation, implically we had its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See, when we reimplantated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rich plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other newer versions, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still always to impose them with humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I hope really, that I can show you soon as the human brain has to heal yourself to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely at any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical studies in human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to assess about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is of course, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look in the future -- you have completed research and dismissed the permission to look at the future of clinical trials. if you are going to come into the future, as many years it will take to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it be the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then we have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It's already a long time to choose the treatments to evaluate treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one needs to apply to a multi-central study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really refer to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and tells us that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We see in the West make a big mistake to consider of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy not considered the crumble plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We will end to consider it as an unchanged case.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee kuan Yew from Singapore and its great reahmer in Beijing have proven two fellowers that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while policy is completely underlying.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy is in fact in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece, -- the newly elected Greek government -- was not justified that the democratic process of our country -- not the saving programs -- not the asparagus programs, which were divided in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there might be no better position for Lee kuan Yew or the Communist Party of Chinas, or some of my incentious friends that would say to me when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this site I would like to present you a economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I'm going to believe in together with me, that Lee kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a errors, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a real and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without Democracy, our societies are mixed, our future, and our great and new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic, I want to prove to a interesting contradiction that our establishments are threatened to us.</seg>
<seg id="915">I nenne it the "twist Summit on paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known. you know and know him as the school of Schoolberg, who is celebrating his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the school of the school,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which could be invest to invest, where it would be invest to invest, where it could produce productive to invest and all the things that is urgently need to mankind, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the U.S. and in the Eurozone, in all the beneficising goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office building, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billions US dollars is equal to a lot of money, to compare it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which stood at the same time in the same country, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus the debt and unproductive capital the twins are not extinguished by the usual market mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, which would not be invest in which they cannot be invest in which they could not be invest, that his son would be to kill him when he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">The circumstances of circumstances may lead that ecdipus should be killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our life, human talents and particularly all the technologies of finance, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is Democracy?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we proceed: what are we understand under Democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form to control the air and the poor as a majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the athian democracy graduated too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the job value of the athetic democracy due to these accounts.</seg>
<seg id="934">The makers on the athetic democracy was and is that she was not only the right to free differences expressed, but more important and decisive is that the right to political decisive with the same time vote in questions of the coup.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athian democracy has not kept long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminated very light, it is fast quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not been in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glad revolution of 1688, even in the US Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">During the Ukrainian democracy, based on the free citizens, the liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy occurred just as a complete separation of politics and economy by the democratic process, while the economy -- so the world of concern -- a democratic zone was approved.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies since the time, in which the separation of politics and economy began to afflicted the politics between the politics and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why the politicians of politicians don't like previous?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is in fact that one can be used in the government, but still not in power because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think it, it is in about as such as a herd of robbering, that they feasized the animals, from which they restrain relief, that they cover them at the end of that.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similarly to the economy that grows as far cannibulation. the power of concern is growing, political goods are rising, the impunity of the concern is to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">Every succesful of capitalism decided to distribute the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the twins are higher than the twins of human workforce, and the beneficial of human workers and the charity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obviously that we have to bring the politics and the economy would be better if the "demos" would be in the antique Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist Linke had already been doing this idea for 100 years ago and it was not very special.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be revealed that the poor arms was reactivated only through a miracle like in the antique Athens without creating new types of brood-ality and loss.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">The capitalism does it repaired by automation and robots through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is so long economy and policy of separate areas, the process automation will be higher than that it will be very successful, and the social conflicts lower than it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So, we have to restore the economy and the areas of economy and policies devoted in the field of democratios, otherwise we are reaucracy in a disease monitoring, which allows the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not so whether the capitalism will have the technical establishment, which he might have survive, --</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether the capitalism is used by a Dystopia, similar to the "Matrix Trek", in the machinery and people will serve their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athena "Agora," in long singing the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So, how could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in all reports.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: imagine a capital market, in which one is served, while you have worked from a working site to the next, and the company -- No matter what you will work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then entdate all income from capital and loving and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation more between them which are the company belong to work, and those who work there, but no degling anymore between capital and work, no looping between investment and freight, and ultimately no emptions between investment and spoons, and ultimately no emptions of twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of the global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluent exchange, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is in this currency, we call them "the Kosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government pays the sum of the respective native to the respective country, in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "Green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment is rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is in fact that John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that man had not expose the technical means that it was not to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, particularly against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I have been writing, is the same time, the liberated people are preferred, and marxistisch, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of the history, and keynesized, global keynesizers.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all the other is a world where we can present a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are awakening in such world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we do in a "Matrix" - similar hystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You will read yourself in your biography as the Liberteres Marxiety.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something is what I have spoken, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is not to generate a massive decline in the overall economic development, which Larry Summers "is known as" long-term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next, as we see it, it will not only see our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in Liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is mostly relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, I'm a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and so I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't throw it, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a type of philosophical Declaration -- YV: actually it was Einstein that told Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Redner you have very clear what you think from the sight of Western Europe to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat this?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the ticket of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I told in my speech, we limited democracy limited to politics, while the region where the most of the economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain regard, when I may say that provocative say that China is similar to England in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- Do not remember to connect Liberalism with democracy -- which is an error, historical.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberal, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptic, which concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What is now observe in China so resembles very the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now, to do what the West in the 19th century has done this huge to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many surveys have been curious to your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I exhorted that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: Yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from the personal vision, and very disappointing, for we had the opportunity to make the euro zone a new start,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, by the self-ripple, and lasting harvesting, a massive reduction line through the Eurozone ran, and continues to threatened the development of all the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to see the foundation of the Greek lecture -- the way, the first proposal was, who revealed these leaning -</seg>
<seg id="1008">It really too. unfortunately, the maids have chosen within the European zone, within the European group, remains the leaning.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you attempting an economic system that is not surviving, through political will and authorization to life, but if the change does not occur when then the change does he abrupt and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you share any bug in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who look back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, especially in a so-stressed situation, claims that he has no error, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistakes was to sign the application for the extension of the training program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest in the bank of the money, a joint solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that gave it not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to fall only our government, because they didn't work with the promises, which ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not see that she has led a catasters program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominals GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one from the Troika's trough, who gave us this policy: "that was a colossaler mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive form of talks, you seem to be still quite a European law.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if they are not survived, the accidental forces will destroy and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This is not alone for Europe disasters, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We're probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we see ourselves the way of a postoperative 1930, wonach it appears to me, it will also be asked for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong with that point wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, many thanks that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price have never heard most, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to met Roy before three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is introductory assistant at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">It is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelding and describes on Twitter as well as "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this shows, shows the shows and contents to the contents of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy do not want any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">It must find shows that very well are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that at this curve on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the page IMDB. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one gets a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that is sweet, where one has been asked for your brain, where there are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- which should be enough to tell you what at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not realize on the left side of the curve, because I believe you need special intelligence to offer "Todd's and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the medium outbreak, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad they do not thrust.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course, it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something always do Roy Price nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to strike achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He participates many ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and will show them online where they can see everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if you want to out Amazon items, but does it work properly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are looking at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they know not that they should be observed at the watch of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They will be observed by Roy and his team who can record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture the show when you start the show when you want to look ahead and see again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect million of data to decide to decide that show them should be producing.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact they collect the data, we work these and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- at the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so the average of this curve is 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average but not just the word to Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time in another company has another managers through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always on the search to find such a Super show and he is still quite different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of one competition, he and his team got the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews which shows the shows that shows that shows they like.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find these little details about the spectators: which shows they like, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had made all the parts together, they went a car and decided to do not a Sitcom over four Senator, but a drama series over a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic appear somehow that it should work for all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect million data collected for a decision to meet a decision to make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is so not working, because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics, in order to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does one know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody comes in this room ever in contact with this software. come in touch, they are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone claims in the U.S. in prison, it is likely to determine that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like in Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show good or bad will be decided whether one person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Regular television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison is worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, evidence is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generates. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes sometimes mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it allows data analysis of influences of flu, the worst art, advance, -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news ensation. the success was in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked well-free, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And none could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most important companies such as Amazon and Google abunderstood sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all this error, data collected information in decisions of life -- at the workplace, on the legal basis, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Even I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area, in which some very cluge Men are unable to meet many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some pattern to the difference between successful Decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this design should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you solve a complex problem, do you do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As an initial result, you can analyze this problem so that you can analyze the components; as a second set the components again to catch a disclaiming.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how can help you can help to understand a problem and to understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to use the parts again and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something, when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is impossible to leave the brain -- especially when it is the brain of a experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they are part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You are using data to understand how to understand the audience better. but the decision, how to take all these parts, and out of it a show like "House of Cards," it does not work in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what would be a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon Attach against this in the false way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they have selected TV-ideas as they chose the Alpha House as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could say: "that tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things continue to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how do they are, data are only a tool, and to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this is the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions with the help of a Jaune or no-question you need to get the ball cshake to get a answer. "highly probably" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll be able to replace it with a techniques.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have taken some decisions to my life in my life, where I would have to hear the ball for the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But as you know, as you know, if you want to replace the data, you want to replace this by a little bit much sworn, such as data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic construction.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball sounds and clüger. finally it is to meet decisions when we want to reach a little exceptional right at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I also recommends that it is still pays to meet decisions despite the great quantity of data still pays to meet decisions to be an expert on what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end there are not the data, but risks, with which you turn right at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
