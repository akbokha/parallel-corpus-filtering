the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ ation in Bavaria of the State Government , all other as currently - but just a very short circuit .
especially if you have the current Online @-@ cards .

the French army leader in Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War of Austria .
Napoleon wishes an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ ern@@ s in order - of course of military purposes .
even if the French troops combined with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , there were the present neigh@@ bo@@ urs , which gave the idea of a be@@ ading area of Bavaria @-@ map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau . &quot;
the ur@@ inary sheet for Munich is from 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the fruit of fruit / Today is on the example of the state capital of the state in the state of the state .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown to all directions .
an example is sub@@ m@@ apped , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .

where today is the West@@ park , you can see nothing more than fields - in the first sight of a smaller card with do@@ zen lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered copies from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ s &quot; which was derived from the property tax .
there is no farm@@ ers there today no farm@@ ers more - but small gard@@ en@@ ers in the sun . &quot;
a large green surface is located north of the sub@@ m@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , in the 19th century , the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , was in the 19th century , there was a me@@ adow and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map shows a sight into history of p@@ sychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the ur@@ reserve sheet you read in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen in the area of &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; operation . &quot;
Yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one was once more people with gu@@ ahn@@ vor@@ s .

citi@@ zen Group publ@@ ishes Travel Guide for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for promotion of colored people issued a warning for colored people , based on dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ing policy and the r@@ assi@@ st@@ ical attacks of the state after Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should come into force on 28 August 2017 , due to the state special attention , as a number of frag@@ ments , r@@ usion @-@ based processes , in recent period in the entire state and here , it is noted in the position of the group .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , that it is he@@ avier to gain , dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ing authorities , as well as the prosec@@ ution of the state that had und@@ isp@@ ut@@ able to min@@ ority interests , the NA@@ AC@@ P said in NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have inj@@ uries of the civil rights that happen people .
they are led because of their skin , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; we hear the compl@@ aints in such frequency , which we have not heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group acc@@ id@@ ents as r@@ assi@@ st@@ ical persec@@ ution against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory Sand@@ ers , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
Sand@@ ers died at the beginning of the year , after having had no more fuel in the journey through the state of no petrol , and caused by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime .
the Council also shows a recent report from the Office of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people may con@@ sci@@ ous and their families , friends and staff about it , what would happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the people must be prepared if there is K@@ auti@@ full , or related to the rel@@ atives to travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i were recorded in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ om@@ iting , according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ an interru@@ pted review of F@@ BI the state in relation to the number of such inj@@ uries on the 16th in the country .
the trip is also a answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Act that would be more difficult to be a company because of living or employment dis@@ cri@@ mination .
previously , the American Ci@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) were issued for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted the local pen@@ al authorities to f@@ aul@@ ted people due to immig@@ rants , which contri@@ bute to view to the AC@@ LU for further rank@@ ings .
travel grant are usually issued by the Ministry for Other Coun@@ tries , but in the last time , Inter@@ est groups have been used as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Weimar project is el@@ ement@@ ar
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ ord@@ erly Peter White and Cord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have a picture to the place .
at the Sch@@ wend@@ emann , the Sch@@ wend@@ emann met the representative of Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U local district together with may@@ or Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Sch@@ wend@@ emann granted first in@@ sights into his operation , in which he accommod@@ ated 55 hectares of me@@ adows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 mil@@ k@@ ite and as many vir@@ uses supplies and five apartments holiday houses .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch is for him of the alternative mark@@ ings for the milk of his c@@ ows , so Sch@@ wend@@ emann .
on the table of the residence is exclusively govern@@ mental .
since he also received BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ er@@ bach , he called Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ us as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar . &quot;
I can &apos;t work on the art @-@ art surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work , much more shots can be processed with the motor tri@@ mmer .
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; st@@ ressed Sch@@ wend@@ emann .
in 2003 he acquired the el@@ abor@@ ative operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and d@@ unes , even if he has no organic operations .
for the may@@ or of Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the comm@@ une has recognized the signific@@ ance of the wil@@ low project management and is gl@@ ad about the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , the farm@@ ers are supported .
you hope that the coll@@ ap@@ oration of the surfaces might be down even a whole while .
&quot; the largest treasure we have , they are people who work in agriculture , and thought about how they go on their operation , &quot; the may@@ or of the may@@ or .
the farm@@ ers are often found in crit@@ ic@@ ism in the crit@@ ic@@ ism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in the year 2013 .
the re@@ tention surface area of 40 hectares , which will not be increased to at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the Leader is f@@ unded , a quarter took the municipality of Fisch@@ er@@ bach .
therefore we spent the farm@@ ers 12 610 Euros which had to inv@@ est in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , declared Sch@@ wend@@ emann .
Kord@@ ula Kov@@ ac bet@@ onte : &quot; you makes a really good job , without farm@@ ers and landing .
also for Peter white stand : &quot; here the best food are produced . &quot;
the State Library line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of soft@@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the open position of the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR direc@@ tories .
in addition , the f@@ enced area is not drag @-@ positi@@ oned ( slope over 35 percent ) and must be thre@@ at@@ ened by the coll@@ ap@@ oration .
as a result of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence with 24 plots , which would like to build a lot of 16 kilometres .
the re@@ tention surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the first character of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ ach the stat@@ ues .
the Americ@@ ans have likewise like any other - and therefore the car@@ eful crash of Sad@@ dam H@@ uss@@ an came on the Fir@@ m in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ists of Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did , as he did a symbo@@ lic sp@@ reading with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N regarding the suggest@@ ions to dra@@ stic limitation of leg@@ ally immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not stay the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators had taught him when he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular importance to have been attri@@ buted to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta deci@@ de : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to the later , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is s@@ ach@@ able properly , but as he form@@ ulated it , it is not really around history .
it goes around the contemporary res@@ on@@ ance of the words of Lazarus , the only in which a state does not include any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your effort to bre@@ eds your poor , and the poor out of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time to see in the &quot; el@@ abor@@ tion &quot; on our screens .
Miller cl@@ ag@@ ates not in the Liter@@ ary crit@@ ic@@ ism - it was clearly that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the signific@@ ance of a statue is part of a wider policy and cultural explo@@ itation : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends that se@@ emed to place their words after her death , and knew very good that they had a highly political hand .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and Americ@@ an@@ Republi@@ can demonstr@@ ates the female dis@@ per@@ sion of liber@@ al dis@@ per@@ ation of freedom .
Lazarus changed this signific@@ ance : in her po@@ em , the female figure no longer ab@@ str@@ act - it has a voice .
and she gives itself another name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ ems with the picture is a brilliant f@@ emin@@ ist Cou@@ p and an att@@ acking attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and as Lazarus changed the signific@@ ance of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the Great Schrei@@ h@@ as R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , arg@@ um@@ entation 2010 that the Statue of Liberty didn &apos;t have an early Ne@@ oc@@ ative , but rather trans@@ formed the American flame in the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is to wear the f@@ ack@@ le of the United States in the rest of the world .
the f@@ ack@@ le should not drop the way into the United States . &quot;
quite un@@ usually , Lim@@ bau@@ gh click here to a little bit .
the signific@@ ance of the statue is quite and even a question of ra@@ ising perc@@ eption .
the great imag@@ in@@ ative act of Lazarus consi@@ sted of Lazarus out to see how they had seen by the ex@@ hau@@ sted , but ho@@ ping people after long and often aw@@ es@@ ome travel on the Deck@@ s of Shi@@ ps .
it is in true sense , to see the world from persp@@ ective of people who seek ref@@ uge and a chance to improve your life .
your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they hear .
and that is of course not the persp@@ ective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump could not recogni@@ ze .
your f@@ ack@@ le is not the way to shine , but the hat@@ red , which is the only source of power is not ign@@ ited .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ans Sc@@ ott@@ ish members of the teams of Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when two sh@@ all@@ ots to the team of Great Britain .
the Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member of the Sc@@ ott@@ ish Kon@@ t@@ ing@@ ent in the world championship &quot; a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Sc@@ ott@@ ish Ath@@ l@@ eten was selected for London 2017 , which starts to Friday .
black believed that &quot; would have been a little species in Scotland &quot; and the &quot; Athletics of the United Kingdom &apos;s something has to learn .
&quot; we welcome you , and we are trying to understand , and we will find it , until we &apos;ll need to figure out what Black .
&quot; I say to people at Sc@@ ott@@ ish Institute of Sport and they think that there was something to do with him what they have done .
the Sc@@ ott@@ ish Ath@@ l@@ eten thought that it was something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it did something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type of road corner .
what is always the combination of circum@@ st@@ ances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Sc@@ ott@@ ish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals back@@ ward , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - the way against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team of the team cap@@ tain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite mod@@ est .
their chapters was un@@ believ@@ able , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of Ath@@ l@@ eten , no matter whether they live or exercise , wal@@ ked out of the room and felt very proud and were very mot@@ iv@@ ated .
the passion and true feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h made entirely of course , great was great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal , which will comp@@ ete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; Im@@ possibly &quot; is that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the brit@@ ish team .
the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mu@@ ir Central Bank Mu@@ ir leads to this path , and has been installed in five British and two European records .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run@@ ners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Sch@@ otte , one of a great season to ob@@ serve the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of their first world championships as the only other sh@@ ol@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
in fact , it says that &quot; enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly pro@@ ud@@ ly pro@@ ud@@ ly &quot; to the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men not only belong to the team , but in some cases even at the medals and in the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special team cap@@ tain has been in fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour for me , but I have chosen me to make me something special for me , &quot; added it to something . &quot;
&quot; ob@@ viously , I &apos;m very proud of all the be@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows just how far we come .
and they are as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podium .
what my speech is concern@@ ed ?
Yes , I think she went well .
I have only missed that we have very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to place this home support and benefit to benefit that we are back in the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there , and comp@@ eting it , and it will be simply as a great atmosphere since it was without . &quot;
blocks from crit@@ ics on Facebook : maint@@ ains not to bear a public office when you can &apos;t bear the heat of sor@@ ties .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americ@@ ans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers took him because of the inner policy until his political principles .
he sch@@ im@@ ited with crit@@ ic@@ ism , safe .
but he did not brought his crit@@ ics to sw@@ iss .
for the year 1783 , Washington said : &quot; the def@@ ective quality can be taken away - and , du@@ ck and silent , we are led as the sheep for the batt@@ les . &quot;
this brings me to Mar@@ yland to Gou@@ ver@@ neu@@ r Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who have to work more as Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans people saw the contributions from at least 450 persons and deleted its opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Ci@@ vil Liber@@ ties Union missed him due to the beginning of this week .
the stick of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs therefore dis@@ missed the compl@@ aint as fri@@ ction , and the online comment was fully equipped with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in a over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming democ@@ ratic state , who is amazing .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the Nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary h@@ itz@@ head .
he has a fixed hand at the lead of his state and close appro@@ aches of principles .
he was also sent to use Facebook as primary funds to use with its vot@@ ers and play@@ ful head to chemotherapy on its side .
so , the block@@ age of persons who come to the site of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs - which is an public forum , which is officially design@@ ated and of employees that are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessary and ulti@@ mat@@ ely dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended H@@ og@@ ans Ob@@ tain Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of govern@@ ed and arg@@ uments that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or chambers or rig@@ ht@@ ly filled people , which is low in order online .
the post office said with some of the most effective people who have been blo@@ cked from H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen driver : a teacher , an entre@@ pren@@ eurs and a priest , no dri@@ f@@ ake .
they all told , that their comments is resp@@ ectable and not benef@@ ic@@ ing .
the Bible published the Bible in his post and app@@ elling at H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
att@@ or@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bow@@ ie , M@@ d . , was not toug@@ h , but it asked to Hass@@ om@@ iting .
&quot; I comm@@ erci@@ ful that I was dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ om@@ iting and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the comment field of the news &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I estimate this idea when a number of people taking place on the same subject , then they are used by man@@ ages more than a so much coll@@ ecting dep@@ loyment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the people of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs as &quot; concentr@@ ated sp@@ am attack &quot; is called other probably &quot; prin@@ ce &quot; .
the Facebook era makes it easy to install a message to blocks a cr@@ itic block or a negative comment .
it &apos;s much clean when in former time if you have done the same thing that employees were ab@@ sent to collect newspapers by critical objective and demonstr@@ ators to burn newspapers and demonstr@@ ators .
but this is just a digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants that he is critical to Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is rep@@ aired by Twitter oper@@ ators who have been blo@@ cked from his Twitter Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the ch@@ airman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the first Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District , James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she was recognized a vot@@ ers of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gou@@ ver@@ neu@@ r Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit by the AC@@ LU for its use by Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Wash@@ ing@@ ton the time of a similar p@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers ab@@ and@@ oned between 1776 and 1800 , and an@@ on@@ ymous let@@ es on his leadership .
and even it had Washington an@@ on@@ ym@@ es in Washington .
the people who made the ps@@ eu@@ don@@ ym@@ es such as &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that did ser@@ vic@@ ing dec@@ isions .
Pet@@ itions , which invol@@ ving its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not brought them to sw@@ iss .
reproduction , differences of differences and dis@@ courses are among the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that .

on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children without and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indian soldiers onto a motorbike through the darkness .
the ro@@ cking children said them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone , and later returned to four soldiers , the local priest Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
soldiers who had dr@@ unk , young , and sle@@ pt the group with their p@@ enn@@ ant , said victims and witnesses .
then hum@@ idi@@ fied one of the soldiers in the group of children .
a child who fell by a 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavy that he fell into a com@@ a .
a few hours later the building was set by the nearby government Commission in fire and the things be calibr@@ ated on the next day .
about 1.000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Commander to claim justice .
they were cer@@ em@@ oni@@ fac@@ ial hunting ar@@ ches and led the orph@@ ans dance - in the circle and a bird &apos;s im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started stones in police and military sign@@ posts .
when the m@@ ood was heated , the soldiers have been sent over a internal radio : &quot; when the mass@@ es were sent over three times more than three times , they shoot them at a official document of TIME that has not been released in a official document .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked after peace and called to peace and called the amount to , at home .
No one was list@@ ening in the m@@ ood .
&quot; when I was turned in my left hand , I was shot in my left hand , he said , at the veranda of his coloured wooden hospital .
Kay@@ ame knows still not , who gre@@ ts , but say that the bul@@ let out of the rows were gathered together for soldiers .
&quot; it was f@@ ills , many shots were fired , and added to it .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his co@@ usin , the witness of the er@@ ror@@ ism .
&quot; I ran@@ ged him and att@@ empt@@ ed to pass his body , to make sure that he was , said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries a name , he said , he said , The TIME is in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er atmosphere .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I saw him . &quot;
the Ch@@ ef@@ insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said re@@ por@@ ters that his Offic@@ ers will only be &quot; secure , because they are att@@ acked .
&quot; we must def@@ end us when people dro@@ ught to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Comm@@ issi@@ oner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is going to life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more inj@@ ured .
the news about the k@@ illing took place on the following day &apos; filtered by Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passi@@ onate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for families of victims of victims and pregn@@ ant to go to historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I would like that this case is immediate , so that it will not happen anymore in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he had a foreign mechan@@ is@@ diction for the supplement of human rights viol@@ ations .
but the prosp@@ ects began almost immediately .
&quot; most inj@@ uries have occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 @-@ ers and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er .
the point is that we have oblig@@ ed to go to this con@@ tra , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wir@@ anto did a return , when he spoke on 5th June in Jak@@ arta with TIME he said , He did not have any plans to judge a compl@@ aint mechanism .
instead , it is underst@@ ood everything . &quot; he said . &quot;
Wir@@ anto by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; was charged with more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai procedure .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such conf@@ leg@@ ations with gri@@ s un@@ beli@@ e@@ vers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that he lives still in an@@ xi@@ ety years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; says he .
&quot; I am afraid of the army to be afraid of the military . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us rep@@ aired the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the inc@@ ident .
he says that he was defe@@ ated from the military after he helped him to buried four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried in the army , he att@@ empt@@ ed to me , &quot; says he .
the shooting does not have heard .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police arrested in the village of Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between village inhabitants and the Manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who ref@@ used to bring a con@@ sci@@ ous man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were inj@@ ured , including children .
the man who dr@@ unk 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk in a close river and died on the way to the hospital .
the village of village occupied prot@@ esters before the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the village lived stones for officers , which re@@ acted it by warning .
but domestic say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary Police ) began to shoot the quantity and killed an k@@ illing .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we &apos;ve got rid of ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the close to the hospital , and witness was as fast as the last here .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai par@@ liament called to pull the participating officers to the mathemati@@ cs and the mobile brig@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trou@@ bled for the Indian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strength@@ ens the un@@ satis@@ faction of the tri@@ cks , Mon@@ i , D@@ ani and Dam@@ al that live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many p@@ oured out the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , who claims to def@@ end the ordin@@ ation of the Pap@@ ua Act , caus@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ ans attacks and demonstr@@ ations from ind@@ on@@ ese soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guide comes from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
as response , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary in custody by the prec@@ urs@@ hip of &quot; securing the national so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ity in the past few years . &quot;
some diving will never be back .
under the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a trag@@ ic , for@@ g@@ otten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satis@@ faction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is for loc@@ als too expensive .
bread is the same as a range .
the people build here everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ lets .
agriculture is the task of women that can work four or five fields of sweet potato .
keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest will be sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the period of time , economic dis@@ orders between the native Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rants have grown since the opening of new aircraft at Nab@@ ire in greater number since .
the few jobs that are in the region , usually come to the better trained and prosp@@ erous mig@@ rants .
Pap@@ ua have rarely the capital or the necessary cap@@ abilities to perform their own company compet@@ itive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Ch@@ air@@ person of the Chief Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
Isol@@ ation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , Restric@@ tions of the reporting of international media will remain open .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Longchamp were dep@@ orted due to lack of coordination with emig@@ rants from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Dep@@ uty Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election to raise the lim@@ itations of reporting to promote transpar@@ ency and development .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists who are trying to report of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ refin@@ ed provinc@@ es of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : Visa ref@@ und and a black list , &quot; told in a statement .
m@@ angel@@ n@@ de press brief@@ ly means that the international print on the Indones@@ ian government remains limited to the immediate neigh@@ b@@ ors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ onga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and wides@@ pre@@ ad inj@@ uries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
the n@@ arr@@ ator of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir were still a democ@@ ratic system , and there are free media , so it &apos;s free media , so that it is difficult to feel the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people want to take place that more foreign govern@@ ments will take this to knowledge .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Rights , Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited her silence , and thre@@ at@@ ened him &quot; We want to participate in compliance with a source that participated in the session , but an@@ on@@ ymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia has a further presid@@ ential election , but the Pap@@ ua will tell you to vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man that has good prosp@@ ects , but he is surrounded by people that are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Ch@@ air@@ woman of the Chief Executive Board .
he wants to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people saw that the Pan@@ i@@ ai nation , that it is living under the constant thre@@ at of a r@@ äu@@ ber@@ ian military lives in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people says like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt , &quot; which he must pay .
&quot; it is no money , they want to do to righteousness , &quot; says he .
despite the drugs , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ani carried out a last symbo@@ lic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ ist : the bodies of a victims was buried at a grounds to the police and military station .
you know that of them may never come to righteousness , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a healthy head .
&quot; what can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place in Dubai on Friday in one of the highest living @-@ towers of the world in Dubai , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that f@@ ail in only two years , that is notic@@ eable to the tor@@ ch @-@ tower ( fig @-@ tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , inj@@ uries have been reported , and there were no directional word concerning the cause of fl@@ ames .
&quot; we have tast@@ ed and we have st@@ acked with the fire alarm and c@@ rying out of the people .
we ran@@ ged the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told you a resident than George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais Ci@@ vil authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the buildings .
the government told they work on the provision for the person concern@@ ed .
the inc@@ ident , questions can be used to safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high homes on all over the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building according to its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the lining for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , they believe that the system of the plates for ins@@ ulating and covering at the London Gren@@ ade Tower in June to the rapid spread of a Brand@@ es could have died , which died about 80 people died .
No Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the session in Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h City , the revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winning stre@@ ams , ho@@ ok@@ es are not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also this is therefore very estimated five @-@ set classi@@ cs to the traditi@@ ons .
the Member of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ert@@ y was therefore just missed by the Member of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ert@@ y .
&quot; we charge this decision but are dis@@ appointed that our membership does not have received the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long term of this ic@@ onic and historic compet@@ itions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ert@@ y .
one will still work to improve the application .
not only for the vote was come after many entries already before the proposal , the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will present in the first round of the hosts in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ ers , the requirements will be fac@@ ilit@@ ated and players are fac@@ ilit@@ ated before Davis Cup less official media event .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travel@@ ers to forbidden items into the aircraft , a survey is out
a survey conducted under air@@ pass resulted in that more than 20 percent con@@ sci@@ ous or un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous altern@@ atives to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which ra@@ ises the air@@ plane , while they acc@@ ident@@ ally combine knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they were del@@ ayed by del@@ ayed them with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ sts .
the survey conducted over 1,000 people - which was performed by a Jet @-@ Charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out , that younger travel@@ ers were ab@@ used for the rules .
of the respond@@ ents that they were att@@ empt@@ ed to fly with anything , which was b@@ anned by T@@ SA , was 19.@@ 7 percent of Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of generation X were .
the most common items that were ab@@ orted to T@@ SA agents in T@@ SA , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave thanks to the security control with the security control , while 2.2 per cent of female patients and 3.7 percent of the male respond@@ ents were den@@ ied that they were ab@@ sent ab@@ sent into the aircraft .
the company said , there were travel@@ ed to all the country in all country to find out how many acc@@ ident@@ ally acc@@ ident@@ ally resulted in the airport security and how many things have done it .
there is no surprise that people who want to bear the most important sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ es - w@@ iss@@ or or un@@ w@@ iss@@ ally - through the security , those who fly the most common .
however , the company shows that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives could be comp@@ lic@@ ated and conf@@ usion .
people are often ir@@ able to take up flu@@ ids , or as much of them .
so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA was measured diag@@ rams .
a time for long , the T@@ SA could see books as dirt .
liquids are admitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : several thousand of Tes@@ la customers .
E @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has und@@ erg@@ one part of the customers its un@@ binding reservation already back again .
in addition to the always tri@@ um@@ ph@@ al numbers , Tes@@ la b@@ oss El@@ on Mus@@ k has received a different , less expensive numbers for the first time : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had more frequently used in the past few months with more than 500,000 predec@@ ess@@ ments for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition is straight .
now , Mus@@ k is a : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 demonstr@@ ations have been re@@ trac@@ ted again 63@@ .000 .
cr@@ itic had always ab@@ and@@ oned again that it is only valid for a binding reservations .
for cancell@@ ations charged Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking deposit is fully re@@ charged .
currently e@@ ats 45@@ 5,000 such in@@ binding reservations , sp@@ ati@@ al Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
so that the cancellation of date are about twelve percent of all orders for problem , the Tes@@ la b@@ oss could not believe .
his arg@@ ument : the challenge in the ambiti@@ ous growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
the Tes@@ la 84@@ .000 vehicles were delivered in the past year .
for 2018 - all models will be climbed - 500.000 , 2020 will be one million .
demand for this is ob@@ viously because .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
if you can order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; for the first half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la it creates , its brand new , never makes its nails without any major interru@@ ptions with maximum load capacity .
many experts dou@@ bt that this is possible .
but it comes to larger di@@ vers , then the dis@@ ability of reservations may be Tes@@ la for Tes@@ la .
because then the company can not be un@@ satisfied customers not to be able to adm@@ ire in treas@@ ures .

P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as its agency , according to the requirements of the state Environmental authorities and re@@ ferred to re@@ act faster than existing administration .
he mentioned the compl@@ aint against his previous job at a Federal Court of App@@ eal in the Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is going to hold deadline October 1st for states to hold the standards of the@@ ft o@@ zone by the 2015 standards for the bod@@ y@@ tic O@@ zone .

the su@@ dden return on Wednesday is the youngest legal feedback for the reti@@ rement roll@@ back agenda .
last month a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA ref@@ ill has exceeded its authority as a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitoring and reduction of meth@@ anl@@ ecks , to be consum@@ ed .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt revealed that his swe@@ eping at o@@ zone standards quite simply the read@@ iness of the EPA to cooperation with the countries through the complex process of the new standards .
&quot; under former administration , the EPA often won &apos;t keep the dead@@ lines for the implementation , and then to be charged , and in a agreement for the implementation of implementation , P@@ ru@@ itt , the EPA more than a do@@ zen times in its previous job .
&quot; we believe not on a regul@@ ating by court method , and we take Fri@@ sten .
we also take the law and authority which gives us to us . &quot;

the US president sei@@ zed him because he had publi@@ cl@@ y in the wall , because he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t say to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mo@@ ore Ford mass@@ acre : acti@@ vi@@ sts exec@@ ute r@@ assi@@ st@@ ical Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for righteousness again .
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , four black passengers and a white rider had reached the bridge , a group of white men came to block his way to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle @-@ stri@@ ped one took a long train to its c@@ ig@@ ars and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside the ins@@ ect in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; low@@ ing the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l it out of the car ! &quot;
aw@@ es@@ ome z@@ err@@ orn the silence , when a young black man was drawn from passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ es@@ ome scene that was played on July 22nd , only a desc@@ ending position .
but if a sh@@ ould@@ ers will be thro@@ wn by the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; with almost all in the audience very genuine Se@@ uf@@ zer .
since 2005 he entered the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to visit the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux K@@ LAN in 1946 .
No one was charged ever because of the Mor@@ de .
&quot; it is really amazing that in all these years were no only one person . although we know in our con@@ greg@@ ations , although we know , who they are , said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization of the position .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life in C@@ iti@@ zens@@ hip .
for him , the dis@@ position as a dram@@ atic call to Action , and represents an annual re@@ membr@@ ance of the Monroe community that has never been correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want to tr@@ acking the prosec@@ ution , we want to he@@ aling , we want to re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation , but first must we get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to he@@ aling and re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation until we get righteousness . &quot;
a ju@@ ster @-@ owner puts a beg@@ gar on the bodies of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county was destroyed in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was charged ever .
even though the susp@@ ects have been staying for decades that the citi@@ zens@@ hip for decades that the double mot@@ iv@@ ation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always known : polit@@ ics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court rendered to the black citizens in Georgia to take the first time in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ach to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a strug@@ gle for a woman .
Bro@@ oks told , the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester started with Mal@@ com@@ s Ms. Dor@@ othy lo@@ l@@ af@@ en and that the baby they came from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a pro@@ min@@ ent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free from the prison , the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Co@@ us@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she went away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge is surrounded by car , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b car .
&quot; as it was out , Har@@ rison , who prepared the mor@@ de , which has prepared the mor@@ row , and includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; it is also ob@@ vious that there was a si@@ ze@@ al between the state and local criminal off@@ ences , which was not only involved in the Mor@@ den , the evidence elim@@ inated and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more pre@@ gn@@ ome .
&quot; it was a voting right @-@ mass@@ acre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were killed all in order to send me a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then it will happen to you here . &quot;
in the decade , Cass@@ andra has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de in Cass@@ andra .
your representation is illustr@@ ating and is just@@ ified in a kind of de@@ ep@@ rac@@ ism , because of many believe that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to cut and still difficult to go , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; we do not want to speak about the Lyn@@ ch because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with him in us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can build any relationship with you if you want to listen to me or hear what I made it . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actor - a do@@ zen wh@@ ites and the rest Black - in a room and list@@ ening to an excellent view over the pieces .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ eting Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief of the chief of Cl@@ an@@ mi@@ eds , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I cry me , because I am not so am , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story at life because we would not return to this times . &quot;
on the other side of the space proven the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , which play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester to play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and supp@@ or@@ ated it , that he has served with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , p@@ oned from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona pra@@ ises the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the highest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ leg@@ ed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; No , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still back@@ ed .
&quot; I believe that white people were at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but , swe@@ at one of the other black actors .
&quot; you need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and as they move the energy in space , a feeling of the camera shaft , the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is now working , this is correct but because of the game , but also due to the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts at once again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it , and with re@@ print .
absolutely no@@ body laugh@@ s .
this rep@@ etition is s@@ alt@@ ed and fast .
there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman , who cloth@@ ed with a gr@@ ape dress , is about the body of actors and leads tr@@ ace holidays li@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks at every second Word .
approximately one hundred metres of you know a group of about four do@@ zen gr@@ abs and te@@ ars from the eyes .
the audience is nearly equal between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , en@@ e@@ ist to see the performance , many will only come down the road .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Georgia , when Bro@@ oks became a pilgri@@ m@@ age to the tom@@ b of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de have remained a st@@ ek@@ d@@ ote , but now if you took place on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , fe@@ els the air .
if the last notes of the songs , Gre@@ ene inv@@ ites the quantity to come and to insp@@ ecting the body name .
children ho@@ cken on their heads , to sign the f@@ ake blood and feeding the body and wh@@ is@@ ers at each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ dered a little boy when he re@@ mem@@ bered as a we@@ ep .
after some minutes the Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly there is over .
the actor throw the Lyn@@ x@@ eil road and we@@ gian their te@@ ars .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ arm@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , who played the man who played the Cl@@ an board .
Nick Ras@@ cona ren@@ amed two of his co player and breaks out in their poor , the em@@ oti@@ onal load of the performance breaks finally caused by him .
&quot; it is ok@@ ay , &quot; wh@@ is@@ per@@ ish one of the women .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done this reason . &quot;
later , the audience with the act@@ ites for dinner together .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta exc@@ ited over the dis@@ position with a black pair , which they just like to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski f@@ ought to find words to find words that over@@ come the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terri@@ ble words and de@@ eds to hear ... of people how you look like yourself and that do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what you really do with me , do I believe that the Lyn@@ x is still more , &quot; added it , &quot; today , the only police shooting is called . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof on his table , he is@@ st and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said , he had already started to start the performance in the next year .
&quot; the dis@@ position is inspired by a way , because she describes the ter@@ ror of what we have , but there is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we learn to learn it , then it can happen again .
who does not have his own story , who does not know his own story , to repeat them . &quot;

the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his head team .
in 2013 he had to pass a g@@ ellen@@ des pipes over themselves , there were five years later , in which the beg@@ otten &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; was lower .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have taken over it .
&quot; it is noted that the audience has grown to the &quot; Ring &quot; in certain manner , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience was not only a form of peace with Cast@@ les , but it is also a understanding of vision for its vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max Quantity works as a volunte@@ er
they work in its volunte@@ ers year on several sites .
where everywhere ?
amount : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture industry , once a week hel@@ ping here in the furniture bridge in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked in an open day at school .
how are your experiences ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years so a late volunte@@ er volunte@@ ers .
how does it mean ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineering , say we were successfully broken .
I &apos;ve been known for me that it &apos;s for me , and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked me , what do you need .
Make a soci@@ alist year , since there is an in@@ sight , as it can see , as it is in burning , perhaps really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .

one has always pre@@ domin@@ antly found other people who have a very other history .
whether a refuge@@ e , whether a youth who has been over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed from the family - one must always be gone .
very interesting .
and they had no more contact ?
quantity : for that I am not the type .
it is a range that gives a lot .
much love , lots of friend@@ liness .
there are also negative mom@@ ents , but so is that life .

the US American Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to det@@ ained the government of Obama , w@@ on@@ ach the states are oblig@@ ed to destroy the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states the agency because of the stri@@ de of stri@@ pe .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday , the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone defin@@ itions in 2015 &quot; said they said , Show the oblig@@ ation of the agency , with States .

a group of 15 mostly democ@@ ratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed on Tuesday , and said that the efforts of il@@ leg@@ ally .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to rest@@ ore a wide range of environmental guidelines , which has been raised by the former President Bar@@ ack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which should be back to Tr@@ ump on economic growth .
however , the efforts have made the back of the Democrats and nature protection groups who make care about the effects of greater emissions to public health .

Municipal counc@@ ill@@ at wants to commun@@ al space
at the end the decision was clearly : in case of two parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln appro@@ ves the establishment of a community in the future sen@@ iors .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still is missing , declared by Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still last until the church belonged to the Church Office , but there is no plans for a private invest@@ or to st@@ em@@ ingly project .
there is a discussion on a joint space .
one of the two invest@@ ors , which are still in the boat , offered the assembly .
on the ground floor , he would have a living space - about 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with some 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council we@@ ak@@ ened such a joint space not as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ite residence , but open to the church .
as an example made the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; in turn .
if the decision is made by the provision for the running budget , which was decided in the past autumn , by funding options .
the construction is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a commun@@ al har@@ ms would be , as reported as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the resolutions passed to sign@@ posted the invest@@ or to sign@@ aling him in this regard , that your seat is to be po@@ inted out that both arti@@ c - what is reduced to the environments - what the tr@@ ace height is reduced and the construction sector - all of you would be possible .
not necessary , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously the Gre@@ mium .
not so simple is the common room .
Daniela call refers to the many own building , with which one is going to come so that Leh@@ ne is now at the commun@@ al area of the window , says : &quot; I do so difficult to do so . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks for the community room - but absolutely against a municipal invol@@ vement .
it looks behind a hidden payout to ohn@@ eh@@ in , or even on Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area there is no sub@@ sid@@ y , but get a real , in dou@@ bt , the counter@@ part is the counter@@ title .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers Re@@ qu@@ est for the decision to con@@ fin@@ als , will be three fe@@ ared .
for example , in two counter@@ part in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller is now together : &quot; If we take the decision to close the decision to close a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ ch@@ orch@@ ain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ pes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er to Braunschweig , that the optimi@@ zation of def@@ ensive positioning into Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season of Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , that there were not the two contr@@ ary at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two mut@@ ore too much , and we must be better to fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ geb@@ irge Mountains shall also be further optim@@ ised .
and a gate after a free fall , the Fort@@ une will do not want to do anymore .
&quot; for the future , there is no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinc@@ ed that his team is even better after the experience in preparation with the Tri@@ ch@@ orch@@ ain for better than with the four @-@ pl@@ ets .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what we will have to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is in the Thir@@ ty to the sem@@ icon@@ ductor positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ink@@ elmann players who can build well , said Hoffmann .
&quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but that we are better harmon@@ ics and we are not to set up as many dis@@ playing error . &quot;
of course also Hoffmann moved to Au@@ e to win the game .
but if you have decided to meet the start of a miss@@ able start , do not know .
the power might be ok@@ ay by ok@@ ay , &quot; the Hoffmann began .
&quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk at a ordinary season open@@ er . &quot;
of which his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season , I only would like to speak after six to eight gam@@ ers , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of a benefit against Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim was coll@@ aps@@ ed because of an un@@ expected age .
&quot; now they can start the season qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ y and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fresh , since they have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climbing time in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the Interior of Fort@@ una .
the guests arriving from the Rhin@@ eland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the meeting in finally ( almost ) fer@@ ous stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we have f@@ akes , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sin@@ n , &quot; says Funk@@ y , whose balance is out of only a defe@@ at against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you need to strike by suggest@@ ion , &quot; explains Fort@@ une Ch@@ ef@@ coach .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant and survi@@ ve . &quot;
and then I want to experience his player on Sunday at any time .
new results of the Swedish As@@ yl@@ age evaluation tests are published
the youngest results of tests for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subj@@ ected to medical assessment of their age , that more than 80 per cent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believed to the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Government for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( Rät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal ) has started the test of tests last year .
they should make the estim@@ ation of the age for as@@ yl@@ um , after the Swedish mig@@ ration authority ( mig@@ rat@@ ory ab@@ normal@@ ities ) because of the fail@@ ure of corru@@ pt refugees were critical , the decrease of age .
until today , mig@@ rat@@ um has sent 6,@@ 880 to test@@ ing cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency now announced the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31st July 2017 .
eight percent ( 2002 ) were jud@@ ged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency suggested that the person may not be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is put in question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past months .
&quot; we see any big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; told the journal The Local .
the high percentage of cases reported in which the person has been jud@@ ged over 18 years , does not necess@@ arily that the as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers have lived .
in May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases , which means that the subject to att@@ empt@@ ed person 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ blad@@ et the 581 appeared to investig@@ ated them that in 243 of these cases the person had open that they may be 18 years old .
the method of medical investigation con@@ vic@@ tories in excess of te@@ ars and M@@ RT recordings of kne@@ es will be analyzed , which are analyzed by d@@ enti@@ ve and radi@@ olog@@ ists who were critical in some areas .
a Sk@@ ep@@ tics of Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work carried out the assessment of biological matur@@ ity of hum@@ ans to see it or later than usually by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to give it , and I believe not that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way , is very un@@ safe .
if we cannot tell it , we should do not so as if we could do it , he said to the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you may say that the risk of an adult is impossible to split an adult .
the largest risk is in this case when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg will come well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton stra@@ ight@@ forward was installed on the eastern part of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the east side .
&quot; we are very good in the time , it runs great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , building leader in the department of road and traffic in the Regional Planning Freiburg .
in April , the work started at all three s@@ ani@@ zing bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is covered with a red cra@@ b stone and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
built in 1900 it was built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges , she has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and transport safety , the three buildings are tho@@ roughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the out@@ sk@@ irts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1,30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge folder on Wednesday morning .
this is a longitudinal section that is used as an operating range .
the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2,20 meter width of bridge .
then the pe@@ de@@ strian path is then lost .
the particular is that it deals with manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are equipped with the pat@@ ented bridges .
special f@@ inger@@ bread feel the processing of lines due to the construction plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre optic , which is connected to many firms .
the attend@@ ance was informed in the field of work by hand sign@@ board over the prec@@ eding .
furthermore , fish had to be cau@@ ght fish and canc@@ el .
for the bridges between the building structure and the collectors drive in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic sp@@ uri@@ g is controlled by a traffic light .
the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at a height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; fully locked .
the cost of the three bridges are 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financ@@ ed by the country .

agriculture in an interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ fts , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about Shipping eggs .
how could you pass the Sk@@ and@@ al ?
how can protect consumers .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the ed@@ it@@ orial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can I protect the consumers before ?
I can only accept all consumer use and consumers to check eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp .
on the consumer protection of www.@@ od@@ war@@ n@@ od@@ .de , the states will introduce the last information on the affected eggs batch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know , if we know , a health haz@@ ard is prac@@ tically excl@@ uded .
takes over Al@@ di the best possible scrat@@ ch reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance minister is not really true ?
the food monitoring is the task of the provinc@@ es .
despite my house , my house has und@@ il@@ legal and is located since conf@@ identi@@ ality of Germany in tight exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the Trading has the same as the manufacturer to carry care that the sold products are traffic and health .
when with eggs , the number of withdraw@@ al content of 0.@@ 005@@ mg / kg are exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consum@@ ed .
for this time not the establ@@ ish@@ ments are f@@ ault .
sit production equipment and consumers in the same boat ?
after the tim@@ eless code sur@@ passes the production facilities have no immediate debt .
rather , they must expect to mut@@ il@@ legal intern@@ ships by mut@@ il@@ legal intern@@ ships of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is in the har@@ ness too little contro@@ l@@ ure .
is missing there just a staff or even on the closing arg@@ uments ?
there were just the official controls which have covered the process .
however , the food was also heard that food was never able to be 100 percent excl@@ uded .
just des@@ p@@ its are a consi@@ stent re@@ conn@@ aissance of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ution in the cases where can be dec@@ is@@ ive signific@@ ance of dec@@ is@@ ive signific@@ ance .
I &apos;ve made a lot of several times that I checked out by the responsible authorities of a l@@ um@@ er@@ less re@@ conn@@ aissance .
is the regular alarm is really necessary for food additi@@ ves ?
the consumer society and consumers have the right to get secure and traffic foods .
if a non @-@ auth@@ orized ins@@ ec@@ tic@@ ide in the food industry , are consumer society and consumers .
by the controlled funds are manufacturer , distribut@@ ors and consumers in a situation which is not necessary .
bas@@ ically it must be clear : the right hand @-@ dri@@ ft dep@@ loyment of the ins@@ ec@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ life @-@ animals is not h@@ inn@@ ed and must be un@@ favour@@ able .
on all levels , sequ@@ ent and working with high print .
I expect of all the compet@@ ent authorities , that of the t@@ angible and l@@ um@@ bs are ex@@ cl@@ ari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of the Foot Ball to Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris in Paris
the rules that prevent sh@@ ri@@ mps , un@@ covered spending by the European soccer field , Ne@@ ym@@ ars Pu@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain not st@@ ar .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain von der UEFA EURO , for the introduc@@ tory organisation that the European game has survi@@ ved power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair play rules , which have been called by the UEFA ins in 2011 , mean that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has to be financ@@ ed without major losses .
Barcelona has 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian regions of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a sal@@ ary for several ten million dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars to France .
with security , the money is done with security , thus the Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been writing and bring him into a galax@@ y of other Stars , because of the financing of the teams through the energy rich rul@@ ing family of Qatar .
Ver@@ ily may apply for the acquisition of players much money , but with leg@@ it@@ im@@ en entry sources , which enable the Break @-@ E@@ ven point in their on football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini to his election to the UEFA Presid@@ ents in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ ben@@ ds who had to success in its route according to success , effectively gl@@ ad@@ vent@@ ed and risk to ru@@ ined if banks or owner their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P losses carried out of the concentration on the issues of their losses .
the amend@@ ment was me@@ ant to improve the business model , the nov@@ el Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally in 2003 in Chelsea and then inv@@ est strong to improve the team and to build a global brand .
during the current three @-@ year period , up to 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Presid@@ ency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , its UEFA successor A@@ lek@@ sander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be elim@@ inate of regular editions .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will increase the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the UEFA FF@@ P , compared with The Associated Press in the last week .
although the PSG buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has paid in a package bowl , it can distri@@ bute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five year contract for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.6 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanc@@ tions in 2014 has taken together with Abu Dhabi , which is in pos@@ session of Manchester City , with the pregn@@ ant sanc@@ tions .
the PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , who was lo@@ wered to 20 million euros , and it was placed on 20 million euros for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is search@@ ing for clubs , which could try to con@@ sol@@ o@@ ists by companies that are connected with the owners of a clubs .
while an Catal@@ an enterprises could be spons@@ ors when the value of the spons@@ or@@ ings must be higher than leg@@ it@@ imes income .
just this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA &apos;s spons@@ or@@ ings of the PSA Tourism Division was launched .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the organisation of the WM 2022 in Qatar could come .
but Pakistan and Kat@@ ar 2022 have suffered that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM @-@ amb@@ ass@@ ador will be found and a unique man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ atory authorities could be found .
the previous sanc@@ tions against PSG indicates that the UEFA EURO will be noted , any att@@ empt to leave the rules .
the UEFA had no prepared tal@@ ks with PSG on n@@ ym@@ ars transfer , giving the people who familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of an@@ on@@ ymous with The Associated Press , since they were not author@@ ised to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest reports will show that the 2015 / 16 sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year are still published .
the n@@ ym@@ ars is expected to be a blessing for spons@@ oring @-@ De@@ als , Mer@@ chand@@ ising and Jersey .
the association proce@@ eds from that the turnover is expected to rise at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ r@@ c@@ ited to see one of the best football player to see , and they sought to prevent sh@@ ym@@ ars that they would result the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial d@@ op@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the official property of PSG .
Arsenal Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by US Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , the leader of La League against a state which is financ@@ ed by a club .
&quot; it is the consequ@@ ence of own@@ ership and which has completely changed the entire landscape of the foot in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association it is all possible .
it is very difficult to resp@@ ects the Financial Fair@@ play , because you have different ways , or different interests may have a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is located on the search@@ ing for a new sch@@ og@@ g@@ ili@@ ate

but more import@@ antly , all@@ em@@ al of advertising effect : for a sch@@ og@@ ging manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
like many applic@@ ants in the new tender , the Swiss will not dis@@ missed the Swiss Life .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , the Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y will make a renewal of contract over the spring 2018 .

according to the regi@@ sters , there are estimated ten million people with foreign citi@@ zens@@ hip , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will be managed in Germany after about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .

the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to remain unchanged , that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak econom@@ ies and the atten@@ uation of inflation have been ste@@ amed over an increase .

after the decision on the interest of interest , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the MP@@ C remains the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , as the pressure on the real amount of households remains the consumption of consumption . &quot;
the interest rates repeated that &quot; a certain degree of monetary policy &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; ext@@ ent is required when the markets are expected .
markets include the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank bet@@ onte however , Incre@@ ased &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; will be &quot; gradually . &quot;
the Bank forecast for this and next year , the Bank forecast for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % were predic@@ ted .

the decision on any changes come after the recent growth rate , the rising growth is increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly relaxing after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation forecast for households which is affected by an increasing inflation and low sal@@ aries , when the loss is more wor@@ se , before it is better to be better .
it was added to prevent the monetary policy in the next few years , but it can &apos;t added that the w@@ ages at the end of their current year @-@ thre@@ ef@@ r@@ osis &quot; significantly . &quot;
the economy will also be strengthened by increasing demand according to British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which compens@@ ate a lower consumption of the lower consumption .
the decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the left of the Pf@@ un@@ des .
the bank estimates that it is likely to last four years until the prizes and the economy will be fully reached .
before the last judgment of the Bank &apos;s interest rates , the rep@@ utation had increased pressure on hard @-@ thre@@ at , since the inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ difficult households in July and an increase to 0.5 % .
the inflation was fallen in the past month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this is expected and they will see it in the next months .
the Bank said to prevent over@@ hau@@ l in relation to their target of 2 % , &quot; quite &apos; the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent reservation of the Sw@@ ap @-@ R@@ ats , the Mort@@ gage market should be stronger again compet@@ itive , as the credit card will be looking forward to shops and this year .

patients will preser@@ ve the financing of HIV @-@ pre@@ venti@@ ons from September after one battle against the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sex@@ ually mature comm@@ ented pre@@ ex@@ position pre@@ ex@@ emp@@ yl@@ axis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the inf@@ ecti@@ ous risk by around 86 percent , now from health service is delivered by an initial three year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial in the last year , after the App@@ eal Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice , w@@ on@@ ach of N@@ HS decided to pay him to the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should be financ@@ ed .
the announced chess was announced by N@@ HS England , Simon St@@ ev@@ ens declared as &quot; important new inter@@ vention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) . &quot;
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , Brig@@ h@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first , which will follow the registration of people , and further clin@@ ics will be introduced in October 2018 in all England .
pre@@ ex@@ position spro@@ yl@@ axis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparation which contri@@ bute before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV @-@ transmission to inf@@ ecti@@ ous substances significantly .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines being present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as two hours before sexual inter@@ course .

the program will be signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract on delivery of medic@@ ation in this week after an international compet@@ itive performance .
the study is to split the entire potential of pre@@ p , by clinical trials , as described in a large scale , was recorded and implemented .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new inter@@ vention should be the extensive and incre@@ as@@ ingly successful efforts to re@@ mot@@ iv@@ ation of HIV .
it is a further mil@@ estone in which more than three decades in progress and adv@@ oc@@ ation of one of the biggest health issues of man@@ kind . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a dec@@ is@@ ive moment in the fight against HIV .

from September to people , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financ@@ ed test in England , to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner with a partner to improve many lives .
we welcome all this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ g@@ ins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out in all the country that the study will be carried out in all the country , and that no@@ body which is returned for HIV .
now , since the pre@@ p test medicine was acquired , we have been on the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health mini@@ ster@@ in , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is due to monthly del@@ ays and dec@@ isions by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence show how trans@@ forming these drugs as part of our approach to the HIV prevention , and the transmission of this life @-@ war .
this att@@ empt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in all the country to protect HIV globally , and that they will contri@@ bute to the spread of HIV at the society a step closer &apos; .
the big living : mezzanine and cle@@ ver@@ e design@@ ers tri@@ cks have changed this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in a gener@@ ous home .
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former member of a passion for real estate , covered in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not un@@ zi@@ pped her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a lot of bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I search@@ ed for something that was similar to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceil@@ ings .
I love them in love with this day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square feet has been completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a s@@ laugh@@ tered layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne reser@@ voir and a mezzanine to use the gener@@ ous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , plenty light .
that was my mind , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , the 12.5 feet high ceil@@ ings and a home to create a home but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the archit@@ ect@@ onic challenge was able to create a mezzanine in which one could be able .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the advance .
&quot; the steel plant is quite comp@@ lic@@ ated , explains it .
&quot; we had to ar@@ range the rooms so ar@@ range that they had to st@@ acked together without us without us .
it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel is so that he had the right height or below the right height . &quot;
this type enabled bo@@ fan , two rooms in full height survi@@ ved , with a lot of additional dr@@ ama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper light window of Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us on the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ant residential area .
mir@@ ro@@ red Gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays an role in the direction of theatre , room and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him longer .
in the kitchen , the mir@@ ro@@ ring fe@@ els like a window in a different room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units accommod@@ ates all the Sn@@ ail and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perc@@ eption of a smooth space , the beauty of the living room can dis@@ missed the kitchen when it is not used .
un@@ folded kit@@ chens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a gar@@ ag@@ ship .
&quot; a bit of engineers came in , &quot; explains the fan of the steel reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is mut@@ ual , so that it is the door , very easy g@@ ins . &quot;
thanks to CLE@@ VER@@ EN usage of space and box , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated , says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment form , real estate agents will perform a real estate agent and carry out a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot;
here they made it to enlar@@ ge the floor area and use high quality materials , creating the room his luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and help to create a em@@ oti@@ onal binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electric power outlets in the walls .
they are important but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a apartment is characteri@@ zed by good design and increased area of somewhat standardized in a little bit more amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , could you deci@@ de to leave this not .
brethren fight for an 500 million US dollars of real estate
two brothers are four decades after her itali@@ an family founded the d@@ yn@@ ast@@ y family , in a practice of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ al Vict@@ ori@@ as worth $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his j@@ unc@@ ed brother Paul . this has brought him to be transferred to the Supreme Court as ye property and business management .
Paul wanted to return from family business since 2014 , but a sharp view over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna poss@@ ess the Brothers 38 properties in the value of more than half billion dollars , collected by the 1973 a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
in the West@@ co je@@ ans family , the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 single shops .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio by De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city center , the development of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the city .
after an agreement with their dec@@ eased Father own@@ s Col@@ in - Paul as the main oper@@ ators and dom@@ inated person@@ ality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - roughly two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s people and Paul about one third .
a cum@@ ulative em@@ onies that this means that Col@@ in own@@ ership of 316 million dollars and Paul worth $ 176 million in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash prize has proven itself for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the proposed conc@@ eption took him with the back , what I stayed for the best objects in 2015 , he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday , after several comm@@ ence investig@@ ations took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the Brothers also strug@@ gl@@ ed to control over the existing shop - where Col@@ in , as Paul claims it was excl@@ uded .
Col@@ in arg@@ um@@ as , this is not true but th@@ rows Paul to manage several owners .
in an early mon@@ d@@ dav@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to speak the battle .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority . &quot;
the cost is in the case , with hundreds of pages with mon@@ i@@ dav@@ its , e @-@ ma@@ ils and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading law@@ yers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and of both sides .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants who were operated in the late 1950 @-@ years and in the early 1960s , a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick sold .
they used the security to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ Li@@ egen@@ schaft to buy the family in Col@@ in the first Je@@ an@@ wood family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there , when he was in my last years in the high school , when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , ho@@ ff@@ ed their sons to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he would never wanted to l@@ anden the brethren before court . &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is @-@ group , wher@@ eby Col@@ in claims that Mark the company &apos;s worth 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid .
as well as Mark are Mark Paul , &quot; Paul &quot; says about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has been very back , though he was a former A@@ FL board member , and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took up with Col@@ in and Paul De Lut@@ is and their law@@ yers Contact .
only Col@@ in answered via SMS to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case was before the court .
&quot; it is very familiar that my brother Paul decided to escape me , and to draw our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tried to ful@@ fil the demands of his brother &apos;s level .
&quot; our father would not w@@ oll@@ ed that Paul and I would like in our current battle , he said , and added that he was still on a solution . &quot;
on Friday , these hope will be over .
&quot; our angels will be dissol@@ ved in near future of the court , &quot; wrote Col@@ in .
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plant , the Media ab@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have been tem@@ pted and are finished .
perhaps John F. Kelly will actually do .
if yes , he will be the first .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to make information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news medi@@ en - in the hope , the b@@ oss on a similar course .
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day , he exhibited a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White house , which he rep@@ airs : poor information that will conduc@@ t into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that would like to flow it - whether on paper or in writing - because the President better dec@@ isions would get a good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to re@@ pt@@ ing Tr@@ ump by caus@@ ing his medi@@ ates .
President of Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship between decades was back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong .
&quot; if the candidate applied for an un@@ fair report , it was produc@@ tive to show him that he was transferred to him , &quot; said the former voting rights of Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos; s &apos; s to hold control , according to six former voting rights offici@@ als in it , to ensure that his personal Medi@@ oc@@ ation has been awarded at a ste@@ ad@@ ily special price . &quot;
Ok@@ ay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps has ever been ever &quot; under control &quot; was sm@@ ile .
perhaps these camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s something , what we know not know that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets without their inter@@ venti@@ ons yet contain more ignition .
we will never know something about the twe@@ ets that wasn &apos;t sent Tr@@ ump .
if his people saw it already some times , off@@ ger from him , then , their efforts were re@@ warded .
but no@@ body has consist@@ ently prevent it that Tr@@ ump sum has come out .
a part of the problem exists in a wil@@ low house that emerg@@ ing in a wil@@ low house , always att@@ empt@@ ing to introduce her own agenda , making their own Agenda from the world .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO - quite with this history - reported in May about the pre@@ vent@@ ures of consult@@ ant , President of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold .
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump offici@@ als say that Tr@@ ump can re@@ act as a vol@@ cano on negative press sections , especially such with damaged le@@ aks , and that it can find out to find out this date .
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone had a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , gave the dep@@ uty Chief of Staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch by L@@ ecks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson because of Sch@@ ik@@ ans lasting from an Twitter , or that he was offered no concrete evidence that he expressed himself into the past , or ref@@ uge in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
in addition , the former Chief of Staff of Rein@@ ce P@@ ith@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to manage a system to manage the Pap@@ i@@ erk@@ ram to manage and documented the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly trying to do three months later , the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective man@@ agers as P@@ ith@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his pulse self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors are still in influence .
this basic factors make wa@@ it@@ hm mission very difficult .

from Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Luise
from the former place Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the house before the gates of Fre@@ ud@@ enst@@ ad@@ ts has been renovated and opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , due to the former Ambiente Company mbH , 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 over@@ nights were lost per year and also revenues through the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , a dram@@ ati@@ cally rising numbers of refugees that came into the district , located in the rural building , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which was in the contro@@ versi@@ al discussion .
the city pre@@ vent@@ ed the accommodation of as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers through the setting of a building plan to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not in@@ str@@ anded in the municip@@ alities .
however , in particular Fre@@ ud@@ ge &apos;s Supreme Court Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interest in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel bir@@ hof over a vol@@ unt@@ ary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the group recorded four houses with the Fre@@ ud@@ guard object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad M@@ al@@ b .
the hot hotel Luise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
at the former hotel Birken@@ hof , there are already a longer time period before the entrance , and if traveling the house is notic@@ e@@ ably , wel@@ comes complete renovation work .
the floors have been extrac@@ ted , ceil@@ ings to the part , old bath can be removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
to March there is much too much .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .

Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : US Special Invest@@ ig@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
in Russia @-@ affili@@ ated by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is scheduled to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
the Gre@@ mium &apos;ve recorded the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under calling with the thing cont@@ ing@@ ed people .
the newspaper valu@@ ed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller will be widened shape and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N transmitters CN@@ N reported an initial out@@ line of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s eld@@ est son and a Russian law@@ yer .
in the US intelligen@@ ce services , the Kre@@ m@@ l. has been mixed in the presid@@ ential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is examined , whether they gave birth between Tr@@ um@@ ps elect@@ oral team and Moscow .
in focus of investigation , several men are to be established in the election campaign as a consult@@ ant of the Republi@@ can .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more dr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the Lu@@ pe .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special Invest@@ ig@@ ator Tr@@ ump pers@@ onally had pers@@ onally in the centre , and the pres@@ cri@@ b , whether the President of the aff@@ air might have dis@@ abilities the justice of the aff@@ air .
the main collection of the Grand Jur@@ ys is it to check the evidence of possible acc@@ id@@ ents in possible acc@@ id@@ ents and deci@@ de whether the indictment should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called to the indictment .
mostly , it is switched on if it is greater and contro@@ versi@@ al cases .
the procedure takes place always behind closed doors .
the Gre@@ mium can also be enabled by the prosec@@ utor to be switched to people under don@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were exhibited in order to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian law@@ yer .
people who participated in the meetings , be asked to a testim@@ ony in the report .
you should also provide documents in documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consult@@ ant and v@@ ast re@@ ward J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his then election of Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that Mu@@ eller will not leave that Mu@@ eller should not be te@@ ach@@ able in his work , and that he should be necessary to act as soon .
but it was not forced to sign that the Grand jury will be on on the end to deci@@ de on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the foundation of the Gre@@ mi@@ es of the beginning of a new phase in the investig@@ ations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new unveil@@ ing , the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia Aff@@ air as a campaign in his political opp@@ onent .
&quot; the Russia history is a tot@@ ale in@@ vention &quot; , said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give an opportunity to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they nothing else have to speak about that they may speak . &quot;
his special ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position when he was nothing of the uni@@ fication of a Grand jury .
this work but also usually in secret , st@@ ressed he .
the White House is fe@@ ared any measures to acceler@@ ate the work of special tests on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; mode .
the earlier F@@ BI CEO James Com@@ ey has said three times that was not determined against the President .
I have no reason to accept that something was changed , it was in the statement .
Mu@@ eller was only been used after Tr@@ ump of Com@@ ey had been un@@ employed .
because of this r@@ aus@@ age , gu@@ ard@@ ed against Tr@@ ump , he would like to dis@@ able the justice .
Com@@ ey said in June of a Sen@@ ats@@ off , Tr@@ ump told him a setting of investig@@ ations against the then national safety consult@@ ant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President stands for the study under a large pressure .
according to the representation of US media , the White House was collected against the special Invest@@ ig@@ ator and its staff .
the sol@@ ved sp@@ ek@@ ul@@ ations about it , whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller can be ign@@ ore .
differ@@ ently , as an independent special Invest@@ ig@@ ator of the Congress like about in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has become a position in which he might be theoretical on the end of the President of the Justice Ministry of Justice .

Ant@@ arc@@ tica : Gig@@ ant@@ astic Eis@@ berg operates in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ kt@@ is , a gig@@ antic ic@@ eberg is sol@@ ved from the closing of the Sch@@ el@@ ks .
the dep@@ artments was the Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ on and marine research on Wednesday with .
the one tr@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large colleagues draw from now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
it is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice gig@@ antic , the researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people will not come from him .
in@@ spiration of climate change a role in the out@@ break of the ice ges , is un@@ clear after research information .
however , in total , however , it has a series of unusual mer@@ ks of ice sk@@ ins in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact .
according to many researchers , the researchers can be imp@@ uted with the war@@ ming .
now a broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s to date .
Sch@@ el@@ ks floating on the sea and is driven by major gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ baum is located south of South America almost at the top of ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula .
the balance of this sil@@ ica was the balance of wax and ab@@ om@@ iting before some years ago .
a complete closing is there , I writes AW@@ I sci@@ ent@@ ist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are also that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ celebrates is in danger of danger because the front edge has never been moved as far as pres@@ ently .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate among the tension and can be broken if at a key@@ point a piece ab@@ bre@@ aker .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , since it is sw@@ imm@@ ed on the water , as much water , how it causes the melting itself .
however , the loss of the case that gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low size , the British research project writes to the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Midas ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrates is nearly 50 000 square kilometers that is the largest wh@@ el@@ ings of Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
on the transition from the main@@ land is up to 700 meters thick , at the front part for the free ocean around 200 meters .
there will be regularly starting .
&quot; although it is a natural foot@@ age , and is no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the far re@@ treat since the beginning of the record , confirmed he also .
among sci@@ ent@@ ers , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ks will be back to grow or long @-@ term , and maybe now , he spoke his colle@@ ague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if this researchers led the out@@ break of this gig@@ antic ice , do not attri@@ but@@ able to climate change , so far as many ice sk@@ ids of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula .
this long time summit of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data of the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the ant@@ arc@@ tica di@@ pen@@ insula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline was contributed to the decline .
in the past 50 years , Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula have been war@@ med around three degrees to the areas where the temperature was set at the fastest way .
CD@@ U want a look at the staff
because it is more difficult to occup@@ y free work places , the CD@@ U will be found out of the emplo@@ yers to be attractive .
just before the summer break , the cra@@ y@@ day 41 new jobs will inc@@ ident .
more than 1100 employees and offici@@ als working for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 tra@@ inees at their first working day behind .
the courses during the circle are ob@@ viously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applic@@ ments were able to draw up in this year .
nevertheless , the cir@@ cul@@ ating staff are missing to satis@@ fy the spons@@ ored requirements and tasks .
there are currently there at circle M@@ ett@@ mann in front of 50 not occupied places .
we are search@@ ed among others , physi@@ ci@@ ans and engineers and forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U want to join the cra@@ y@@ Day together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and the professionals in the administration .
the administration is scheduled to work on the request of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel design and personnel development . &quot;
aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but future @-@ oriented anim@@ ations of the applic@@ ants is called .
the overall concept should be seen according to inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ verse cli@@ mb@@ ers and an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this list@@ ens to a good approach to the good approach .
because of the circle it is done with a staff problems that they knew not so .
other cities are good offici@@ als and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the address is given by a regular &quot; competition of public emplo@@ yer . &quot;
this is a high number of employees , disease , or age related information from the service .
so the highest time for hand , so that no more places un@@ occupied by more places .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Fra@@ zer of the CD@@ U , goes to a joint application in his party .
he car@@ ed himself already in the cra@@ y@@ day for a fine surprise that he set the personnel cost of public in question and the remaining parties bl@@ oss@@ ed .
people want to be ver@@ ified that all options are checked out of the municipal emplo@@ yers .
&quot; if we have not short notice at a satis@@ factory solution , the round@@ ab@@ oration of the trade uni@@ ons - maybe even in cooperation with the circular cities - an optional weekly rates , &quot; so Pe@@ op@@ les .
in order to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and civil servants is better to pay as it for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are pres@@ cri@@ bed exactly , increasing or more money there is only if you arrive in a higher level , which is based on professional years .
but the task of the circle are always grown in the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up , in which the stip@@ ulations of the new pro@@ st@@ itu@@ ary protection law cells were care .
not last through the increasing number of As@@ yl@@ um , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and county director Martin Richter is a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shi@@ fted the tone to N@@ GO @-@ Mig@@ ran@@ ged rescue boats
in Italy , N@@ GO@@ s , who use rescue boats for mig@@ rants in the Mediterranean , that they cannot continue to keep it on new rules for its operations .
&quot; if N@@ GO@@ s have no new behavi@@ or , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the turbine daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is War@@ ning got a day after the Italian authorities made a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; youth , because their team had produced effectively with human hands in a way that il@@ legal immig@@ rants .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation since a year since a year , based on the app@@ reci@@ pro@@ st@@ ances of the Italian State Opera Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us , and remains the salvation of human life to our top priority . we are very passi@@ d that we can &apos;t generate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in a position to the social media .
&quot; we can prove all inst@@ al@@ ments , which are currently being collected , only after we collected all information and the situation can be explained . &quot;
the Italian authorities were the boats of &apos; youth rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ venta , since October 2007 .
it is thought that his occupation of inflatable mig@@ rants will be delivered to them directly from human hands to them that you can use the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers that the ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting there was only 1.3 miles prior to the Liby@@ an coast , according to the Ac@@ te of State , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew shall dec@@ eived by the authority of the itali@@ an territ@@ orial , the lif@@ ebo@@ ots in the zone of humanit@@ arian reasons , and not out of any other mot@@ ives .
among the behavi@@ oral co@@ dex , boats like the I@@ u@@ venta must have been on board an Italian police car , who over@@ looks their activities .
only three of the nine N@@ GO@@ s , who are involved in search and rescue service are ready to hold the code : Save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter still told that the new rules as an un@@ necessary , but accept@@ able , since they don &apos;t have any &quot; major changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; their rescue operations .
among those who ref@@ use to sign to sign , the Nobel Prize for Medical Doc@@ tors Without B@@ orders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of mig@@ rants who returned to the rescue measures in Italy in the last weeks , that the efforts fell by the strength@@ ening of the li@@ by@@ al coast@@ line and cooperation with local leaders .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the Tun@@ n@@ els , &quot; said to minister .
he gave plans for more tal@@ ks with li@@ by@@ ries of people in this month via economic development policy and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of mig@@ rants who can reach this countries in the hope of Europe .

this is also known as the first federal lig@@ aver@@ aging an incre@@ as@@ ingly re@@ act in this range .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a e @-@ sport department in mid July and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .

with pro@@ min@@ ent E sport@@ ers among the contract you could be present online more than once a year the federal lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ess to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
at the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA on compet@@ itive level .
longest , such as at normal sport , L@@ akes are established in which the pro@@ s mut@@ ually comp@@ ete against each other .
and at Asi@@ ans 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but it &apos;s in order to get a right sports ?
for many , the performance saf@@ ely in need to aff@@ lic@@ tion needs .
also Ingo Fro@@ sting is also long with the question about .
for the Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is compet@@ itive and many biological and physical reactions . for example , increased heart rate , ho@@ re@@ actions , hor@@ mon@@ al changes .
also need it co@@ gn@@ itive cap@@ abilities , a technical and t@@ ac@@ tic understanding and fast response .
professional Gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console , but also to exercise its body on food .
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
happy does not see problems : &quot; d@@ op@@ ing is always more a theme . &quot;
checks are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene is missing the structures of the classical Sports .
positive conclusion was the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internation@@ ally on the way that is like a great family , there is no inter@@ cultural Hem@@ m@@ issions .
a study of business consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Government Commission software ( BI@@ U ) says to E @-@ Sport is a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , nearly 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , spons@@ oring and great tournaments .
sales in three years the turnover is 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football player , that is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , bas@@ ketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consult@@ ant .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ bas@@ ket@@ eer Sh@@ aqu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez on the U.S. team N@@ RG team .
Hollywood @-@ actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sport competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe it is also done in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as class@@ room , says Fro@@ b@@ ail .
in the Netherlands and France , the football League Cup was oblig@@ ed to sub@@ mit to D@@ ut@@ t in the mean@@ time , a E @-@ Sport division .
in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; explains the V@@ f@@ B @-@ board Rö@@ tt@@ g@@ ermann .
only in nost@@ alg@@ ia , and the old times are cl@@ ari@@ fied , this is not anymore .
it is therefore to preser@@ ve the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time in the modern market .
&quot; we live in an digit@@ alised world , &quot; Th@@ ut@@ t D@@ ut@@ t .

Mich@@ elle Carter due to the texts that Conrad Roy to su@@ icide in su@@ icide .
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts has been sentenced to two years in two years because they gave their friend by texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Mich@@ elle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their verdi@@ ct behind g@@ it@@ ers and five years were susp@@ ended .
Carter was sentenced to life in June for pro@@ long@@ ed murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing of the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ clean .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legisl@@ ative arg@@ uments that they knew both them as well as Mr Roy to a psych@@ ic ill@@ ness .
in red H@@ oses and a cre@@ am@@ eless b@@ use , I stand Carter da with te@@ ars in the eyes , with folded hands and down in the eyes , when she was condem@@ ned .
&quot; your actions took Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosec@@ utor of the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she had no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no Reu@@ e . &quot;
but Car@@ ters att@@ or@@ ney said , It is a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ st@@ ances that she was fully thre@@ at@@ ened . &quot;
jud@@ ges Lawrence Moniz said , he did not found that her &quot; age or matur@@ ity , or even their mind ill@@ ness have a significant effect on their han@@ dic@@ ation . &quot;
a State Att@@ or@@ ney las a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , that there is no day that I didn &apos;t have the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like to know that he is proud of me , and how I have to go with all of my pain@@ s that we can bear for the et@@ ern@@ ity with us , because of his si@@ sters , it is ther@@ ein . &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dyn Roy , told that they might be pursu@@ ing out of the knowledge &quot; that they will participate in the wedding of her brother &apos;s wedding , or a ts@@ ante for his children .
&quot; don &apos;t have this only one person who have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will keep my life for the rest of my life . &quot;
the case seems to set a legal precision in that there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , which makes it possible to ask any other committed su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in one vehicle .
in the case , national attention moved on itself , after Car@@ ters text messages revealed that they had encour@@ aged it to end his life .
&quot; hands on the spring of a building , first , I know not , there are many ways , she said in several news that sent them into the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family .
in front of his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All that you must do the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
jud@@ ges Moniz said that Carter is tem@@ pted by the death of Roy , and ordered that they benefit from any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter def@@ erm@@ ons , belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was condem@@ ned in 2007 because of murder of her British Mit@@ be@@ erin , before she was acqu@@ itted of two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Mich@@ elle Carter serves some experience and help , not prison . &quot;

lav@@ ender &apos; lav@@ ender in Provence by climate change
he is a symbol of the Provence in South France , but there is a warning that he is thre@@ at@@ ened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is re@@ mem@@ bered , because of the diseases transferred conditions and on the diseases transferred ins@@ ects , what scientists and farm@@ ers who are trying to find solutions , big he@@ ada@@ che .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse , experts of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively dangerous because the plant was susp@@ ended in the past few years , who brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has imp@@ acts on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and in very deep weather , there are very many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for holi@@ day@@ to , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Ch@@ a@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long vegetable gro@@ w@@ ers with a large number of flowers , we have been under@@ developed and either missing or missing .
so we have less pieces with essential oil . &quot;
to solutions that are drawn into consider@@ ation , belong to a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing from the ground , but also the b@@ low@@ ing of plants with a protective mix of clay , water and the development of s@@ orts , which are resistant to dry .

the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of an journalists und@@ ern@@ ing growing thre@@ at in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ od@@ oce will usually make Wedn@@ esdays for reporting the youngest ch@@ aos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , organised by organized crimes , corru@@ pt civil and in@@ qui@@ et@@ ly drug ad@@ rie@@ ge .
but in this day , in the shadow of her own trag@@ edy , they came together to talk about security .
it was shared with them that it is important to change its rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ time journalists will discuss what saf@@ er fe@@ els : they shall take their children with into the office which were aim@@ ed at home of a attack with Gran@@ ts , or at home .
safety experts have three words on a table on the front of the room : opp@@ onent , neutral , al@@ lies .
they requested the rep@@ orter , names for each column - No proof is necessary , perc@@ eptions and ab@@ dom@@ inal fe@@ el@@ ings .
there is dr@@ ug@@ g@@ ler , polit@@ icians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists ent@@ ert@@ ain to stand , on the other list of government or Kart@@ elle , a catalog of corru@@ ption that make ch@@ aos of Mexico .
there is no science break from the violence , and throughout all the land the bodies , are always more journalists at least 25 , since then President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena ni@@ eto published in December 2012 . 589 are following att@@ acked and drugs under Bundes@@ ver@@ ies and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .
under the latter , their publ@@ ishers and their in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ od@@ ology , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mist@@ ake it is to live in Mexico and journ@@ alist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his abs@@ ence is deep , though his presence is present , though its presence everywhere is present - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his center @-@ finger on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Ri@@ od@@ oce , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ Shirts which show his sm@@ ile d@@ ill or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orter discuss their divided topics , the trau@@ ma , their al@@ pine trees , sleep , Par@@ an@@ oia .
although 2010 was built in 2010 to work the cases of journalists from journalists to investig@@ ate the cases of journalists only two pen@@ dic@@ ation procedures .
like most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are connected to each year with drugs and organised crimes , the mort@@ ar of journalists are only rarely seen before the court .
at Ri@@ od@@ oce she still exist still to treat the power of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ clean and even though the terrain now is still ob@@ vious .
without information on the mort@@ ar , without righteousness , has the meeting at the discussion of the security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very sil@@ ly , my time in this workshop , says he .
&quot; as long as we know that Why do we know all of them . &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ od@@ oce from the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Co@@ roll@@ a was given by two men . he was p@@ oured out of his car and 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was gone into his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours with them to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free .
but for the topic of Val@@ dez , there are virtually anything as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become a blo@@ ody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country to fill the ri@@ val@@ ent fr@@ actions here to fill the vacuum .
it is nothing to be shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or more people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of ver@@ ti@@ fied , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug , which are larger than many houses for the living .
place for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a card the control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bo@@ urs and drugs trade in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez saw the d@@ ang@@ ers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ od@@ oce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not be prot@@ ecting his friend .
he beli@@ eves that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of a interview recorded with Damascus , L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ent cart@@ ons in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans .
this publication can be destroyed the sons , assumed power members of each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second f@@ ault was ther@@ ein , Val@@ dez was not to forced to take part in the assessment of another newspaper that had the same history , to leave the country into its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ illing is considered a mil@@ estone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he did so long survi@@ ved that his friends and colleagues draw that he would be always there .
he was active in 2003 as experienced rep@@ orter for No@@ ro@@ este , when he graduated with five colleagues at the founding of Ri@@ od@@ oce and 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without on the rough@@ bre@@ d problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper comp@@ acted a rep@@ utation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ est@@ ing reporting , and the advertising were recorded .
rep@@ orter loved it , hard tre@@ ating exam@@ inations without fear of zen@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fas@@ c@@ inated by a publication in which they were able to treat stories .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ od@@ ology received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists to protect the Mexican drugs history , where ever they led them .
he gave himself up volun@@ tar@@ ily to that he had an@@ xi@@ ety .
&quot; I want to experience in addition , he said to the time of the CP@@ J Award .
Dro@@ gen@@ ic in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you need to use the task that falls to you as a journ@@ alist , either or you play the Dum@@ men .
I would not want to be asked : &quot; what did you did as many of death ... why did you do not say , what did you ? &quot;
the Ri@@ od@@ oce @-@ Team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was able to cur@@ se the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ug and coun@@ ten@@ ance , a teacher , who knew how to survi@@ ved .
they conf@@ id@@ ential on its rout@@ ine .
he would wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar from the office , go and there at the same table .
now , I ask them , &quot; was his love to the rout@@ ine ?
his death has also asked them to ask their own shares in question , as they can stay their work at the best .
&quot; you do not want to move with their women , their children to move their clean stores , their sec@@ rets , to move dr@@ ills .
&quot; these things were not allowed &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ adhesive and self locking device .
keep his own instruc@@ tors .
if it wrong , ab@@ b of them .
the Trou@@ ble is said the editor of the Ri@@ od@@ oce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; sm@@ ell a sense that can be heard ... and then is the thing with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - the same as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a tox@@ ic blend of lu@@ k@@ rati@@ ves sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ uten , weak institutions and corru@@ pt government .
the landscape changed continuously .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ od@@ oce met for safety training ; were suddenly no phones allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to govern@@ ments , for monitoring journalists and acti@@ vi@@ sts in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the National Government to protect the offices from Ri@@ od@@ ology in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in March , some of the rep@@ orter asked whether they belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen that govern@@ ed themselves as non @-@ confidence .
it is months ago , since the rep@@ orter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drops of fac@@ tories are under control .
for the edition of this week Ri@@ od@@ oce attracted three main stories .
there was the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the national coup , which foc@@ used on the hom@@ et@@ own of Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office , an un@@ loading .
there was no official word which was to pass , or as it was happened , so it was that time , so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favour@@ ite place of drug ad@@ ers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ kers , who govern@@ ed the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I Govern@@ ors were accused of corru@@ ption for corru@@ ption of corru@@ ption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked to write the rep@@ orter of this loc@@ alities in this loc@@ ality , including one , in whom a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went into a military accident .
just a few months earlier readers the column of Val@@ dez took the best inform@@ ational source about the release .
&quot; previous , what happens , what happened in Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; with its sl@@ ender .
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was de@@ voted to storage for signs and stick@@ ers that has been de@@ voted against the Mor@@ de of journalists prot@@ est because they have never been expected : acti@@ vi@@ sts in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter@@ in Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , a few characters and went to a demonstration on a demonstration for a further journ@@ alist to the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame dis@@ appeared three days after Val@@ dez were killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burning body has been discovered and civil servants , based on DNA tests that it is .
in all country , journalists become more stronger , caus@@ ing them in organic prot@@ est &quot; SOS Press &quot; are written in the country .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez moved to Washington and att@@ empt@@ ed to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on day after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of Val@@ dez def@@ att@@ ed Ram@@ i@@ rez , the authorities , ex@@ cre@@ ting the journalists , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that they once again divided by the government , because it is concern@@ ed that their wor@@ m@@ ness has inj@@ ured their objects .
Val@@ dez had to be repeated that journalists killed in Mexico from organ@@ ised crimes including government offici@@ als and a constant society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , he wrote that Re@@ porter cannot be killed by drug subjects , but also on the order of polit@@ icians and security forces , who had organised crimes under a blank@@ et .
the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has passed over half of the attacks to journalists from the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico you die because it would like to think the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
in ob@@ viously the Mor@@ de have a terri@@ ble effect .
no@@ body passed the death of the b@@ logger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in northern border of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones are besides her separated head .
some branches have selected such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Ch@@ ih@@ u@@ ah@@ ua , after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of Cor@@ respond@@ ents Mi@@ ros@@ l@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
other makes more , like it was El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of its direc@@ tors in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ cl@@ y publi@@ cl@@ y publi@@ cl@@ y publi@@ cl@@ y public on the front page with a guid@@ ing article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are flown from their home country or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and ob@@ serve the streets and seek after d@@ ang@@ ers .
and sometimes they are ge@@ dly , as it mani@@ fest@@ ed to the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was mur@@ dered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to continue and occup@@ y the work is a daily dance with risk dec@@ isions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to be po@@ et in po@@ et , that the drug may be stret@@ ched him .
&quot; Mexico go to Hell , and so I was rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
at mid@@ night on Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ od@@ oce used to the office and d@@ rank beer , as at once all their phones started .
a number of shooting files with band@@ en@@ ri@@ val@@ en and security forces near the bath@@ ing Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 aff@@ ir@@ med dead .
the war goes further , how it was promised through a range of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ od@@ oce on the website .
the cover page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ enes he@@ aded nearby - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez caused a look at the polic@@ emen to see the ven@@ ge to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they did not afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen of the newspaper , whose mid @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed by the staff of Ri@@ od@@ ology .
&quot; how can you think it only to close , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; When the same day when Javier was mur@@ dered , the tra@@ inees who was on the streets to send them to reporting on the streets . &quot;
Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used Tar@@ gets to so@@ aking his enemies
at the first sight , it looks like a statue , even though a sho@@ ck@@ ness .
now , researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible n@@ ash@@ age of an Canadian Ber@@ gar@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have been described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they were able to con@@ vince the skin of red@@ dish brown , and they said , they have had some of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report presented in the magazine &quot; Current Biology , &quot; it was found him as &quot; awarded the Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , who ever found ever found , and one of the best Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered species of N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the ch@@ alk @-@ time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its un@@ believ@@ able good condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant remains the best preserved Fos@@ sil in its way .
it was found by Sha@@ wn radio , when he was in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met a little bit what about the b@@ aked Rock f@@ ails at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to draw .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him discovered the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years , the wild be@@ ast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be unveil@@ ed .
&quot; if you are just a little with eyes blind , could you think almost believe that it has been s@@ laugh@@ ter , &quot; said the main writer Cal@@ eb Brown , sci@@ ent@@ ist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature can be seen .
&quot; it will be in the science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs specim@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ os@@ au@@ rier . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant f@@ aul@@ ers , although it is covered with a Arm@@ or , and it is res@@ embl@@ es by the car@@ ni@@ vo@@ y Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs .
the strongly pav@@ ed Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used a red and white camouflage , to hide themselves , and used a scre@@ en@@ ings , which is known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ung , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been possible to mix well in its surroundings and to ensure that , experts , that it indicates that it was thre@@ at@@ ened by larger din@@ os@@ au@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs created in May for the first time and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now stud@@ ying the wild animals and it is called Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum &apos;s Museum Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that have more than 7.000 hours to be carefully po@@ uring it carefully .
the amazing maintenance of the copy of Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of sho@@ ppen and arm@@ or@@ ations regarding his body .
they discovered the con@@ schat@@ yk , a wides@@ pre@@ ad defence method in animal kingdom , what means that the tip of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was as their under@@ side .
although the conc@@ eption is common , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly , since the size of Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , far more animals survi@@ vor@@ s .
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of enough pressure due to flesh f@@ ad@@ ress Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , that the Evolution is the wear of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most of these contemporary animals - remember to R@@ ise , Zeb@@ ras or Gür@@ tel@@ tiere - are much smaller and viol@@ ated as a pre@@ y , what sign@@ ali@@ zes that this N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs was to survi@@ ve a real battle .
&quot; strong pre@@ animal behavi@@ or on a massive , strongly pav@@ ed din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs bre@@ asts of the cra@@ ft@@ y had to have been &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic connections in their sk@@ ills also shows that the skin of the Din@@ os@@ au@@ riers is red .
scientists investig@@ ates still the animal on crit@@ ic@@ ing on his life , including his conserv@@ atory Dar@@ min@@ ent to find out what it has e@@ aten it as its last meal .
they believe that the Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , as he died in a river , and went into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was so warm like the south @-@ fle@@ as today , and rivers and oc@@ e@@ ans probably have a lot more growing than they today are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because he is fully covered with preserved gr@@ illed skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal reserves , &quot; said brown .
&quot; the result is that the be@@ ast is almost the same as in the early ch@@ alk time .
you do not need to use imag@@ ination to re@@ construc@@ t it . if you &apos;re only a little with eyes , could you think almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the cra@@ y@@ time was a time as a huge Ther@@ p@@ odes , fle@@ eing Din@@ os@@ au@@ riere , which stood on two legs , and the earth .
although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ au@@ rus Rex , million years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pav@@ ed Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs became im@@ pris@@ oned by some of his f@@ urch@@ ill .
along with the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ au@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ sters .
scientists , whose latest findings in the journal current biology will believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta moved to death in the sea and in the mu@@ d &apos;@@ m@@ um@@ ta .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , the preserved Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely from the sn@@ out to the hip .
the cre@@ atures were weig@@ hed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weig@@ hed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long points that made by his sh@@ ould@@ ers .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant f@@ aul@@ ed through the Western Canada , until a flo@@ od@@ ed river it was built into the open sea .

the stone remains of this special copy are so good to cover the ho@@ w@@ age even more pri@@ ght ar@@ mo@@ ist along the din@@ os@@ au@@ riers
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko is written for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of preser@@ vation &apos; rarely like a profit in the lot@@ tery .
if I love it , the dest@@ al turns it .
the stone resi@@ due of the skin always cover the hol@@ ed tank plates which wear the sk@@ ull of the animal .

in the th@@ underst@@ orm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many inj@@ ured
heavy accident on Thurs@@ day@@ night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are managed in a massage bol@@ age .
there are numerous conf@@ usion , spr@@ ints from - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , the late Thursday morning were inj@@ ured around 20 people .
after the first data of the police , against 17.00 o &apos;clock took place between the terminals in Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a ge@@ wit@@ ters almost 30 vehicles , among them probably lor@@ ry , in@@ expensive .
about the exact number of the last documents not currently no data .
it is around light to medium inj@@ uries , said a pol@@ ishing .
a big Auf@@ geb@@ ot on rescue vehicles was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in Fahr@@ enheit , Munich was a ten kilometres long back town .
as a AZ @-@ Re@@ porter , it was also reported on the counter@@ f@@ unic@@ ular dis@@ abilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade made the license number of the vehicle handleb@@ ars who have to calculate with sensitive sk@@ ids .
shortly after 18 : 45 pm , a second accident at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was to a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue hel@@ icopter was driving on the accident at the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that everyone has already experienced , has nothing s@@ its in the train and sleeps .
or man is ver@@ ti@@ e@@ ft into its work and has just a great thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes in the beginning of the work@@ flow , the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ ak@@ ened the driving pleasure in the heart of the work@@ flow .
driver card control .
but the times of interru@@ ptions are over soon .
the Germans are currently tested the ultimate driver card control .
you will aff@@ ir@@ med by cell phone that you have taken his place and evalu@@ ate the ticket .
there is currently a test operation on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , and it &apos;s wide .
it is likely to be available at the beginning of the next year on many further distance routes in Germany , &quot; said a way speaker .
&quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the way ticket sales without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use the use , however , some requirements are fulfilled : you need a Smartphone or Tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what are they &apos;re going to do most passengers .
it also has to be purchased over the App of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the convenient type of ticket is .
and last you need a sitting space reserve .
the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : it rises in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
in the test customers then an button to electronic designs will appear .
the train conductor will receive a message that Pass@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and the booked seat is taken place .
the train att@@ endant with the driver card at place Y knows that there is a passenger with already purchased online ticket .
so you can continue to continue to continue to continue .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two benefits : one for the customers , one for the railway - what again use the passengers .
&quot; who is relax@@ ed without ticket control through our train staff travel , ch@@ ick@@ ed in the DB Navigator just myself .
this allows the passengers to design their journey in the next door , &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , Marketing executive board of DB correspond@@ ence .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time more than today to have the individual customer requirements . &quot;
who often meet you know that al@@ ong@@ side del@@ ays and pas@@ sport bre@@ ast@@ es the driver card checks are among the greatest doctors .
because often one of the one of the one of the passengers do not have all documents it is required to de@@ aling online tickets .
either is missing the credit card or the identity document or otherwise one document needed .
the result are end@@ less discussion between traction and elev@@ ations , which leads to wor@@ se m@@ ood in the part or large space and del@@ ays at the end of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time he takes care of the time .
only one small number of test customers use the new service .
and also only onto the ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
another train numbers on the same distance are not un@@ locked .
how to learn a acti@@ vi@@ st@@ in to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any rose up to its core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the night was born in St. Louis , on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ ched by Facebook on their phone .
she proud of a mail from someone out of the High School .
&quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , and it was there .
closed , because there was no information on their Fe@@ ed the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ the@@ e@@ Pharmac@@ o@@ ah has been constantly wor@@ shipped to their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the region of St. Louis , was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white police in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , and was killed live .
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns li@@ los@@ ing body which was stret@@ ched on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; I thought about yourself .
but death was for them and her fel@@ low@@ ship of nothing .
you laid your cell phone to return to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police and people who cried , and from a man who claimed a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
follow a live feed for a group of demonstr@@ ators with a b@@ ell@@ ent dog in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators .
in another video , she said , not@@ ified another polic@@ eman and cried out , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all of them . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s not usual , he remember their testim@@ ony to their testim@@ ony .
&quot; that &apos;s not the kind of murder , who are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to us and we can tell us . &quot;
at this moment I felt Schütt@@ el@@ frost .
I was w@@ ager and we@@ pt . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home at home .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father , and decided that the two on the next morning were coming to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with je@@ ll and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in cin@@ em@@ as from the 11 .
it is a story of the survi@@ ving and prot@@ est , the strength and the resistance , the strength and the resistance of the people , who live in the community and the streets are filled to ask answers .
in her daughter , with her daughter , which had a flower dress , and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , discuss the two talking about this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I have taught you when black men have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; I remember what they said .
&quot; we go now to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police has killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and it was not right .
I could not take it , &quot; he said well .
&quot; that , what happens , is a high point of what happened in the past .
they must know it and see it .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to be free to claim ourselves .
even if I have lu@@ cky enough to give you an experience , when she was pers@@ onally not able to do not a cl@@ am@@ at@@ ant r@@ ass@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have I feel that I would have a bad service to keep them from them . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , which was used to a camp as the acti@@ vi@@ sts on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there were in je@@ ll and her daughter with a local busin@@ ess@@ ors , the lunch made .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ved them into demonstration .
slowly started a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for je@@ ll form .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August , she said , &quot; said it , &quot; said it as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student International Course , and foc@@ used on Ess@@ ence of Justice and Health In@@ corpor@@ ations in Black con@@ greg@@ ations .
&quot; I had no experience in organ@@ ise .
it is all came . &quot;
weeks later , in the evening , during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ Reg@@ is@@ se@@ ure of the film .
fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to wanted only &quot; documented &quot; what happened .
a question occurred in the sense : &quot; will you have documented or tries to find a story that you can use a story ? &quot;
this Sk@@ ep@@ sis was more no@@ ur@@ ished by count@@ less cases of hum@@ ans often - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance to their resistance .
such as fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview , &quot; we had heard that people who have grown in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis together with an artist from the area that is known for its acti@@ vis@@ m to To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt ins@@ ur@@ ers .
his commitment brought the project closer together with six other loc@@ als the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns er@@ shi@@ fts .
&quot; this documentary is not a man who speaks for us or with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main cause for me how these people are displayed , because I will be displayed . &quot;
the goal was not to focus on p@@ ll@@ s experience to focus , in order to show the movement &quot; not around a Messi@@ ah leader , but for a fel@@ low@@ ship , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the mani@@ fest@@ ed of participants in the film .
in@@ consequ@@ ently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of je@@ ans living like her and her wife mar@@ ries .
&quot; I felt like n@@ aked , &quot; told us and laugh@@ ter , when they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I have underst@@ ood that there was a certain viol@@ ation of black people in this work , and in the case of the black people . &quot;
in addition , at@@ he &apos;s history the role of the black flu@@ ids women in the wid@@ est Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement that were marked after the k@@ illing of the black Teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as weak .
&quot; black , Swan women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we fight against various fron@@ ts .
black , Swan women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an agre@@ e to that &quot; movement really is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is , however , this is no aff@@ ir@@ able type of action , &quot; in the j@@ ll due to their identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who tou@@ ched these energy , she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not an accident , although they were on front , because with a life to these cross@@ ings as a black , Swan woman is so much on the game .
you can feel their energy by the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news camera in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has gone long , but the r@@ ass@@ ist connections between the assembly and the police continued .
j@@ ll is based on application for 2 ½ years due to block a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere in the area that her home calls their home : &quot; a ch@@ aos . &quot;
nevertheless , she is a song and she felt in this mem@@ orial since then she went up three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our oblig@@ ation to fight for our freedom .
it is our oblig@@ ation to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; dream &quot; up &quot; Greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV reader discuss about bit Gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although they are not long been built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pe@@ de@@ strian zone since the first presentation of 2009 was the population in Be@@ ing and opp@@ onent .
cold , the theme bar@@ ely hardly an .
the theme will also be discussed at our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one @-@ bit Gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; needs no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite light : &quot; greater s@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while be@@ ats that a gallery can benefit more customers in the city , of which the other shops benefit , fear the opp@@ onent , that the pe@@ de@@ strian zone is hi@@ de@@ ed .
the gallery is planned : the gallery is planned on the grounds of the farm@@ houses , in the 13 direc@@ tors mark@@ eted its products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be at the end of the construction work .
the Gallery Ma@@ cher want to integ@@ rate a market in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to stand outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have already been a week in the farmhouse mark@@ thalle for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land very gl@@ ad@@ ly again .
the but@@ chers have also discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the Galerie a chance to receive this offer .
in other cities there is also the same .
especially the small mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether a direct mark@@ et@@ place in a mark@@ thalle in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
the new project will probably not be low for the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what to buy shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermar@@ kets : I find the surprise .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many charge stores here are empty - some since months and years .
but there is not a ordinary weekly market , it is so important that our mark@@ thalle remains at least .
because it is offered the stock of fresh , mainly is offered directly from the generators and is ob@@ end@@ ous in@@ expensive .
as you can see , charging business in a shopping centre only from larger companies , because the dor@@ m are not portable for a retail@@ ers often .
sh@@ ame , special business , there are almost no more and that , which is still left , will probably dis@@ appear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the pe@@ as@@ ant market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration when the bit Gallery is somet@@ ime in fact .
or creates a bit @-@ gallery even before all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it is easy to work .
and an shopping center , that is empty , no one needs .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real pe@@ as@@ ant market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmhouse mark@@ thalle , it will find many - how I can find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
if the farmhouse market is made , a piece culture will dis@@ appear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates port@@ ra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ notic@@ eable same - the cables of the ceiling .
the 30 port@@ ra@@ its were sent by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , made h@@ orn@@ aments and hair@@ pin that have been sent out of Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the prosp@@ ects from the prison Fort Le@@ aves worth where the former intelligen@@ ce @-@ Analy@@ tics had a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after they had publi@@ cl@@ y publi@@ cl@@ y publi@@ cl@@ y published over the website Wik@@ il@@ e@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ ens@@ ance ( an appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspond@@ ence between De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , whose discipl@@ ine was established in technology , computer science and art , a trans@@ gression and land@@ mark , whose condem@@ nation of Bar@@ ack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the alg@@ orith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could be interpre@@ ted with these gen@@ om@@ ish data , as if any int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual comment were not only be interpre@@ ted , as they can be interpre@@ ted and the toug@@ h Det@@ erm@@ in@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , which was born by Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already found more about the identification as wife , was condem@@ ned in 2013 because of 20 acc@@ ents , including six viol@@ ations of the Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and the@@ ft .
by the prison , her image has been pressed , so very that it was only a single photo , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the man is notic@@ e@@ ably on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde W@@ ig carries it with them .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has just returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portrait of stran@@ gers from fore@@ ver@@ ic species as a cigar@@ ett@@ le and Kau@@ g@@ um , caus@@ ing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of it , like these people could look like this people .
this was the time to receive an e @-@ mail from an newspaper magazine .
&quot; she was conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while they had been in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to join this article , De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg at a press photo of the new exhibition .
and she could not present at this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed at this time , so they took contact with Chelsea , they asked whether they wanted a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and their induc@@ ed m@@ use were ex@@ changed several letters in the course of two years .
they even had an illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Sou@@ p Images , &quot; who would also convert a future predic@@ tion in the President of Chel@@ ten@@ de@@ ah , and it would be to see the exhibition pers@@ onally .
Obama really is only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven thousand years in a military court in Kan@@ sas , was a ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary kind of lu@@ cky meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and Star@@ kes , da Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against Inform@@ ations from the government camps and against trans@@ ferr@@ ing forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to find the rigid case that he should fit to escape .
as De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , after the st@@ range of tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , called Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) , whose foundation was sex , bre@@ ed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is the mit@@ och@@ ond@@ ale DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of C@@ s and G@@ s and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg ho@@ ff@@ ed , through the relationship of 200 letters ( or Nu@@ k@@ le@@ ot@@ ide in the artist ) show how amazing similar , at least in biological regard , we all are .
&quot; what people of which ho@@ pe@@ fully will take place that our gen@@ ome is not so kit@@ ten , who we are and like a gen@@ etic data for a interpretation and how subj@@ ective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so they are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a room , is a site from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how it takes place with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ inary Academy of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech in cold , then they won , &quot; is it . &quot;
&quot; so never sm@@ ell the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter to tell me , &quot; told the artists who gre@@ et from Philadelphia .
&quot; I &apos;m still looking forward if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not been pers@@ onally seen - as it was done in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it to be done in the middle of the space of the mas@@ ks , who would like to summ@@ ari@@ ze their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation as hor@@ des of prot@@ est .
this was also tar@@ get@@ ed such as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which was written with their gen@@ etic Hap@@ log@@ ue groups .
&quot; in the past , I wanted to do it to the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human quantity , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg .
&quot; I wanted to fe@@ els like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , such as movement , also behind its liberation . &quot;

the Start @-@ ups to help your company not to become the next generation
Am@@ y Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the in@@ qu@@ eries did not work .
answers were often v@@ age , little helpful or - even wor@@ se .
and even if you deci@@ an@@ on@@ ymous spoke some workers to process the process .
&quot; there was just never consist@@ ency and objective &quot; , said Er@@ rett , who is the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed .
she has been called by the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is the Wach@@ sen to help companies so far as their employees feel .
due to create and licens@@ ing of software , the specific purpose of staff commitment , it allows to conduc@@ t the specific groups and dem@@ ographic groups , speci@@ fying species and dem@@ ographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ers allow to pass the C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they have now tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the tr@@ acking of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analy@@ tics Tools of companies is used to measure staff commitment .
Er@@ rett said they have a better sight into what your staff think and feel at the three years with Gl@@ int .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap in@@ qu@@ eries and sur@@ ve@@ ys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that have shown on a glance which will show the majority and exec@@ u@@ tives test results - so that you can see , why .
the company will come to con@@ vince that at the top of the workplace culture , that it was not to be found in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who speci@@ alised in Sk@@ and@@ ales , who talked in Sk@@ and@@ ales , which were spoken by Bel@@ est@@ ations , who talked with those who have been given .
for the start @-@ ups like Gl@@ int , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ c@@ ative busin@@ ess@@ ness .
the Global Governance , Reg@@ ulations and Compli@@ ance sector could have more than $ 118@@ ,@@ 7 billion , according to the final technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to avoid bad behavi@@ or , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , there has been recently signed by cli@@ cks .
like Gl@@ int , allows Conver@@ cent company Custom &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; Re@@ qu@@ eries , conf@@ id@@ ential responses in real time and the warm@@ th maps of your problem .
it also provides an an@@ on@@ ym@@ es @-@ hot@@ line , with the employees of bad behavi@@ or .
and when the chief leader is related to the Supervisory Board .
the Court of Public opinion has recorded the regulations , &quot; Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that its staff is bad@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience any consequences thanks to consumers @-@ bo@@ c@@ ott , worker c@@ tu@@ ation and cl@@ esi@@ ons , qu@@ it@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent are employed for more than one year to ensure that staff and procedures can be ad@@ vised to achieve their business centres .
previously , if a accused wanted to report a problem , he needed or to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s company , a form@@ al compl@@ aint and hope that it was done .
it was often a limitation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ b General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good possibility to track the compl@@ aints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent can have problems that have been hidden in offices or states , which were hidden in offices in cities or States , as dis@@ cri@@ mination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unknown intern@@ ships .
&quot; I can closer to this whole , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , which is leading the Ris@@ k Management Group by Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment dis@@ pu@@ te . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and staff commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur And@@ ersen , because of ethnic viol@@ ations of the En@@ ron Sk@@ and@@ al , said Quin@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; soci@@ eties came to their right , &quot; that the company knew that you could not think that their cont@@ amination were online .
&quot; before the use of technology for Eth@@ ics , used people as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Gl@@ int as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service of services , and secure the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of its products .
it is a business model and a chance that assi@@ sts the agreement of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who supports both Start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and TO@@ LA Capital , which gives the entire capital to $ 47 million .
Glit@@ tering Glit@@ tering $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his whole financing to $ 60 million .
these investments will bar@@ ely sur@@ pris@@ ingly , based on the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that the present staff of its work@@ places are expected more than before .
in compet@@ itive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
people want to have the feeling that you acc@@ epts and estimated that you will give your time a positive mission with a positive mission .
&quot; if the people are gl@@ ad , in a company you feel to make their voices , and that the work will do to make them , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent as well as Gl@@ int .
cli@@ cking to reach its portfolio when its portfolio is well run . companies run well when employees are going to set out and committed .
if the Analy@@ tics Tools Party you promise , commitment and the use of employees , it is no w@@ onder that you can find support .
data from the staff commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are used when the p@@ amp@@ holder of a company has no measures .
in fact , if a company employs people after your feedback , it may be a expect@@ ation that is on the way .
and if the change does not be fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointment can be pun@@ ished and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 days , you must have ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen themselves to have the coll@@ ecting data .
&quot; because if you are not follow , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ?
do you care about ?
and who do not care for you , why should I ? &quot;
Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , the now monthly employee sur@@ ve@@ ys , was able to inform us on the same day , when a problem was reported about the same day when a problem .
and after the coll@@ ecting from the feedback from fru@@ stri@@ ated employees , it was to organ@@ ise its implementation and quality of communication , im@@ pregn@@ ation , several teams within the company &apos;s re@@ organ@@ ising problems and communication training .
Ruby Tuesday receives the company always new in@@ sights on the staff , and it ho@@ pes to know that in long sight , this will result to a better binding of emplo@@ yers in a branch , which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ed to create a culture of transpar@@ ency , they lose people , said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you lose company .
the NCAA remov@@ es the two @-@ day prac@@ tices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it goes to 23 clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players on a page of the new exercise in the teams in the camp@@ us .
some have their fun se@@ pt and indicate the back full of sc@@ atter@@ s of the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the teams provide a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses are returned to their final test , before they will return at 6 : 30 pm on the river football Center .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real tre@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday .
the NCAA elim@@ inated two @-@ day exercises to fac@@ ilit@@ ating the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three train@@ ings of the U@@ C@@ LA take place at 19 : 15 to make the player to be righteous .
the com@@ promise away from the two days is more than one day in the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season , while the summer school took place during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood .
they should hold over 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of form@@ al playing time for their start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he could change the amend@@ ment of the NCAA support , even if they emplo@@ y a further point in the player .
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they simply pressed them , they pl@@ aked them , they are great people .
I think once we come until Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its intern@@ ship as soon as the Camp is finished , as soon as the Camp of its fields is thro@@ wn by a ad@@ jac@@ ent private parking and the ad@@ jac@@ ent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the ad@@ jac@@ ent class , which is already cle@@ ared with floors , which is a protective network behind a tor@@ rent location , no light task .
Bru@@ ins player should be the hotel in this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ati@@ al that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will im@@ plement our security , &quot; told Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far h@@ aul@@ ed to think that people can rent there a room and then set to record there a exercise .
if you have video the video from a exercise , it is quite good store .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I do not make my wor@@ ry for me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to be facts in battle against f@@ ake messages .
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages from third parties and their results under the original contribution , that is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to com@@ prise F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a position on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to det@@ ect the detection of detection and they may prove the fact of the facsimile check out of the original items .
Facebook was recognized as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they also affects the US presid@@ ential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political theme , with the French vot@@ ers of the presid@@ ential elections in May with wrong stories , and Germany also supports a plan , according to the social media networks , if it doesn &apos;t hes@@ itate to elim@@ inate post@@ ing post@@ ings as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate Declaration on German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts inspection will be started .

create a com@@ ic @-@ ROM : a castle in history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years old .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cosy seat in the river valley in K@@ ent and is now for in@@ spiration for a graphical nov@@ el by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ oph@@ a@@ ar@@ igen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ fixes for historic documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look to the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says W@@ ehm@@ ut .
&quot; what a personal relation to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s exciting time from the Middle A@@ ges to the period of Edward and documented the families who illustrated in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , in@@ coming British artist . Isaac Lenk@@ i@@ ew@@ ic@@ z , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Palmer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; dead Men &apos;s TE@@ ETH and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expected .
&quot; I have written only on the th@@ umb @-@ print on the side of a letter so re@@ acts , who was written by a double agent in the 1700 @-@ years , who worked for the James , he says .
&quot; that is its continuous print !
and letters sm@@ urf@@ s always after smoke , because then the fire is a fire because of light .
for someone who lived 300 years later , the sm@@ ell has a effect when he himself would be even .
ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for anyone who is defe@@ ated by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ our@@ able to be a little over@@ rated &quot; ) that everything seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the vi@@ cal &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and many treas@@ ures and cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ al@@ ese heads to the walls and the bottles that had cent@@ uries in the grave .
he wal@@ ked through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and said to Land@@ scapes and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , night he tran@@ k &quot; wh@@ is@@ key and began writing . &quot;
the in@@ time history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received the full access , when the last er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as Rho@@ des , one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which A@@ rist@@ s said , &quot; Oh , th@@ f it on the lo@@ ft . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who did eat , &quot; I could think that , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a Bir@@ ch to f@@ ought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection , use the castle as the starting point to spread over a wider basis into the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle , which leaves the farm@@ stead of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a concert that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ ly Fam@@ ilies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ ant stand began in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising is a good start .
perhaps the two communic@@ ating with each other ? &quot;
other stories are fir@@ m@@ ly hidden in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it &apos;s history , which is the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , which he made his own evidence ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos; Lieb@@ est family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men &apos;s sk@@ irt se@@ ful G@@ aun@@ er to be back again and money for things that they were not able to aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s de@@ struc@@ tive their training cr@@ ises , by caus@@ ing old women , I bring it to me as a bunch of good be@@ ware , with a tal@@ ent to be ex@@ plan@@ ar . &quot;
after the end of his application in the castle , Rho@@ des on the search of other unique writing experience
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish Wild@@ erness for a com@@ ic nov@@ el@@ ki that was brought to the territory of a San@@ at@@ orium from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ dem@@ anded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was s@@ ad to go again , &quot; says he .
it was like : &quot; Oh , I have to be finished again with the condem@@ nation . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old of the Virgin Mary in R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ â@@ elle in R@@ hö@@ n@@ dorf , the City of Bad H@@ onn@@ ef has started its campaign to launch a new roof top ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z will keep the logo and s@@ log@@ an to his home .
at the end of August it is to be a high point of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; , ask the ma@@ vers of action since yesterday on the posters on the R@@ hö@@ n@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think it ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make sure that it seems better than it seems .
in the grave we are the firm re@@ au@@ tion that we know as Bad H@@ onn@@ efer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ ti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
in the action I go to more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a s@@ log@@ an , it is further .
&quot; it applies to form@@ ulate a general use which gives the city a distinc@@ tive sole mark . &quot;
finally I stand in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
a mean five @-@ digit amount is the town of Bad H@@ onn@@ ef their new roof and the campaign cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans fear of the army
every year , at the beginning of August , at the Ankara Military Council ( Y@@ as ) , in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ es and carriage rides .
so also this week .
at the first sight a normal process .
but nothing is rout@@ ine in the Turkish Ar@@ med Forces a year after the att@@ empt .
the session won &apos;t place more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the Am@@ t@@ ss@@ itz of the Prime Minister .
the five Vi@@ zep@@ ool also participated in the govern@@ ments of government leaders , as well as the Minister of Def@@ ence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
this was the civ@@ ilians in Y@@ as in the over@@ count .
the government moved to the army in the military .

at the m@@ orn@@ ed Cou@@ p , Staat@@ sch@@ ef Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and adm@@ its .
more than 10.000 soldiers have been removed from the rows of the army - mostly due to the movement of the ex@@ ile Pre@@ dig@@ iti@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire pul@@ ler .
around 486 people who have been involved in the coup att@@ empt to participate in Ankara , will be held in Ankara since this week .
already a day after the coup att@@ empt was re@@ ferred to the over@@ throw as &quot; God called &quot; God , as he would give him the opportunity to clean the Ar@@ med Forces &quot; . &quot;
but has pe@@ as@@ ant the army really in the handle ?
end of February published the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ ous &quot; published a article with the heading &quot; Dis@@ claim in the Military @-@ Haupt@@ quar@@ tier . &quot;
in the general Staff , there is an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ist &quot; of the army that is among others in the sup@@ erst@@ ruc@@ tion of the head@@ band for sol@@ dat@@ as mani@@ fest@@ o , wrote the newspaper .
the majority of the army in the army and security forces is going to be further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an gave another 73@@ 95 state services , including 230@@ 3 pol@@ ishing and 546 soldiers .
in this case it was considered to im@@ pris@@ oned the military at the military .

Ministry of Renn@@ stran@@ gers &apos; route for Renn@@ stran@@ gers
over the last months over the future of the race course had been str@@ anded in the past few months - now it is to go quickly .
even before the end of the year , on the road route , which goes to the tourist railway .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stran@@ rs in long @-@ term , according to the traffic of the Ministry of Transport in this year .
&quot; with the decision to order the Il@@ men@@ au race past@@ ry continued to order and to re@@ hab@@ ilit@@ ating the country to this especially for tourism important connection , declared traffic Secretary General Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for maint@@ aining the distance decreased to approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country was 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle can be ordered in the future of the country , it will be defin@@ ing the pres@@ sures in the future .
the Ministry and South@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Train as the operator is based on the technical details .
&quot; these are the ti@@ met@@ able to be employed in vehicles and comply with the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
by that , the race track Shuttle will be ordered as a regular basis for December 2017 .
the race past@@ ry shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ st@@ eig .
in the past few months , a pilot operated was used , whether the distance of sufficient many people will be used to buy them in the future .
the route is also advanced in parts .
the climb of sex rob@@ ots is real , and we should make us Sor@@ gen
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be ver@@ ified in 2017 , a new report on techn@@ ological developments in the field of sex robot .
Yes , really .
sex robot are currently a big thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for the Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex rob@@ ots in the next five to ten years .
according to no@@ ble Shar@@ key , em@@ er@@ iti@@ oned Professor for Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield , and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we need to start their rise .
customers can choose the eye Color of the robot , its shape of the breast and the type of f@@ ing@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; the people make about it fun@@ ny , but the company deliver every amount of which , and we will have much more frequent , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report .
modern sex@@ pu@@ ffs have been developed by their infl@@ amm@@ able partners that fe@@ els warm , fe@@ els warm - with con@@ sci@@ ous human reactions that reaches artificial intelligen@@ ce through the artificial intelligen@@ ce .
the user can also adjust its rob@@ ots to fit &quot; and can choose everything to choose from the eye Color of the robot on the shape of the breast @-@ handle up to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ e@@ vers .
but there will be more trou@@ bled , since many rob@@ ots make the &quot; person@@ ality &quot; that would look like a St@@ ep@@ ford @-@ woman .
modern sex@@ pu@@ ffs have been developed to rob@@ ots with a silicone fo@@ res@@ kin .
for example , the Real@@ m ix robot enables to adjust its use to adap@@ t their rob@@ ots to the properties like the Schü@@ ch@@ el@@ ty .
and then there are still the true pers@@ onal@@ ities of True Comp@@ anion &apos;s sex robot with pre @-@ programmed pers@@ onal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; the impression of the Schü@@ ch@@ u@@ pt@@ ure and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; ab@@ olic &quot; person@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has an person@@ ality that is possible to describe your person@@ ality as well as possible , &quot; The website of True Comp@@ anion .
so like it , what you like ? and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day the vote - as much as real people !
it can be fixed to be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in the m@@ ood ! &quot;
there are many enjo@@ yable aspects of sex rob@@ ots - not last because they transl@@ ate real human relations - but the wor@@ thy female properties that is appro@@ aching one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : wid@@ est ) Far@@ rah , be@@ auti@@ fully inv@@ ent a most .
on its site , True Comp@@ anion Ro@@ xx@@ xy comes with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , but for men .
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why can I have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robot are not only one feed table or just another sex .
your birth and their increasing refin@@ ement show a little Dun@@ kl@@ eres and lo@@ wering in our culture , on a return of the equ@@ ation of Gender E@@ quality on a wish to sex with supp@@ ort@@ ation as optional tension .
most of course , of course , no sex robot , and during the FR@@ R , their rising popul@@ arity will remain provisi@@ onally at the edge of the consumer culture .
but what from the Rand@@ z@@ ons , can live in regard to the Spirit of the time , in which we live , very taught .
and many people are not st@@ range or besi@@ eg@@ ed , until them the free market will be used for permission .
there is a certain exceeding , that this highly developed sex robot in a period in which the rights of women are thre@@ at@@ ened worldwide , in which there is a President that means that the women have been att@@ acked to have sexual att@@ acked .
the aw@@ es@@ ome aspect of the television series &apos; The handi@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures that works for the bodies of the body , but as realistic this vision .

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the judgment of the healthy son of lives
it is to become a B@@ ins@@ en@@ we@@ ish@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump era that have become a political don@@ ations that have the US vot@@ ers - have also spread families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ y@@ fest gave it in the United States newspapers by Advice on the USA , how to continue with the Hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump sum .
we stri@@ ct all alle@@ ge@@ dly to make our filter jack@@ ets .
less notic@@ ed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I chose this , because my co@@ usin , a lin@@ ks@@ du@@ ster , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ can in our family , who visited this week in New York .
remember that the unity against a common enemy has a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone , who knows them , including the repub@@ li@@ an relationship , with which she had strug@@ gl@@ ed because of polit@@ ics , suddenly and completely con@@ stric@@ tly on the same side .
around the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also provides significant risks .
the lin@@ ke was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the impact of his Presid@@ ency has the power to shoot us all after the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ iness that we will not be more ab@@ orted to a day .
however , there is still a higher @-@ time scen@@ ario , in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards suddenly compared to his standards .
I find my do@@ zen of a active nost@@ alg@@ ia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney - the dog on the car or the dog on the car , which was 14 % comm@@ itt@@ al tax ( but at least did we see how its tax statement looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
if Tr@@ ump returns , the next candidate of the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans must be healthy healthy to quali@@ fy as un@@ wor@@ thy improvement .
when my co@@ usin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ el in the New York City department , and the best three dollars that you have no ca@@ ff@@ eine .
the horses are enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are kno@@ cked , and the animals turn to look at full of their own sh@@ ould@@ ers - extremely Finnish and wor@@ st music .
so many blades of a city of a city : the views of high buildings are familiar , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to provide a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city will not be righteous .
five and thirty years later , and I am still quite more about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topics pu@@ b ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a wei@@ rd mag@@ ical experience , as two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years , and all have a great time .
when I would have to rate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately , no@@ body has been asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to evalu@@ ate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could draw my credit card .
in the coffee @-@ house on the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy a little over the cargo .
this does not lead to a slow@@ ing of what is actually a neutral replacement , but does not work on the server to use person@@ ality in a situation which is not required .
the poor woman in the department store stood up , while I ti@@ red the experience to sub@@ mit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ol with breast pain from j@@ ail to the hospital .
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time for the second time .
last year , he was transferred to the treatment of inc@@ isions to the hospital , which he was transferred to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to life imprisonment for Mor@@ avia after an appeal against the appeal .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of St. Valent@@ ino in 2013 by giving them several times a door of the toilets lo@@ ins in Pre@@ toria on her house .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night@@ mare in a night@@ mare in the cabin .
the citi@@ zens@@ hip have announced their int@@ ention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from which they say too .
the National Criminal Court said that they will be performing at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection was to be heard in this year .
Pist@@ ol &apos;s risk is a danger that its penalty is increased to 15 years when the citi@@ zen are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

the young is indeed different as the other young people ( ch@@ ick ) , but also this .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free to be freely .
they wish to meet each four stroke that he felt in his new school in his new school .
it was followed by grat@@ itude to the col@@ leg@@ ed , the former school director Michael Müller , who again succe@@ ed on lessons and the par@@ ent .
the coastal time is now over , declared class Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their students after two years of teaching only , because it was a really great time .

Software Update for diesel vehicles : what are the affected now
how does the software update instead ?
what do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars offered .
they should improve the emissions behavi@@ or of cars of emission categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or bad are excl@@ uded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine of ACE Auto Club Europe are Evaluation :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
No , the full software updates are vol@@ unt@@ ary .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory update previously apply only for the vehicles which have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the KRA@@ FT@@ FA@@ HRT Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and from when , customers will be informed about updates ?
the manufacturer have announced a gener@@ ous implementation in the next months , but still no more accurate date .
Daimler has informed , each person concern@@ ed every person .
if it is due in a inspection , it will be dis@@ posed in their frame in their frame .
how long is the up@@ grad@@ ations go down to a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; thought about S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the cur@@ tains of eng@@ agement of the manufacturers as well as of political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , volun@@ tar@@ ily sur@@ rendered to the car manufacturers at the environment of the environment . &quot;
how long should the update ?
the conversion itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ proof could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts that drive no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
ACE is waiting for waiting .
probably you thought of foreign manufacturers , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
are a massive retail price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will be afraid .
but in the regions , where passengers are dro@@ wn@@ ed .
in rural space , there is no value losses for older diesel .
the ACE is still waiting for sale .

we make the city of living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes coming to the next year in Ren@@ te .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are however r@@ ar .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work will always have fun games like it in the press conference .
it reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , that date , no candidate cannot fill the required profile .
the city is looking for next possible time a archit@@ ects or civil engineer .
thus - under observation of the regular cancellation policy - even enough for a integration .
since Has@@ l@@ ach was to serve as an sub@@ mit authority as the Lower Saxony authorities , the applic@@ ant authority must be associated with the applic@@ ant .
because this function wants to keep the city to any case .
if it would not fill out this non @-@ fill the citizens to cons@@ ulting until Off@@ enburg .
but bour@@ ge@@ ern@@ ä@@ ous is the city and as important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating sk@@ li@@ ma as well as good m@@ ood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects were collected on the chi@@ pper with pri@@ de .
&quot; we make the city of alive , &quot; is he itself throughout the office and its staff .
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the low @-@ house parking lot of approximately are arrived .
the Kin@@ z@@ ig@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the St@@ adi@@ ons@@ ani@@ zation is still on the topic .
it alone has about 1.5 million euros in Beech alone , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all we wait great tasks to my successor .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
design be designed for a cit@@ y@@ Master large game room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and G@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acts on multiple re@@ acts .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will be mentioned by citizens and visitors often .
since the old town as ensemble is important , it is important to have an eye to have been approved , &quot; when re@@ construc@@ tions are approved , bet@@ s the separ@@ ating city master .
w@@ age does not contri@@ butes to the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister high respon@@ si@@ bilities .
he is bau@@ herr , &quot; at the end it runs here over my table . &quot;
when care and coordination can count on long @-@ year staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence since ten years , Manfred Schö@@ ner ( underground ) has been in existence since 15 years .
also that his successor is long , W@@ acker : &quot; we search@@ ing for someone who did not identify the place with the place . &quot;
for contin@@ ually , is not important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker would like to prove his studies as a diploma thesis or Bachelor with field of architecture as a diploma thesis or Bachelor of architecture , and have a good sk@@ ills in the fields of building and design .
the urban development and dep@@ loyment , construction planning , basic construction work , administration of urban far@@ ming , urban operation with building yard and urban building services including a monument protection .
bike for lines thro@@ wn : southern rail track closed
according to the police , so far un@@ identified the blue bicycle from the railway station in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) had to be thro@@ wn onto the lines .
these were so heav@@ ily damaged that the her@@ ent freight train had to be changed .
the investig@@ ator comes from two male val@@ leys and seek for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ ort there were witnesses of a ros@@ ot@@ enes and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; that is far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ st@@ reich , &quot; Ö@@ BB @-@ Speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA .
the or per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors had brought themselves in great risk and also end@@ ang@@ ered the train .
next to the damage to the engine and the plant , as well as the delay of the rail and the costs for the rail @-@ operation could also come to the val@@ leys of the val@@ leys .
a total of a &quot; significant &quot; sum in total , the speaker said .
the damage were moved on Friday morning again , the railway transport of rail transport was carried out without dis@@ abilities .
nearly ten people were morning and morning were morning , two of which were on the correspond@@ ence .
freight goods were not covered , but they were del@@ ayed .
according to Ö@@ BB n@@ arr@@ ator Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be ex@@ changed around 200 metres .
isolation and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate , help IB@@ D ( flamm@@ able int@@ enti@@ ment )
red meat and chocolate can stick for your di@@ gest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory int@@ enti@@ ons .
the non @-@ he@@ aling state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000 , caused by Mag@@ li@@ cles and blo@@ om , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the data usually , meat and dairy products , to avoid their symptoms at the Wash@@ ing@@ t@@ oner , found that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an of proteins , imm@@ une cells were able to develop imm@@ une cells .
the introduc@@ tory researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that imm@@ une cells in the Dar@@ m pat@@ rol to ensure that har@@ m@@ ful micro@@ sc@@ ars that are hidden in the food , not in the body .
cells that are dissol@@ ved , infl@@ amm@@ ation are balanced , dis@@ pose of cells are balanced and protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive skin .
if the balance is too far in the direction of infl@@ amm@@ ation , it may be an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory int@@ enti@@ ment .
in experim@@ ents found that a type of tolerance promot@@ ing imm@@ une cells in mi@@ ce comes to carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs Tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an - one of the bri@@ cks of proteins - to dissol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ogas , and the development of a population of cells that is the tolerance .
more tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an had the mi@@ ce in their food , the greater than they had more of these imm@@ une cells . &quot;
he sm@@ ote that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an rich diet tolerance , less flamm@@ able Dar@@ mm@@ ili@@ eus , when the same system is also with people .
the Post@@ doctor@@ al in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an att@@ empt@@ ed to sim@@ ulated a type of immun@@ otherapy when they had found that a group of study lessons such as cells but had a different group of the same tribe that was not separated , this was not dis@@ missed .
it is thought that the difference was to do with the loan of the mi@@ ce - the community of bacteria , vir@@ uses and fung@@ zen who normally live in the stomach Dar@@ m .
the mi@@ ce of mi@@ ce were detected DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacter@@ ial species that were found in mi@@ ce with immun@@ otherapy , but without they were missing .
mi@@ ce were moved in a ster@@ ing environment so that they were not developed a Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ bi@@ om and they were not developed these kind of immun@@ otherapy , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and imm@@ une cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria received the imm@@ une system to grow in a liquid and then led small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on an un@@ ripe imm@@ une cells that were isolated from mi@@ ce .
imm@@ une cells developed among the toler@@ ances of toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid is clean@@ ed , it proved to be a side product of the Tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ mil@@ ic acid .
if the researchers have the amount of try@@ p@@ to@@ ph@@ an in the chuck of the mi@@ ce , increased the number of such cells around 50 percent , but if the try@@ p@@ to@@ ph@@ an@@ ph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mi@@ ce , and most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i will protect our mass@@ ages .
it &apos;s not known , whether Tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i &apos;s cells were able to develop as in mi@@ ce but def@@ ects in gen@@ es in relation to try@@ p@@ to@@ ph@@ an were found in hum@@ ans with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory int@@ enti@@ ment .
she said , &quot; The development of this cells is probably something that we would have to promote this cells of infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the Dar@@ ms .
potenti@@ ally , high tr@@ yp@@ to@@ ph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i had lead to a extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ inho beli@@ eves that Manchester United with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic has been a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot;

&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligen@@ ce , a gen@@ ius in the species , as he knows how he knows how he says Mo@@ ur@@ inho .
&quot; we will help him earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ inho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the In@@ dependent unveil@@ ed in this week , that Mo@@ ur@@ inho had three further new releases , but he in@@ si@@ sted on that the club already had a &quot; fantastic work &quot; had to meet three of its four pre @-@ day new liabilities .
&quot; three of four , I thank you to the club , he added to the club . &quot;
&quot; I will be happy when they get four of four , but they gave great effort . &quot;

new Tief@@ en@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as in the wind , the wind was revol@@ ving : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD chief of the prime minister of the prime minister of the elections were always with a certain Sor@@ ge to Berlin .
n@@ aked not f@@ usion from the party , blo@@ oming no har@@ v@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important wish of the voting fig@@ h@@ ters .
since Martin Schulz the party has been changed since Martin Schulz has changed .
since then the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus is growing in the SPD r@@ uled state cap@@ itals in the SPD r@@ uled state cap@@ itals .
what Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year , with counter@@ wind not been described in the approach .
there were dep@@ ths .
and one after the other .
the Bun@@ des @-@ CD@@ U looks like the sur@@ prising in the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against the SPD and green .
&quot; this shows much more : red @-@ green , just g@@ ently r@@ uled Israel , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the ed@@ itors network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the sur@@ pris@@ ingly fr@@ action held a green de@@ pu@@ ties , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) has a severe crisis in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election lost his red @-@ green co@@ alition to the op@@ position from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the founder of the Michael Kell@@ ner , the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ n@@ ly Lower Saxony flag was dem@@ anded , attri@@ butes to mand@@ ate .
the CD@@ U to CD@@ U means a clear wor@@ thy of vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke Twe@@ et must be returned immediately after the mand@@ ate , &quot; said the German leader and voting rights of the German ed@@ itors &apos; Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; that cannot be true true , &quot; s@@ eu@@ f@@ ats a SPD elections , when at Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message reached the party at Friday morning .
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is moved to CD@@ U without his own government of government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a full rows of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD @-@ Landes@@ feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ sions began with an un@@ expected defe@@ at at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the com@@ rad@@ ish time .
after the Parliament election in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was also - and although it was clearly wor@@ se .
the defe@@ at in Kiel brought the SPD in the Tau@@ ern , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ le@@ ite hau@@ te the party is smooth .
after the weeks , the com@@ rad@@ es turned into the weeks after the weeks .
then , when they had done new cour@@ age , the G @-@ 20 summit came to Hamburg .
and with him the nearest dep@@ loyment came to him .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat at the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city .
and because he was in the scrap@@ is@@ enk@@ omm@@ unications , then rather everything was wrong , what is wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil is now .
due to the VW @-@ po@@ aff@@ air and his role in the Supervisory Board of the Lower Saxony Prime Minister , has already been seen in the crit@@ ic@@ ism since 1999 .
Mi@@ ese Re@@ quest@@ i@@ fications got added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just therefore , att@@ empt@@ ed w@@ illing to add a stronger in the past weeks in the past few weeks .
the best Mayor of the former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin remained not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they grant him to grant you from W@@ eil as a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite is ent@@ ering .
in fact , W@@ eil meets the part@@ itions of the Lower Saxony in Gr@@ unde no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz already not yet .
therefore , the com@@ rad@@ es can therefore be closed to keep its own rows .
their wr@@ ath is directed to the green , and here are mainly on the back@@ side of the par@@ liamentary elections .
&quot; it is un@@ bear@@ able and democ@@ racy , such as wife Twe@@ et sees their own career , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ ers@@ ch , Chief of the part@@ itions in the SPD par@@ liamentary group , the Ed@@ iting Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. Twe@@ sten is not chosen because of its person as a direct can@@ di@@ date , but above the national event of the Lower Saxony Parliament also elected to the Lower Saxony .
consequ@@ ence , the logical consequ@@ ence would be back to mand@@ ate .
Thomas Opp@@ ermann , chief of the SPD par@@ liamentary Group , Indi@@ cted a &quot; und@@ em@@ ian man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ ers of four years ago was clear : the people saw Stephan W@@ eil as a prime minister of the prime minister of the SPD as a po@@ ros@@ ity in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal career in fav@@ our of a future CD@@ U De@@ pu@@ ties voted the election result , said Opp@@ ermann further .
he called for the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there is more or it &apos;s ongoing support of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .

who@@ ever wants to see his house in the years , you can get the next support from country .
the inform@@ ated may@@ or Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EC urban development on wed@@ n@@ esday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review to date .
since 1991 it has been attri@@ butes to the renovation of the renovation .
at that time , in the renovation of I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken two third of the funding amount .
at 60 percent in the re@@ structuring area II from 2005 to 2016 .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the former refurb@@ ishment are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only new buildings .
on 4 April you will receive information from the govern@@ mental platform that there will be a renovation area III .
the transport amount refers to 833 333 Euro , of which strength@@ ens 500 000 euro from the country , the rest of the congregation was received .
how is there a renovation area ?
you will continue to continue , if you are looking forward , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but there are also a role whether in the planned field of all interest , see also .
in case the area should also be moving again .
the ST@@ EC tru@@ sts on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .

the promotion costs of the White House cost the tax gear@@ ing thousands
the decision of the White House , a Navy hel@@ icopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for a event , which cost an American production in the last month , costs tax gear@@ ing according to the military , which were delivered to the TIME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when President on board is the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House of American building .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and sen@@ ior offici@@ als of the White house made a tour of all 50 countries .
the hel@@ icopter was built beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White house used in a frag@@ ment of ho@@ ps in a frag@@ ment order order or FRA@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before hel@@ icopter on the South La@@ wn S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ icopter .
&quot; I wanted to see that you are aware that it is a so unusual event with high visi@@ bility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of its subur@@ bs , the Dep@@ uty Nav@@ ek@@ omm@@ an@@ de@@ ur .
the message demonstrated that the hel@@ icopter was arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long , until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 o &apos;clock in this evening .
NOTE that if departure from the White house should be del@@ ayed , due to the restri@@ ction of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
during the event , the original air@@ ing crew took place during the hel@@ icopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor at the plane .
from the TIME of the TIME shown drawings went out to clear , whether a second flight articles was necessary .
the Hatch Act has been offering , state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked if the event could cause the appointment .
&quot; a question that we were asked whether it was a viol@@ ation of the Hatch acts , and we were about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the comm@@ ander .
&quot; sounds , when you are closed , &quot; the Dep@@ uty Commander of Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was design@@ ated by the White house as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a decision to reform the health reform that was in Sen@@ ast in the G@@ ange , and prop@@ ag@@ ged the efforts towards the government of government .
the use of the air@@ plane that as Marine One or Air Force One is known , from political tal@@ ent two is hardly a new phen@@ om@@ enon .
President are oblig@@ ed to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo OP is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February an investigation into the background of his first strug@@ gl@@ omer@@ ang in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages which shows the use of the presid@@ ential air@@ wor@@ se by its predecessor .
the White House is exc@@ ited by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers and American materials , &quot; said the Dep@@ uty Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ Oc@@ cup@@ ations lead frequently training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by the U.S. President in the White House with precision dec@@ lines .
when Tr@@ ump was in July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 took home 58 exercise procedures .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted at the training requirement of the flight services for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units fle@@ ets in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presid@@ ential supports . &quot;
the White House told that the tax pay the burden for any of the other re@@ quis@@ ite that were presented at the event .
a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that company is not involved in this way to present the hel@@ icopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 maint@@ ains any bud@@ get@@ ed recordings for the presid@@ ential flights , and it &apos;s difficult to determine the cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ra@@ ffle of the US Secretary of the Ministry of Justice for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D will be used for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of the unit draw the flight time of the air@@ plane as 30 minutes from the general base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the white house ar@@ gu@@ ed that the actual cost of the hoist gear@@ boxes are far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for the tax gear@@ ing on the basis of estimate is extremely ir@@ resi@@ du@@ ed , &quot; told Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 , the costs for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but transfer the costs for fuel , maintenance and contrac@@ tor .
at this time the former press spok@@ es@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the ho@@ don@@ ator for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are proud to contri@@ bute to our national security , and I go out of them that there are not even thousands of people .
and I think , as most of the Americ@@ ans are all proud of hel@@ icopter and other military equipment that worked as many Americ@@ ans for so many Americ@@ ans .
it is of course dinner , the excellent . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump with hel@@ icopter was inter@@ ag@@ ated when he had a tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man cars .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and told the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

has the PSG Barcelona in front of three years ago ?
the Page of La Liga lik@@ es its interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not be dis@@ missed in their persec@@ ution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after it was given a range of £ 189 million to dissol@@ ve his release , but they have war@@ ned before three years before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has arrived in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than the double the previous stamp , Paul Pog@@ ba went back to Manchester United States .
after the termination of the world , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive players in the world , and for the highest paid professional athletes of the world . there will w@@ ages w@@ ages more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is true through the way and fashion , such as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has given his way to the outside of the Catal@@ an board , although the club has always been given to him since his arrival made from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was war@@ ned before three years ago by the PSG President before this view ?

&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in Protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report that was commissioned by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the re@@ conn@@ aissance Law@@ yer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990@@ s &quot; with high pl@@ ains &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ ans sexual ab@@ used .
in the final report it was to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who has been working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , so that the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psych@@ ological power were applied .
in high Em@@ ot@@ on@@ ality , the pun@@ ishment for the students could also be heavy .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other mer@@ ch@@ ise , many victims of the general humanity by R. estimates and therefore it even more positive memories with him . &quot;
in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report of the ab@@ use of ab@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion moved .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; bre@@ ast@@ es of violence against gu@@ ard@@ ed at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a ref@@ err@@ ing picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to raise many students up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
to another , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ or and Perf@@ ection , the ö@@ f@@ teren has been a top performance when a domain name was no top performance .
how can you be as his bi@@ ograph report for this report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the effort and the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to ask what the name was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ever .
with him , eight pp . dedicated to him , and he is much acqu@@ itted from each sus@@ pic@@ ion or mon@@ sters in the terri@@ ble cases of sexual ab@@ use .
the viol@@ ent ex@@ cess@@ es at the pre@@ school leaving itself outside of its eff@@ ecti@@ veness .
you can see him coral in case of it , too late or first interpre@@ t not to have enough enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ al , on which he was real , was ad@@ vised by prac@@ tically all respond@@ ents - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so also the wide majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; compet@@ ent , and Bon@@ b@@ ons were operated and always received of grapes from children . &quot;
only a min@@ ority interests was worth over his PER@@ FE@@ K@@ TI@@ ON@@ IS@@ M@@ US and its high em@@ ot@@ on@@ ality , which led even at any time .
so that it was not only with a chairs and the key and the keys , but also ear@@ ns and all@@ to fre@@ ts guys to the hair or ears , he has given himself already before years ago , de@@ ep@@ est and sur@@ pris@@ ed himself .
however , it has to be said to be said that such education methods in frag@@ ments , the 1960s , and 19@@ 70s , far as wides@@ pre@@ ad , with parents like teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course I think any of us was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced in a worldwide school in a state school , experienced in a state school .
compared with which it &apos;s actually , in this report , nam@@ ely in this report , nam@@ ely sexual ab@@ use and the certain@@ ty on the pre@@ school , are the fre@@ est@@ i Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
there is no more , whether it &apos;s not more with his conf@@ ess and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI , that many media is just over@@ throw him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e , ye@@ a , many who have never underst@@ ood him .
but the Truth is : the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger Report in every respect !
in the media , the report was very much about ab@@ use on the subject of ab@@ use by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
if Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be done any ref@@ uge or co @-@ im@@ pregn@@ ancy in regard to sexual ab@@ use on sexual ab@@ use ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
No one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ handles are familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never her@@ ed me to speak with my father or my mother about it , said a person concern@@ ed for the others , &quot; It was all very good . &quot;
the true problem with the re@@ conn@@ aissance of sexual ab@@ use , yet it is that most victims are silent .
if they did not be conf@@ id@@ ols , then did not believe me in a ch@@ oral conduc@@ tors who have been prac@@ tic@@ ed a colle@@ ague of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
how to rate the Dom@@ sp@@ ans student R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in regard to the ab@@ use of mis@@ use ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a quest@@ ion@@ ably student form@@ ulated so : &quot; regarding sexual ab@@ use ... do not a case where he would have had done in which he could have been resol@@ ved in the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors and the respective val@@ leys .
I keep it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , to accept that ... Bub@@ ble in@@ urg@@ ent or clear or rather opened , when compared to their parents , Internet , conf@@ identi@@ fying etc .
that one can do with him about sex ... - und@@ ary bar . &quot;
thus the report on the very clear result : &quot; that concern@@ ed him in the field of the previous pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual ab@@ use is concern@@ ed , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is of every mon@@ sters of freedom .
so you can &apos;t be dis@@ card@@ ed him , neither prev@@ ents him or to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good names with these cont@@ ing@@ ent crime in combination , as it is unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media , much of &quot; Gew@@ alt@@ ec@@ z@@ essen was to read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger domain .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look at the report &quot; in the report .
must he do with this plan ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting period , and miss it became a huge mel@@ ange from sexual ab@@ use and violence , somew@@ here in the middle of dr@@ on , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but it is again a mis@@ use of the report .
as well as clean separately : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual ab@@ use and violence , we say once again , rest of the season .
in addition , the report emerg@@ encies from the time since 1945 , so that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did not conduc@@ t the choir of the cathedral .
all terri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ ic , cases in which the h@@ ubs of sa@@ dist@@ al teachers were regul@@ ated and including und@@ erl@@ ying , at the school @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to mar@@ v@@ ated .
yet with which Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only until her face , when they had already been on the cathedral .
on which was , as the most common witnesses , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; Tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ &apos;s &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ al ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was no discipl@@ ine , but there is no har@@ dist@@ al violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report comes to the end , &quot; many victims of the general humanity by R. estimates and therefore even more positive memories with him . &quot;
so most of the spring remains too bad .
but despite all efforts , the report could be defin@@ ing only two periods , in which it was reported from the states of the school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he had just established itself , and was responsible for the int@@ ages at a school , he was not effective and responsible , ( so the witness ) was not to hear , and then it was released again in 1993 .
encryption Georg R@@ atz@@ inger before the states of consist@@ ently the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium .
in ther@@ ein , he indicates that , &quot; that in the school , the test penalty will be pract@@ ised . &quot;
already recognis@@ ed the danger of negative press release he urg@@ ent in@@ sight .
this was of course at a time , as legal clarity , as testing drives also in Bavaria had been b@@ anned .
however , in a right gra@@ vel zone , such as every one of us are still know .
there was also difficult to estimate for him , where the affected may exceeded the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dr@@ amat@@ eur and where the allowed limit exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he could always be gone .
this is easy to do .
only in 1980 , the Trial Chamber was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
princ@@ ip@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that &apos;s un@@ fair , today &apos;s educational shows at the time of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we speak the hist@@ orian of the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of understanding according to today &apos;s mor@@ al measure .
because the princ@@ es has already been right .
but this is not true for sexual ab@@ use , which was ab@@ sent to all times , and not for that time in the pre@@ school education and violence against un@@ f@@ atal child@@ hood , which goes far beyond that time .
this is all terri@@ ble and I &apos;m gl@@ ad that it is finally processed .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
its mean to discipl@@ ine and pun@@ ishment , so ear to move to hair and ears , were wides@@ pre@@ ad in the 19@@ 70s .
when physical pun@@ ishment then was forbidden , he has b@@ anned this stri@@ ct .
the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
came the theme test for reference to language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : now , in the book it is the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his persp@@ ective , as played the domain name only a side wheel .
nevertheless , I did not know about that he led there a stric@@ test reg@@ iment .
but this must also be said once again : without these PER@@ FE@@ K@@ TI@@ ON@@ IS@@ M@@ US , without any un@@ conditi@@ onal discipl@@ ine , it would be hardly possible to form a institu@@ tion of cat@@ tran@@ g and his musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , there is no big singer and no major singer and before each success , in which the territory is always discipl@@ ine , passion and self @-@ over@@ come .
as what a man have you experienced for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the discussions about her book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve really know as a wonderful , hum@@ oro@@ us@@ ly , hum@@ oro@@ us@@ ly and warm people experienced that it could not imag@@ ine that he could do only a fly slightly .
I come regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ ans still live today , 23 years after his em@@ er@@ iti@@ ation , he will visit him , he is almost blind , and he is almost blind to treat him as a member of their family .
those who are not for@@ given him until today that he was stric@@ tly stric@@ tly to them , so is unique in the min@@ ority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ ans are today d@@ ank@@ able today that he en@@ rich@@ ed their lives and to them the world of music .
and that he always have a good , v@@ ä@@ ful teachers - a str@@ ing@@ ent father , t@@ iss that may be like but even a li@@ able respect of Resp@@ ect@@ sp@@ erson that they have still looking forward to multi@@ ply it .
and , please , even more clearly : all that we have ph@@ asi@@ ze , the education fields that were on the agenda that were on the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long survi@@ ve this time .
but it is really aw@@ ake , a man , only because he is pro@@ min@@ ent , and has an even pro@@ min@@ ent brother to make the MEDI@@ AL@@ EN S@@ ünd@@ en@@ bock .
because it is the evil far@@ ms that is behind it , just all@@ ob@@ viously .
because the report , which was just released , dis@@ charged him .
now , the law would be purchased for a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has bought great appoint@@ ments , and without any of the outside of Bay@@ ern@@ s , and perhaps not yet to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger domain name , finally in peace .
