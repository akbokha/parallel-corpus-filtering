<seg id="79">For the mayor of Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the commune has recognized the significance of the willow project management and is glad about the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers are supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the collaporation of the surfaces might be down even a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the largest treasure we have, they are people who work in agriculture, and thought about how they go on their operation," the mayor of the mayor.</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The first character of a regime change is it when they begin to attach the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans have likewise like any other - and therefore the careful crash of Saddam Hussan came on the Firm in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of Trump regime, knew what he did, as he did a symbolic spreading with Jim Acosta by CNN regarding the suggestions to drastic limitation of legally immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not stay the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators had taught him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular importance to have been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta decide: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to the later, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is sachable properly, but as he formulated it, it is not really around history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It goes around the contemporary resonance of the words of Lazarus, the only in which a state does not include any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your effort to breeds your poor, and the poor out of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to see in the "elabortion" on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller clagates not in the Literary criticism - it was clearly that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider policy and cultural exploitation: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends that seemed to place their words after her death, and knew very good that they had a highly political hand.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and AmericanRepublican demonstrates the female dispersion of liberal disperation of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this significance: in her poem, the female figure no longer abstract - it has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives itself another name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poems with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and an attacking attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Schreihas Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argumentation 2010 that the Statue of Liberty didn't have an early Neocative, but rather transformed the American flame in the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to wear the fackle of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The fackle should not drop the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusually, Limbaugh click here to a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of raising perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus out to see how they had seen by the exhausted, but hoping people after long and often awesome travel on the Decks of Ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in true sense, to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve your life.</seg>
<seg id="125">Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump could not recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Your fackle is not the way to shine, but the hatred, which is the only source of power is not ignited.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when two shallots to the team of Great Britain.</seg>

<seg id="138">What is always the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>

<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their chapters was unbelievable, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of Athleten, no matter whether they live or exercise, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and true feeling, the Eilidh made entirely of course, great was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal, which will compete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m hurdle, says that it is "Impossibly" is that 16 shallots in the british team.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>

<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m running, is another Schotte, one of a great season to observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of their first world championships as the only other sholotte in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">In fact, it says that "enormously proudly proudly" to the fact that many of their countrymen not only belong to the team, but in some cases even at the medals and in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special team captain has been in fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour for me, but I have chosen me to make me something special for me," added it to something. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the beots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are as well established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podium.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only missed that we have very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to place this home support and benefit to benefit that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocks from critics on Facebook: maintains not to bear a public office when you can't bear the heat of sorties.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers took him because of the inner policy until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He schimited with criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not brought his critics to swiss.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the year 1783, Washington said: "the defective quality can be taken away - and, duck and silent, we are led as the sheep for the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Gouverneur Larry Hogan who have to work more as Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans people saw the contributions from at least 450 persons and deleted its opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union missed him due to the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The stick of Gouverneurs therefore dismissed the complaint as friction, and the online comment was fully equipped with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state, who is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the Nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has a fixed hand at the lead of his state and close approaches of principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also sent to use Facebook as primary funds to use with its voters and playful head to chemotherapy on its side.</seg>
<seg id="178">So, the blockage of persons who come to the site of Gouverneurs - which is an public forum, which is officially designated and of employees that are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Obtain Amelia Chasse the acts of governed and arguments that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the image of TROLLEN or chambers or rightly filled people, which is low in order online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post office said with some of the most effective people who have been blocked from Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen driver: a teacher, an entrepreneurs and a priest, no drifake.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told, that their comments is respectable and not beneficing.</seg>
<seg id="184">The Bible published the Bible in his post and appelling at Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not tough, but it asked to Hassomiting.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commerciful that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassomiting and other current news," wrote them in the comment field of the news "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I estimate this idea when a number of people taking place on the same subject, then they are used by manages more than a so much collecting deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the people of Gouverneurs as "concentrated spam attack" is called other probably "prince".</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to install a message to blocks a critic block or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's much clean when in former time if you have done the same thing that employees were absent to collect newspapers by critical objective and demonstrators to burn newspapers and demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is just a digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants that he is critical to Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is repaired by Twitter operators who have been blocked from his Twitter Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, the first Amendment, according to US District, James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she was recognized a voters of their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit by the ACLU for its use by Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of a similar ptos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers abandoned between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letes on his leadership.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plant, the Media abinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have been tempted and are finished.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly will actually do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to make information flow on President Trump - including reports from the news medien - in the hope, the boss on a similar course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day, he exhibited a main problem in President Donald Trumps White house, which he repairs: poor information that will conduct into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that would like to flow it - whether on paper or in writing - because the President better decisions would get a good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to repting Trump by causing his mediates.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President of Trumps relationship between decades was back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate applied for an unfair report, it was productive to show him that he was transferred to him," said the former voting rights of Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, Trumps' s' s to hold control, according to six former voting rights officials in it, to ensure that his personal Mediocation has been awarded at a steadily special price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been ever "under control" was smile.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaigns something, what we know not know that Trumps Tweets without their interventions yet contain more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will never know something about the tweets that wasn't sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his people saw it already some times, offger from him, then, their efforts were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevent it that Trump sum has come out.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists in a willow house that emerging in a willow house, always attempting to introduce her own agenda, making their own Agenda from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite with this history - reported in May about the preventures of consultant, President of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Gold.</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react as a volcano on negative press sections, especially such with damaged leaks, and that it can find out to find out this date.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone had a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, gave the deputy Chief of Staff of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch by Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson because of Schikans lasting from an Twitter, or that he was offered no concrete evidence that he expressed himself into the past, or refuge in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly trying to do three months later, the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective managers as Pithus, but Trump is still his pulse self, and his counselors are still in influence.</seg>

<seg id="1481">The Gremium've recorded the work in the past weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under calling with the thing continged people.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller will be widened shape and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN transmitters CNN reported an initial outline of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trumps's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In the US intelligence services, the Kreml. has been mixed in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller is examined, whether they gave birth between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In focus of investigation, several men are to be established in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more drumps private and business environment under the Lupe.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote some weeks ago that the special Investigator Trump personally had personally in the centre, and the prescrib, whether the President of the affair might have disabilities the justice of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main collection of the Grand Jurys is it to check the evidence of possible accidents in possible accidents and decide whether the indictment should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore called to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly, it is switched on if it is greater and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure takes place always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Gremium can also be enabled by the prosecutor to be switched to people under donid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations were exhibited in order to turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meetings, be asked to a testimony in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">You should also provide documents in documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps consultant and vast reward Jared Kushner, as well as his then election of Paul Manafort in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that Mueller will not leave that Mueller should not be teachable in his work, and that he should be necessary to act as soon.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it was not forced to sign that the Grand jury will be on on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the foundation of the Gremies of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new unveiling, the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia Affair as a campaign in his political opponent.</seg>

<seg id="1505">This work but also usually in secret, stressed he.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House is feared any measures to accelerate the work of special tests on "faire" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The earlier FBI CEO James Comey has said three times that was not determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to accept that something was changed, it was in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only been used after Trump of Comey had been unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rausage, guarded against Trump, he would like to disable the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senatsoff, Trump told him a setting of investigations against the then national safety consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands for the study under a large pressure.</seg>

<seg id="1520">The departments was the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polaron and marine research on Wednesday with.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres large colleagues draw from now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice gigantic, the researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people will not come from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">Inspiration of climate change a role in the outbreak of the ice ges, is unclear after research information.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, in total, however, it has a series of unusual merks of ice skins in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, the researchers can be imputed with the warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Now a broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis to date.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelks floating on the sea and is driven by major glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelbaum is located south of South America almost at the top of antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The balance of this silica was the balance of wax and abomiting before some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete closing is there, I writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are also that the Larsen-C Schelcelebrates is in danger of danger because the front edge has never been moved as far as presently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate among the tension and can be broken if at a keypoint a piece abbreaker.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level, since it is swimmed on the water, as much water, how it causes the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the case that glaciers directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the low size, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelcelebrates is nearly 50 000 square kilometers that is the largest whelings of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, at the front part for the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural footage, and is no direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the far retreat since the beginning of the record, confirmed he also.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scienters, whether the Larsen-C Schelks will be back to grow or long-term, and maybe now, he spoke his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researchers led the outbreak of this gigantic ice, do not attributable to climate change, so far as many ice skids of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long time summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the antarctica dipeninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>

<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce from the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was given by two men. he was poured out of his car and 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was gone into his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours with them to fly in Culiacan free.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But for the topic of Valdez, there are virtually anything as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become a bloody battlefields of the country to fill the rivalent fractions here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It is nothing to be shot in Sinaloa every day or more people on the road, or that the cemetery is full of vertified, two-story Mausoleen for drug, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Place for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a card the control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez saw the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not be protecting his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of a interview recorded with Damascus, Lopez, a leader of a rivalent cartons in war with Guzmans.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication can be destroyed the sons, assumed power members of each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was therein, Valdez was not to forced to take part in the assessment of another newspaper that had the same history, to leave the country into its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He did so long survived that his friends and colleagues draw that he would be always there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he graduated with five colleagues at the founding of Riodoce and 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without on the roughbred problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper compacted a reputation for the courageous and honesting reporting, and the advertising were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treating examinations without fear of zenorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they were able to treat stories.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodology received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists to protect the Mexican drugs history, where ever they led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to that he had anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to experience in addition, he said to the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drogenic in Sinaloa "is a way of life, he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to use the task that falls to you as a journalist, either or you play the Dummen.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not want to be asked: "what did you did as many of death... why did you do not say, what did you?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce-Team measures Valdez, the fun bird that was able to curse the friend who was generously with hug and countenance, a teacher, who knew how to survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They confidential on its routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar from the office, go and there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now, I ask them, "was his love to the routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also asked them to ask their own shares in question, as they can stay their work at the best.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you do not want to move with their women, their children to move their clean stores, their secrets, to move drills.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed" said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-adhesive and self locking device.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Keep his own instructors.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it wrong, abb of them.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The Trouble is said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be heard... and then is the thing with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say in Sinaloa no more - the same as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic blend of lukratives smuggluten, weak institutions and corrupt government.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changed continuously.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training; were suddenly no phones allowed. days earlier, Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the National Government to protect the offices from Riodology in a four-story building in a mid-class area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in March, some of the reporter asked whether they belong to the 50 percent of the policemen that governed themselves as non-confidence.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drops of factories are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce attracted three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the national coup, which focused on the hometown of Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office, an unloading.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word which was to pass, or as it was happened, so it was that time, so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite place of drug aders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politkers, who governed the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI Governors were accused of corruption for corruption of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked to write the reporter of this localities in this locality, including one, in whom a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went into a military accident.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier readers the column of Valdez took the best informational source about the release.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previous, what happens, what happened in Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "with its slender.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was devoted to storage for signs and stickers that has been devoted against the Morde of journalists protest because they have never been expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporterin Miriam Ramirez, a few characters and went to a demonstration on a demonstration for a further journalist to the Office of the Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez were killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burning body has been discovered and civil servants, based on DNA tests that it is.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all country, journalists become more stronger, causing them in organic protest "SOS Press" are written in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day the director Bojorquez moved to Washington and attempted to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on day after the assassination of Valdez defatted Ramirez, the authorities, excreting the journalists, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that they once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that their wormness has injured their objects.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had to be repeated that journalists killed in Mexico from organised crimes including government officials and a constant society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism, he wrote that Reporter cannot be killed by drug subjects, but also on the order of politicians and security forces, who had organised crimes under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" has passed over half of the attacks to journalists from the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because it would like to think the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>

<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and observe the streets and seek after dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are gedly, as it manifested to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used Targets to soaking his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At the first sight, it looks like a statue, even though a shockness.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible nashage of an Canadian Bergarers were so well preserved that experts have been described as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they were able to convince the skin of reddish brown, and they said, they have had some of a "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report presented in the magazine "Current Biology," it was found him as "awarded the Dinosaurs, who ever found ever found, and one of the best Dinosaurs of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurs, who lived in the middle of the chalk-time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Its unbelievable good condition has researchers that describe it as "really remarkable" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant remains the best preserved Fossil in its way.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn radio, when he was in Suncor Millenium, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met a little bit what about the baked Rock fails at the Platze, and decided to draw.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him discovered the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years, the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are just a little with eyes blind, could you think almost believe that it has been slaughter," said the main writer Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will be in the science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved Dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant faulers, although it is covered with a Armor, and it is resembles by the carnivoy Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly paved Dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, to hide themselves, and used a screenings, which is known as counterfattung, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been possible to mix well in its surroundings and to ensure that, experts, that it indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs created in May for the first time and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studying the wild animals and it is called Boreopelta markmitchelli after the museum's Museum Mark Mitchell, one of a team that have more than 7.000 hours to be carefully pouring it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the copy of Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of shoppen and armorations regarding his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the conschatyk, a widespread defence method in animal kingdom, what means that the tip of the creature darker was as their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the conception is common, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Boreopelta, far more animals survivors.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of enough pressure due to flesh fadress Dinosaurs, that the Evolution is the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of these contemporary animals - remember to Rise, Zebras or Gürteltiere - are much smaller and violated as a prey, what signalizes that this Nodosaurs was to survive a real battle.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong preanimal behavior on a massive, strongly paved dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs breasts of the crafty had to have been" said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic connections in their skills also shows that the skin of the Dinosauriers is red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists investigates still the animal on criticing on his life, including his conservatory Darminent to find out what it has eaten it as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the Dinosaurs, as he died in a river, and went into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was so warm like the south-fleas today, and rivers and oceans probably have a lot more growing than they today are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because he is fully covered with preserved grilled skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal reserves," said brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the beast is almost the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use imagination to reconstruct it. if you're only a little with eyes, could you think almost believe that he is at sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The craytime was a time as a huge Therpodes, fleeing Dinosauriere, which stood on two legs, and the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, million years after Boreopelta, the paved Dinosaurs became imprisoned by some of his furchill.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Along with the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, whose latest findings in the journal current biology will believe that Boreopelta moved to death in the sea and in the mud'mumta.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born in Suncor Millenium, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, the preserved Dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armament, and is completely from the snout to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long points that made by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant fauled through the Western Canada, until a flooded river it was built into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater purification of the dinosauriers preserve its response in exquisitem detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The stone remains of this special copy are so good to cover the howage even more pright armoist along the dinosauriers</seg>
<seg id="1966">How Michael Greshko is written for National Geographic, is such a level of preservation 'rarely like a profit in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">If I love it, the destal turns it.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The stone residue of the skin always cover the holed tank plates which wear the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">Its right front foot is on its site, its five fingers are spread on the top.</seg>

<seg id="2060">A question occurred in the sense: "will you have documented or tries to find a story that you can use a story?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This Skepsis was more nourished by countless cases of humans often - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance to their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Such as folayan recently declared in an interview, "we had heard that people who have grown in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis together with an artist from the area that is known for its activism to Todestrakt insurers.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns ershifts.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not a man who speaks for us or with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main cause for me how these people are displayed, because I will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on plls experience to focus, in order to show the movement "not around a Messiah leader, but for a fellowship," said Folayan - it proved to be the manifested of participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Inconsequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of jeans living like her and her wife marries.</seg>

<seg id="2074">Black, Swan women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>

<seg id="2091">Cold, the theme barely hardly an.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme will also be discussed at our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit Gallery say: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "needs no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite light: "greater sahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While beats that a gallery can benefit more customers in the city, of which the other shops benefit, fear the opponent, that the pedestrian zone is hideed.</seg>
<seg id="2095">The gallery is planned: the gallery is planned on the grounds of the farmhouses, in the 13 directors marketed its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be at the end of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market in the new building - and to the Beda-Platz, with possibility to stand outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many charge stores here are empty - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not a ordinary weekly market, it is so important that our markthalle remains at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because it is offered the stock of fresh, mainly is offered directly from the generators and is obendous inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, charging business in a shopping centre only from larger companies, because the dorm are not portable for a retailers often.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeable same - the cables of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were sent by the artist Heather Dewey Hagborg, made hornaments and hairpin that have been sent out of Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the prospects from the prison Fort Leaves worth where the former intelligence-Analytics had a 35-year-old prison sentence, after they had publicly publicly publicly published over the website Wikileaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resensance (an appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg, whose discipline was established in technology, computer science and art, a transgression and landmark, whose condemnation of Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which could be interpreted with these genomish data, as if any intellectual comment were not only be interpreted, as they can be interpreted and the tough Determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, which was born by Bradley Edward, but has already found more about the identification as wife, was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accents, including six violations of the Spionagegesetz, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her image has been pressed, so very that it was only a single photo, black-white Selfie, in the man is noticeably on a driver seat and a platinblonde Wig carries it with them.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg has just returned from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portrait of strangers from foreveric species as a cigarettle and Kaugum, causing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of it, like these people could look like this people.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time to receive an e-mail from an newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she was conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while they had been in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to join this article, Dewey Hagborg at a press photo of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not present at this time and she could not be photographed at this time, so they took contact with Chelsea, they asked whether they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">In the course of two years, the artist and their induced muse were exchanged several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even had an illustrated by Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Soup Images," who would also convert a future prediction in the President of Cheltendeah, and it would be to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">Obama really is only few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven thousand years in a military court in Kansas, was a arbitrary kind of lucky meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and Starkes, da Donald Trump takes a war against Informations from the government camps and against transferring forces to find new, tweetable ways to find the rigid case that he should fit to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey Hagborg, after the strange of timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, called Manning with their oversized signature, including the "i" in her family name (the "i" in their family name), whose foundation was sex, breed, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is the mitochondale DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoffed, through the relationship of 200 letters (or Nukleotide in the artist) show how amazing similar, at least in biological regard, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people of which hopefully will take place that our genome is not so kitten, who we are and like a genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so they are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a room, is a site from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, how it takes place with a Freisprechtelefon in the hand of the disciplinary Academy of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech in cold, then they won," is it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never smell the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter to tell me," told the artists who greet from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I'm still looking forward if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not been personally seen - as it was done in the comic book - but if it should do it to be done in the middle of the space of the masks, who would like to summarize their own genomic simulation as hordes of protest.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted such as everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), which was written with their genetic Haplogue groups.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I wanted to do it to the wall, but I wanted to feel like a human quantity," said Dewey-Hagborg.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, such as movement, also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-er years old.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years turbulent history of his cosy seat in the river valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a prefixes for historic documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look to the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years," says Wehmut.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relation to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England's exciting time from the Middle Ages to the period of Edward and documented the families who illustrated in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, incoming British artist. Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'dead Men's TEETH and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have written only on the thumb-print on the side of a letter so reacts, who was written by a double agent in the 1700-years, who worked for the James, he says.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received the full access, when the last erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection, use the castle as the starting point to spread over a wider basis into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves the newly built castle, which leaves the farmstead of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a concert that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knighly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The climb of sex robots is real, and we should make us Sorgen</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be verified in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, really.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for the Responsible Robotics) (FRR) a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to noble Sharkey, emeritioned Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield, and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start their rise.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye Color of the robot, its shape of the breast and the type of fingagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people make about it funny, but the company deliver every amount of which, and we will have much more frequent," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuffs have been developed by their inflammable partners that feels warm, feels warm - with conscious human reactions that reaches artificial intelligence through the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robots to fit "and can choose everything to choose from the eye Color of the robot on the shape of the breast-handle up to the type or color of his fingernevers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be more troubled, since many robots make the "personality" that would look like a Stepford-woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuffs have been developed to robots with a silicone foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the Realm ix robot enables to adjust its use to adapt their robots to the properties like the Schüchelty.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are still the true personalities of True Companion's sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," the impression of the Schüchupture and "Wild Wendy" with a "abolic" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has an personality that is possible to describe your personality as well as possible," The website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So like it, what you like? and they don't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day the vote - as much as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be fixed to be fixed on conversation or it can be "in the mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many enjoyable aspects of sex robots - not last because they translate real human relations - but the worthy female properties that is approaching one step on Frigid (called here: widest) Farrah, beautifully invent a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its site, True Companion Roxxxy comes with a VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a VIBRATOR, why can I have any Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robot are not only one feed table or just another sex.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Your birth and their increasing refinement show a little Dunkleres and lowering in our culture, on a return of the equation of Gender Equality on a wish to sex with supportation as optional tension.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most of course, of course, no sex robot, and during the FRR, their rising popularity will remain provisionally at the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what from the Randzons, can live in regard to the Spirit of the time, in which we live, very taught.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or besieged, until them the free market will be used for permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain exceeding, that this highly developed sex robot in a period in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a President that means that the women have been attacked to have sexual attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The awesome aspect of the television series' The handimaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphic pictures that works for the bodies of the body, but as realistic this vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to the actual women such as technically possible (even with pnostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">They want to know that they feel beyful to make the movement of a real baspers.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But it is brought to the point when it comes to personalities, the robots have no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not split out of her companion or simply away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They don't have any transmission or background its background, nothing to say anything on independence or anything, what could imagination the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Differently, you are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to make it in the redesign of 2017: services</seg>
<seg id="2424">Drumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the judgment of the healthy son of lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is to become a Binsenweishness of the Trump era that have become a political donations that have the US voters - have also spread families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankyfest gave it in the United States newspapers by Advice on the USA, how to continue with the Horror of Trump sum.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We strict all allegedly to make our filter jackets.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this, because my cousin, a linksduster, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republican in our family, who visited this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">Remember that the unity against a common enemy has a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone, who knows them, including the republian relationship, with which she had struggled because of politics, suddenly and completely constrictly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also provides significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The linke was strengthened by Trump, but the impact of his Presidency has the power to shoot us all after the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruseliness that we will not be more aborted to a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a higher-time scenario, in the Trump Republican of the right wing "normalized" that suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards suddenly compared to his standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find my dozen of a active nostalgia for Mitt Romney - the dog on the car or the dog on the car, which was 14% committal tax (but at least did we see how its tax statement looked) - both in comparison to trump in fact a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump returns, the next candidate of the Republicans must be healthy healthy to qualify as unworthy improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel in the New York City department, and the best three dollars that you have no caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all Clowns are knocked, and the animals turn to look at full of their own shoulders - extremely Finnish and worst music.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many blades of a city of a city: the views of high buildings are familiar, the Skylines will be familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five and thirty years later, and I am still quite more about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topics pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a weird magical experience, as two two-year old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-er years, and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I would have to rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately, nobody has been asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could draw my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee-house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to buy the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy a little over the cargo.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not lead to a slowing of what is actually a neutral replacement, but does not work on the server to use personality in a situation which is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood up, while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistol with breast pain from jail to the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="2455">The citizenship have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say too.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Court said that they will be performing at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection was to be heard in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistol's risk is a danger that its penalty is increased to 15 years when the citizen are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How does the software update instead?</seg>
<seg id="2492">What do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars offered.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emissions behavior of cars of emission categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or bad are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanine of ACE Auto Club Europe are Evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the full software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory update previously apply only for the vehicles which have Schumann's software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has ordered the KRAFTFAHRT Federal Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and from when, customers will be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturer have announced a generous implementation in the next months, but still no more accurate date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed, each person concerned every person.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If it is due in a inspection, it will be disposed in their frame in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long is the upgradations go down to a total?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," thought about Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The curtains of engagement of the manufacturers as well as of political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, voluntarily surrendered to the car manufacturers at the environment of the environment."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-proof could be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do motorcyclists that drive no car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">ACE is waiting for waiting.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably you thought of foreign manufacturers, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Are a massive retail price of Euro-4 cars?</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable applicants are however rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work will always have fun games like it in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">It reports from varied, but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, that date, no candidate cannot fill the required profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for next possible time a architects or civil engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus - under observation of the regular cancellation policy - even enough for a integration.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was to serve as an submit authority as the Lower Saxony authorities, the applicant authority must be associated with the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city to any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not fill out this non-fill the citizens to consulting until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But bourgeernäous is the city and as important, says Wacker, who reported by a good operating sklima as well as good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, some important projects were collected on the chipper with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city of alive," is he itself throughout the office and its staff.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areals and the low-house parking lot of approximately are arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the Stadionsanization is still on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">It alone has about 1.5 million euros in Beech alone, "If we do it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all we wait great tasks to my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here makes fun. "</seg>

<seg id="2555">With Haslachs own Bauhof and Gärtnerei can be flexibly reacts on multiple reacts.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move much," so Wacker, and the design of the green plants will be mentioned by citizens and visitors often.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town as ensemble is important, it is important to have an eye to have been approved, "when reconstructions are approved, bets the separating city master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Wage does not contributes to the Stadtbaumeister high responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is bauherr, "at the end it runs here over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">When care and coordination can count on long-year staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in existence since ten years, Manfred Schöner (underground) has been in existence since 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor is long, Wacker: "we searching for someone who did not identify the place with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continually, is not important for a good operating climate, but also for the other design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If Roland Wacker would like to prove his studies as a diploma thesis or Bachelor with field of architecture as a diploma thesis or Bachelor of architecture, and have a good skills in the fields of building and design.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The urban development and deployment, construction planning, basic construction work, administration of urban farming, urban operation with building yard and urban building services including a monument protection.</seg>

<seg id="2569">Close to the Tatort there were witnesses of a rosotenes and a bike-driver.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that is far beyond a Lusatistreich," ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch said to APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The or perpetrators had brought themselves in great risk and also endangered the train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">Next to the damage to the engine and the plant, as well as the delay of the rail and the costs for the rail-operation could also come to the valleys of the valleys.</seg>
<seg id="2573">A total of a "significant" sum in total, the speaker said.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were moved on Friday morning again, the railway transport of rail transport was carried out without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten people were morning and morning were morning, two of which were on the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight goods were not covered, but they were delayed.</seg>

<seg id="2578">Isolation and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate, help IBD (flammable intentiment)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can stick for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intentions.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The non-healing state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, caused by Maglicles and bloom, recurring or bloody, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the data usually, meat and dairy products, to avoid their symptoms at the Washingtoner, found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins, immune cells were able to develop immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The introductory researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the Darm patrol to ensure that harmful microscars that are hidden in the food, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are dissolved, inflammation are balanced, dispose of cells are balanced and protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive skin.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may be an anti-inflammatory intentiment.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells in mice comes to carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the bricks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiogas, and the development of a population of cells that is the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">More tryptophan had the mice in their food, the greater than they had more of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He smote that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan rich diet tolerance, less flammable Darmmilieus, when the same system is also with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan attempted to simulated a type of immunotherapy when they had found that a group of study lessons such as cells but had a different group of the same tribe that was not separated, this was not dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It is thought that the difference was to do with the loan of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungzen who normally live in the stomach Darm.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were detected DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species that were found in mice with immunotherapy, but without they were missing.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were moved in a stering environment so that they were not developed a Darmmikrobiom and they were not developed these kind of immunotherapy, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria received the immune system to grow in a liquid and then led small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on an unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed among the tolerances of tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid is cleaned, it proved to be a side product of the Tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as an Indol-3-milic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have the amount of tryptophan in the chuck of the mice, increased the number of such cells around 50 percent, but if the tryptophanphanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and most of us L. reuteri will protect our massages.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It's not known, whether Tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri's cells were able to develop as in mice but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory intentiment.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of this cells is probably something that we would have to promote this cells of inflammation on the inner surface of the Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri had lead to a extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2912">How can you be as his biograph report for this report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask what the name was Georg Ratzinger ever.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Only a minority interests was worth over his PERFEKTIONISMUS and its high emotonality, which led even at any time.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Of course I think any of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced in a worldwide school in a state school, experienced in a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with which it's actually, in this report, namely in this report, namely sexual abuse and the certainty on the preschool, are the freesti Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is no more, whether it's not more with his confess and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI, that many media is just overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope, yea, many who have never understood him.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the Truth is: the Georg Ratzinger Report in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report was very much about abuse on the subject of abuse by the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">If Georg Ratzinger will also be done any refuge or co-impregnancy in regard to sexual abuse on sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overhandles are familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never hered me to speak with my father or my mother about it, said a person concerned for the others," It was all very good. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the reconnaissance of sexual abuse, yet it is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not be confidols, then did not believe me in a choral conductors who have been practiced a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to rate the Domspans student Ratzingers role in regard to the abuse of misuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionably student formulated so: "regarding sexual abuse... do not a case where he would have had done in which he could have been resolved in the perpetrators and the respective valleys.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd, to accept that... Bubble inurgent or clear or rather opened, when compared to their parents, Internet, confidentifying etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one can do with him about sex... - undary bar. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report on the very clear result: "that concerned him in the field of the previous pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is of every monsters of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So you can't be discarded him, neither prevents him or to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good names with these contingent crime in combination, as it is unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, much of "Gewalteczessen was to read at the Regensburger domain.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look at the report "in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he do with this plan?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting period, and miss it became a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, somewhere in the middle of dron, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But it is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">As well as clean separately: between the preschool and high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once again, rest of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report emergencies from the time since 1945, so that Georg Ratzinger did not conduct the choir of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All terrible test pedagogic, cases in which the hubs of sadistal teachers were regulated and including underlying, at the school-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to marvated.</seg>
<seg id="2953">Yet with which Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only until her face, when they had already been on the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On which was, as the most common witnesses, the theme "Preschool" Taboo. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "para's" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnal?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was no discipline, but there is no hardistal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report comes to the end, "many victims of the general humanity by R. estimates and therefore even more positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So most of the spring remains too bad.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could be defining only two periods, in which it was reported from the states of the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he had just established itself, and was responsible for the intages at a school, he was not effective and responsible, (so the witness) was not to hear, and then it was released again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Encryption Georg Ratzinger before the states of consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In therein, he indicates that, "that in the school, the test penalty will be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already recognised the danger of negative press release he urgent insight.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time, as legal clarity, as testing drives also in Bavaria had been banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">However, in a right gravel zone, such as every one of us are still know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult to estimate for him, where the affected may exceeded the exaggerated or dramateur and where the allowed limit exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he could always be gone.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is easy to do.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the Trial Chamber was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that's unfair, today's educational shows at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak the historian of the "Fallstrick of the Anachronism," so the danger of understanding according to today's moral measure.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Because the princes has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, which was absent to all times, and not for that time in the preschool education and violence against unfatal childhood, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm glad that it is finally processed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its mean to discipline and punishment, so ear to move to hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment then was forbidden, he has banned this strict.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger for the discussions with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the theme test for reference to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book it is the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as played the domain name only a side wheel.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not know about that he led there a strictest regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said once again: without these PERFEKTIONISMUS, without any unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to form a institution of cattrang and his musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, there is no big singer and no major singer and before each success, in which the territory is always discipline, passion and self-overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what a man have you experienced for Georg Ratzinger at the discussions about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I've really know as a wonderful, humorously, humorously and warm people experienced that it could not imagine that he could do only a fly slightly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I come regularly with how many former Domspans still live today, 23 years after his emeritiation, he will visit him, he is almost blind, and he is almost blind to treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who are not forgiven him until today that he was strictly strictly to them, so is unique in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspans are today dankable today that he enriched their lives and to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always have a good, väful teachers - a stringent father, tiss that may be like but even a liable respect of Respectsperson that they have still looking forward to multiply it.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, please, even more clearly: all that we have phasize, the education fields that were on the agenda that were on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long survive this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is really awake, a man, only because he is prominent, and has an even prominent brother to make the MEDIALEN Sündenbock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Because it is the evil farms that is behind it, just allobviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now, the law would be purchased for a 93-year-old man who has bought great appointments, and without any of the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps not yet to know the Regensburger domain name, finally in peace.</seg>
