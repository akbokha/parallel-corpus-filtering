Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are convinc@@ ed .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa he sought Bernhard Lang@@ er with some colle@@ ague a bit version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after some minutes he re@@ mem@@ bered the horses in her celeb@@ rations , she was in the fast Gal@@ lop at home to the food ar@@ ches .
a kilometre near this tem@@ po , I have an@@ xi@@ ety .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the riding k@@ arri@@ ere then ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best golf course of all times - 101 tournaments - again close by horses .
he left his family with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse sw@@ ore to cover it .
it was the first time in Aachen and thus even at CHI@@ O .
the reason was very convinc@@ ing .
the German sports aid exceeded the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small g@@ ala wood pyramid .
there is no awards for awards in the s@@ ymp@@ ath@@ etic athletes .
Federal Cross , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already been ad@@ orn@@ ed him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports p@@ iles .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this hon@@ oring me very much , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for them is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er has been promot@@ ed to off@@ spring .
and thus he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euros .
with 15 more outstanding sports players , the two @-@ times winner was taken on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the selection , the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ls and Harald Schm@@ itt , the Tur@@ ner Eberhard Gi@@ enger , Alexander P@@ usch , and Ar@@ nd Schm@@ itt , der Jud@@ ok@@ a Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jump@@ ing Al@@ win sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and post@@ h@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wh@@ ale .
many of these sport@@ le@@ es were come on Saturday to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustrations illustr@@ ates the illustrations in jump@@ ing stadium , where the Lav@@ azz@@ a price ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept a distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest@@ ing in infrastructure and trade agreements TT@@ P - that want to convert both Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presid@@ ential compet@@ itors are however on the control and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences between the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philos@@ oph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the dou@@ bt rather small and war@@ ned , as the state of the economy can be har@@ m - with taxes and regulation .
Clinton w@@ olle the economy to death and tre@@ ble to death , he says .
in contrast , he would be different , claims Tr@@ ump .
he will return to regulation , and he makes itself for an extensive tax reform , significantly - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , says : the state has certain tasks to meet , he has re@@ open the opportunities and needs money .
therefore , the tax would be raised for the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the m@@ oul@@ ds , Tr@@ ump , and Clinton is almost similar .
the democ@@ ratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democ@@ ratic polit@@ ics and are den@@ ied from the state of the Republi@@ can Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
so Tr@@ ump could be able to increase internal discussion .
distinc@@ t are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump int@@ ends to build coal plants and expand the coal for the USA in the USA .
to date , oil promotion is also possible to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection .
in Clinton , Clinton wants to extend the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es and calls : &quot; a country will create the super@@ int@@ es of clean energi@@ es and million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two compet@@ itors are not too far away from each other .
in the T@@ PP , the mean trading company , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the USA do not want to isol@@ ate international trading - but just just American jobs are better .
that should be better to get better , calls approximately Clinton .
the current minimum w@@ age of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine w@@ age .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump should do this question , is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum w@@ age must be , then he says , he shall not be changed .
but the great discussion of the next months is likely to develop more to the control policy of the two camps .
on the one side , Tr@@ ump , the economy and the citi@@ zen consum@@ ed to sp@@ ur growth .
his crit@@ ics keep it before that the household defic@@ it would be even larger .
on the other side , Clinton at least made from the rich in fact that they will pay more taxes , and their crit@@ ics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every ge@@ ing woman has experience with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who fle@@ e alone almost all day .
if they come in Germany , they often have been conf@@ ident .
a house offers ref@@ uge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has its small son in the arm .
it looks back with great eyes and cu@@ ri@@ ous in the room .
its mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they noted that it is observed .
they sm@@ iled shortly and k@@ iss@@ es the little ones .
the scene is normal .
to buy with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs from Con@@ dro@@ bs , a support for social aid activities in Bavaria , and deals with the theme women on the flight .
four women in the kitchen are po@@ ol@@ ated .
they live in the north of the north in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ al accommodations for rent women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs , the device was made together with Pro Fam@@ ilia and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ancer .
un@@ longest , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men there is no - even as visitors .
the exception is a Wach@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : each woman who comes here to their escape with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; Men &apos;s because of w@@ ars because they had been pursu@@ ed because of them or death or death , or because their families are called her as hope to Europe , &quot; told them . &quot;
in women weig@@ h other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ als Him@@ self because they see any other ways . &quot;
in their hom@@ eland they have experience with sexual violence , fashion , honor of honor , s@@ la@@ very , or Zw@@ ang@@ ential Beli@@ al .
this makes it out .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that t@@ ugs for a bottle of water an sexual action , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , tells B@@ ahr .
there would also be seen here too many women in the refuge@@ e camp often as a decrease and wor@@ se if used .
this leads to that about 90 per cent of women who live in the Munich accommodation in the northern part of the north .
&quot; some of the children are saf@@ ely rendered volun@@ tar@@ ily . &quot;
many women be so certain that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they trust not to speak about the experience , because the sh@@ ame is too big . &quot;
since they often do not help to help you need more accommodation only for them , the haz@@ ard .
in Bavaria , the seven District govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they are similar to a similar project such as in Munich in their compet@@ ent field , answer some with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are something so something in shel@@ ters of govern@@ ments .
in local alone women , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spok@@ es@@ man , and press spok@@ es@@ person in the government alone .
in Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken there are available in some common floors or own houses only for all women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern where there are two central units exclusively for women .
also the Committee of Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament , that women must be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
in a study that was published for the Committee , it is very important that men and women are split separately . &quot;
&quot; is missing the privacy or men and women together , it can be de@@ voted to - research violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be split separately and for women easily accessible , in the study .
as much as the women of these protective need@@ y , you can find them at the And@@ ur@@ b@@ ind that there is in Munich to the house in Munich .
&quot; since himself has said that there is us , we have a long waiting list , says B@@ ahr .
it could easily be a second house .
assi@@ sts : recei@@ v@@ ables : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new jobs
Dep@@ uty of the assi@@ st@@ ness of the assistant have called their trade union in their dis@@ p@@ utes with their dis@@ p@@ utes of a new treat@@ y .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire Council as from the beginning of September more working aspects .
the J@@ DC said that it was minister to the agreement on the sor@@ rows in mind .
assistant and Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ud@@ ents have been coordin@@ ated on the basis of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rej@@ ected by 58 % of his members who voted the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained qui@@ et@@ ly quiet &quot; to problems that the contract was rej@@ ected .
she said , &quot; In addition , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to the proposed new treat@@ y to complete the proposed contract and official re@@ plac@@ ements to all races . &quot;
as a answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has been given a form@@ al application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to provide a running program with a running program that starts at the beginning of September .
the dis@@ p@@ utes led that assi@@ sts that assi@@ sts this year is six@@ teen , the first total acc@@ id@@ ents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistant Professor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election for rej@@ ection of the agreed contrac@@ tual conditions that has been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he divided the BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assistant and medical equipment , that the contract was benef@@ ic@@ ial and assumed that the contract should be benef@@ ic@@ ial .
after the vote of the health minister Jerem@@ y Hunt that the contract was introduced in England for doctors in England .
Russia and Turkey : an alli@@ ance of external pages &quot; ?
it was a G@@ este , which ended a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanc@@ tions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot tell me of the Impres@@ sive , that Ankara will not re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation me at most .
there was the craft , yes .
but in sm@@ ile the sm@@ ile , and he radi@@ ant little heat , even for his re@@ turning conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an said to his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times .
I could not count it .
he also said that rel@@ ations@@ hips to Russia is not only return to the old level before the crisis , but even further improve .
on the next day a newspaper that pe@@ as@@ an would have been increased , that would never be something wor@@ st .
I would like to indicate the contr@@ ary to me .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cal@@ mill showed that the State of Russia did not forget .
rather it was the cause of crisis the first , which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory mentioned : the de@@ position of a Russian strug@@ gle on the Syrian border through Turkey .
the reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ tered .
Putin was composed of and accused of Ankara , Russia in the back .
the promise was even bigger because it was celebrated by a local friend .
the bag smo@@ ked back up again if not even impossible to be impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has been wal@@ ked since November .
the state of the state @-@ controlled media have been controlled with un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once more , it would carry the door to bear all the sh@@ ould@@ ers for everything .
at the serious public offici@@ als were benef@@ ited from il@@ leg@@ ations offici@@ als that Erd@@ og@@ ans had benef@@ ited from il@@ leg@@ ed oil trade in areas of Sy@@ ri@@ ens , who received the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he did this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was therefore only instead , because Putin has received the President of the Erd@@ og@@ an that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a tru@@ sted board is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is required in first line all friends that he can get back after the last month at a mist@@ ake almost his am@@ tes .
repeated ter@@ ro@@ rist attacks on Turkey have been resol@@ ved him .
but there are also economical motifs .
in Russian sanc@@ tions , Turkey made hard hard - especially the prohib@@ ition of charter fle@@ ets to bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel organi@@ zers and charter companies will be fac@@ ilit@@ ated when the flights will be res@@ umed .
they count towards a del@@ ight of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week predic@@ ted the state @-@ only fruits of fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural in@@ flows are allowed .
a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ ulated this as follows : &quot; tourists there for long , tomatoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is based on the West , since it was considered the response to the ver@@ ify ma@@ sters as weak response .
for this purpose the out@@ line of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping to go out of the cool s@@ enti@@ ment to draw and the relationship of Turkey to the West Germany .
in Ankara , Russian Chief Apostle won a bonus that he was called for the selected state aid for the selected state aid .
this is a self @-@ thought that itself is a de@@ voted an@@ xi@@ ety before reg@@ im@@ ing itself .
the summit in this glori@@ ous Palace of the sea , Russia and Turkey , one of which once a analys@@ er was once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ sid@@ ers &quot; in two countries that are surrounded by the west and po@@ or@@ ly treated from the West .
nevertheless , despite the public re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation , there are still large differences between the two still .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow was recently given the role of peace than peace , but in Russia and Turkey .
it might be not@@ able that after almost three hours of the first presid@@ ents , both Presid@@ ents on the press conference said that they had not stri@@ ped once .
the President of Turkey dis@@ missed it to a question about their differences , while Putin was elim@@ inated this too .
there is no unique con@@ sens@@ us , where a common g@@ low can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect dis@@ aster , the NATO member of the Russian fighter jet ab@@ sch@@ oss - it certainly better that the two state efs at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Schott@@ lands cannot be available
according to the board R@@ BS , the Bank R@@ BS is to be reduced to a Back@@ office roller from the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Schott@@ lands .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan part of the BBC Scotland who connected the R@@ BS stamp with the global Amb@@ itions of the Bank .
the bank has been re@@ co @-@ financ@@ ed as they had almost 200 years ago , and had to be saved .
in this period , Mark@@ en@@ Strateg@@ ic &quot; R@@ BS &quot; was used to protect other end@@ urance fin@@ als .
they supported the international sport with million pounds of spons@@ oring , from Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon of Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all R@@ s@@ b references , the dec@@ entr@@ alised headquarters and the stock number to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster bench brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private clients who are more importance - Cout@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness Sh@@ ire .
he dep@@ artments of the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the R@@ s@@ b brand will be one of our Invest@@ ors , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed , as we are now more to be trad@@ emar@@ ks of brands . &quot;
when the bank was a global brand , R@@ BS was transferred to the global brand .
I say now that we are no global goals , but local goals .
each of these stamps will work in their own municip@@ alities for something different and our employees are working under these stamps with customers .
R@@ BS has already been said that his Six Nations spons@@ oring not continued even more , and that it will increase the perc@@ eption of the various brands at its Sport spons@@ oring .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop as the bank of the trad@@ emar@@ ks , for how focus we are asked to make us at a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Management Board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ically , when we had said that we had to be a great bank for our customers and these stamps were l@@ anc@@ ies .
but with our work , focus on customer requirements and not our own , think I will see many changes .
we can feel this marks , so I think that the time has come .

Russian Putin made Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expected his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of part of the eng@@ ths of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to special responsibility for environmental and transport .
in a position of the Kre@@ ml , Putin is that Putin without speci@@ fies the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was appointed Ivan@@ ov@@ &apos;s position since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former dipl@@ omat .
he was born in 1972 in the University of Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Rel@@ ations@@ hips ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ ml ( in Russian ) that he was later log@@ ged and Chief of Staff of the Regi@@ stered Office .
concerning his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think that the most important task of the government is to ass@@ ist your activity as the state of the law of the law , and checks regarding the implementation of your instructions .
Putin made the Russian TV transmitter on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov has been asked to leave his mail to leave and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
con@@ vince the sm@@ ile Fac@@ es ?
this step was a myst@@ eri@@ ous living in Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of Vladimir Put@@ ins and works as he works for the Soviet intelligen@@ ce , the K@@ GB .
as a Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the land .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed in Television , claimed both men that the Staff of Staff is back on his own request .
but despite the sm@@ ile for the cameras , there are only few of them convinc@@ es - especially now , shortly before the par@@ liamentary elections .
so is the sequence of a kind of ma@@ stic fight against ?
the white currently no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once charged as a pot@@ ential president , on once the Russian environmental policy would like to take advantage of great sk@@ ep@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , which will be c@@ ited on the site of the Kre@@ ml , told Ivan@@ ov &quot; it is true that I could say that this very comp@@ lic@@ ated post - one could trust this very comp@@ lic@@ ted mail for four years .
as it was out , I &apos;ve been since four years and eight months of President of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ an administration .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before he was Dep@@ uty Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian security Council and Putin was a former member of the State Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990@@ s , as Putin was President of the Bund@@ essi@@ Safety Authority ( FSB ) , the K@@ GB was appointed Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his position .
when Putin took the power in Ivan@@ ov , he called Ivan@@ ov , as one of five people , whom he had confidence .
once discovered that Ivan@@ ov has been adopted according to Put@@ into second term of President of Russia , since a third term of Put@@ n@@ ought against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by a further , seam@@ less al@@ lies put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he was rebuilt three years later again .

the £ 1,35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cross@@ ing with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four concl@@ usions of the &quot; Deck@@ ers &quot; that is completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of concrete .
the £ 1,35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown instead of the building site today a visit from and was one of the first that went out from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbo@@ lic moment during the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of a true art of engineers at this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flu@@ ids between vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge is a hei@@ k@@ le activity , which require an extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge placed on their square and the last section of the Deck@@ s today gets a concrete for the deck which means that the whole deck is ready to be fixed on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge : &quot; the first lock is a significant mil@@ estone in any bridge project .
during this fantastic project , the fe@@ eder @-@ proof high @-@ production and dep@@ ths .
after installation of the last road bars and its connection with the extension of the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the northern or landscape side .
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern region of 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very hot work at the same time .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , approximately 6,000 tons and at an incline of approx . 3 % to be moved to the top .
the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team operates - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately , everything worked very good .

who builds brown d@@ well@@ ings ?
the SPD and green my : invest@@ ors shall be much stronger into the oblig@@ ation .
how re@@ acts on the poor message that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 local apartments ?
the SPD pro@@ poses to the next meeting meeting a &quot; Manu@@ als concept . &quot;
but dis@@ pu@@ te is programmed .
first line goes to question : who should actually build the favor@@ able apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
in the SPD group , Christoph Viola : &quot; we are dedicated to us with the green : who wants to make an urban areas to show future 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments . &quot;
however , the favor@@ able apartments can also be created in the continu@@ ance .
however , the great Ar@@ ph@@ asis in the town hall was however , as the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to build invest@@ ors with invest@@ ors that want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build invest@@ ors on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments . &quot;
a new municipal residential building program that will cost EUR million and is to be financ@@ ed by pressing .
the problem that Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no uni@@ fication between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make a few provisions within invest@@ ors .
the Lin@@ ke will still be ref@@ err@@ ing to invest@@ ors for invest@@ ors .
he became aware of his , viol@@ as , as a flag of the situation in the house market .
the manual concept will be implemented for additional tasks in the administration management .
more staff is required .
it &apos;s un@@ clear if we will receive the professionals .
but the program does not yet see : because the roughly 1260 new apartments that should be built in .
but as it is similar to the loss of more about 1300 favor@@ able apartments whose funding will work in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planned spok@@ es@@ person of Nicole Palm download , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition we have thought to be thought to pick @-@ up , apartments back to the price list .
this is possible in the West city .
to solve this problem on a single blow .
because in the West@@ stadt run the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments there could be back there in the price list for cheap apartments .
only : this will not want the owner , the building companies are not .
because the number of social apartments in the West@@ stadt is increased dra@@ st@@ ically , removed from the goal of the so @-@ called through mixture .
there should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few days .
for the reasons that there will be a movement in the discussion .
party whi@@ p Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke means : &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U has to have the CD@@ U with a boat . &quot;
although they foc@@ used on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not say that not a com@@ promise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting to health and happ@@ iness that can be worth it
it is fas@@ cin@@ ating as the world changed .
that &apos;s teen@@ ager and child to play no longer to outside , but rather it prefer to spend their time to spend their time , on screens up to rigid , was rej@@ ected in the last decade of many cases .
with Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s why to get the sofa of the sofa and more active .
at the time the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video play and last to smart@@ phone .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities in the open air .
I be@@ ats of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app which were created on the characters , which were initially created for the video play in the 1990@@ s ( later created a drawing series , playing cards and other sp@@ in @-@ offs ) .
how many phen@@ om@@ ena the pop culture sank the interest in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries have been post@@ p@@ oned by the massive demand that the server was over@@ loaded .
within less days Pok@@ é@@ mon go more users than T@@ inder and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
just put the player with their smart@@ phones to outside and seek after Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are pursu@@ ed with a GPS as well as soon as they were found , &quot; phot@@ ograph &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; can be captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , he joined the w@@ ahn &apos;s and sp@@ rang the looking for the sofa .
in the USA the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5,000 users had been pursu@@ ed that within two days following the market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent per day , by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company knows not that Pok@@ é@@ mon go Go - it looks only the raw data for the power upgrade .
a lot of public cl@@ ari@@ ans to health , people want to take away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ears , because many public messages to health boring people are and of people come to look .
nevertheless , the meaning of sport could not be re@@ viewed by sport .
those regularly sports , reduces his ch@@ ances to explore cancer or de@@ pres@@ sions .
physical activity helps at the weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages to exec@@ ute it here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon go is that it brings you to do something to do that you have fun .
this way , three pill@@ ars of health covers - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine , and fun .
some people close on the h@@ unt even new friends .
as always there is also m@@ ür@@ rical play@@ der@@ ber that must always have something more than something .
and yes , someone might run against a door .
what should it ?
it is a break@@ through .
even if smart@@ phone Apps than Fit@@ Bit was previously used before our activity follow , they have no reason to play sports , how it does this game done .
the New is los@@ ing his ri@@ z and use the time with the time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ it &apos;s success , there will be more games that will help apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help be to be able to become active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Tur@@ ner in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to multi@@ k@@ amp@@ ft@@ sman@@ ship and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lamp of the Olympic Games .
the total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was unique in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ hei@@ ch@@ amer@@ adin Al@@ y Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Br@@ onz@@ em@@ e@@ alli@@ sts in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
American acti@@ vely in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Brazil on the we@@ aning of Simone B@@ iles turn@@ es at the sw@@ elling company in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil .
B@@ iles is the fourth day of het@@ er@@ osex@@ ual American wins and a total of the fifth , while her rep@@ utation , the best of its generation or even was able to be even at all .
she broke out in te@@ ars , when her end result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success represents the same League like unique athl@@ ets as Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps that brought their sports up to new heights :
B@@ iles spent the last three years its sport watches - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that she said that the Olympic winner in 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on of her said that she has ever seen the best gymn@@ asts that I have ever seen . &quot;
it was an last examination in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t think so much between the b@@ iles and the rest of the Ath@@ l@@ eten , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be dis@@ appo@@ inting as dis@@ appointment .

B@@ iles claimed the first medal on Tuesday , while they were retired at the far@@ ew@@ ell celebration for Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a teacher sign .
although B@@ iles indicated , during their long trail , never planned to have the future , it &apos;s not really true .
a part of their sur@@ ve@@ ys - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin music to the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ ar@@ ena in Rio .
this is not an accident .
this girl , who discovered by their grand@@ parents as a small child adopted and by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a deb@@ uts in the turn@@ around town in Bo@@ or@@ man , became the force in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost multi@@ fac@@ ic@@ ing competition in the summer of 2013 , a seal series which is so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two rotation , tr@@ apped the picture .
Sw@@ eb@@ eb@@ al@@ ken and Bod@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns - in which B@@ iles holds the World Championship title - lau@@ tern .
she secured again with 15,@@ 433 on the sw@@ elling techniques - and set up with a 15.@@ 933 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ arm@@ oured they g@@ ently when she used her En@@ der@@ g@@ atory - a pure form@@ ality - and te@@ ars flow on B@@ iles , red , white and blue Eyeliner , when the vision which was once in their coll@@ ecting design , to reality .
the performance of Ra@@ ism@@ ans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she was f@@ ought for the third place but the bronze age in a z@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man had called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; which is called &quot; Ob@@ serv@@ atory . &quot;
according to their ground contact the audience was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by a com@@ eb@@ ack that appeared sometimes in dou@@ bt .
what is concern@@ ed , so the wor@@ rying twe@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week a very new signific@@ ance :

the val@@ leys eight shots from a de@@ hum@@ id we@@ apon while travelling at the side of the cars and fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police dep@@ artments with that the three sh@@ ould@@ n &apos;t have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not drop the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were found in pos@@ session of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting will lead to the investigation , to be connected with four previous pin att@@ acked .

it is thought to use several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ ans from the late 1990@@ s , a black BMW from the late 1990@@ s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ator ref@@ used to have led the evidence that they are linked to the conclusion , and of the same mort@@ al have been committed .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised due to their inj@@ uries and died later .

mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ ze@@ ph@@ alie : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to das S@@ ingen , Toys , and of course his mother .
but as the least in its age , Edmund Mikro@@ ze@@ ph@@ asis , the result of an gen@@ etic dist@@ ur@@ ising , about the mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregn@@ ancy nothing knew .
when he came home , my first time was my first thought , I create this .
I do not we@@ apon .
I am not left me .
what did not be wrong -- of course you got left out , she said .
her husband &apos;s Vincent and her was informed that Edmund they may never see under circum@@ st@@ ances that he may not survi@@ ve once .
some doctors had even so far so that they might det@@ eri@@ zed him to institu@@ tional .
&quot; my first answer it was &apos; I knew that the people still make it , &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with the help of an help .
Edmund cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t up to his third years , neither cr@@ ashes nor crow@@ ned , and he can still speak .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and biking .
he loves it also to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that is Edmund for &quot; please sing something like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him an arrangement with &quot; , told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical character language -- says it . Edmund has a few characters alone .
Micro@@ ze@@ ph@@ alie has a variety of causes : gen@@ etic like Edmund as well as inf@@ ections with vir@@ uses such as mas@@ ks or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregn@@ ancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary .
it &apos;s still too early as it affects the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ fic@@ ated influ@@ ences .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remin@@ is@@ cent of the em@@ oti@@ onal prize of a true future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t know it .
I have been asked for a long time more after the forecast , because I don &apos;t expect it to say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a ho@@ p@@ ent Rat@@ ings for mot@@ h@@ ers of m@@ amm@@ ation with birth to birth by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; by bul@@ lets , convinc@@ ed shooting in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already won the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the boys of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the big fans showed that brown several sc@@ atter@@ ed viol@@ ations , including in the end , ben@@ ds , arm and b@@ elly , but that he was at the hospital at con@@ sci@@ ousness .
he has made much , his smaller body was out of balls , partially destroyed his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez on the transmitter .
I can not believe that .
the condition of the boys was classified in a hospital as critical and he needed to move several operations .
the boys become part of the transmitter that he is expected to generate back again .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who shot in Germ@@ an@@ town in Germ@@ an@@ town .
there were also three men : two of the ages of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are in stab@@ ilized according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a cars along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which was shot in a critical condition , im@@ posed by the transmitter .
the other two victims were not included in the car and the police , just under one of the last men of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
Er@@ ler part C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it has come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , who have been pursu@@ ed to various assault rif@@ ug@@ es , translated to the facts .
it seems that there is clearly the strug@@ gle for the strug@@ gle .
on the road , located on both sides of the way , H@@ ül@@ sen .
it seems to have been given here several armed fig@@ h@@ ters who were very acti@@ vely involved , &quot; partial police h@@ aut@@ p@@ mann Anth@@ ony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia connected to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the field .
there was no fixed and the police test@@ ified to report the video surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 year @-@ old girl is made by a cross club on arm , when she played in front of her house in the area of the West Oak Lane .
they recover and the police seek after a dam@@ nation .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need
that is what I vor@@ ced in the Gymnast@@ ics Olympics and that is more than a reason .
since 1984 , I joined at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so domin@@ ant .
and second : this team has three turbo inside , Simone b@@ iles , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , who inspired by many young girls from other skin .
the structure of this team , the Al@@ y Ra@@ is@@ man who is J@@ ew K@@ oci@@ an , and Mad@@ ison K@@ oci@@ an , the Cat@@ holic@@ s , abr@@ ands , makes everyone proud .
this team refl@@ ects the USA against the USA .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ an female presence at the top of this sports .
over the last four years the number one was under the female turbo @-@ American maker .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is the strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a sur@@ prising Olympic and America at the last Olympic Games .
now the world was able to be the un@@ believ@@ able performance of the three @-@ fold world championship in Simone B@@ iles , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , as it was un@@ expected , but most preserved Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , het@@ er@@ osex@@ ual American was won with a individual combined events for women in gold .
team member Al@@ y Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we see the top of this sports , but you don &apos;t see a g@@ ym@@ s in all country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie leaves all the same way like Al@@ y and Mad@@ ison to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ is only four turbo inside in the team is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer .
but the reality looks like that &apos;s more expensive sports and tur@@ bo@@ asts can be maintained in the first line in private turn@@ tables , which costs for training , integration , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their turbo and families ) . the list can be changed .

Culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has been removed in Muslim popul@@ arity
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ a for Rah@@ man was removed last year on the office of a government report because of corru@@ ption from the office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that wides@@ pre@@ ad election was ign@@ ited in Muslim municip@@ alities , as a ver@@ itable government report today .
the former cab @-@ board member Sir Eric P@@ ickl@@ es g@@ ains the police , election activities and Rath@@ geber in this way to be ig@@ no@@ red by cho@@ irs to eth@@ never and religion . &quot;
the former min@@ isters for integration and commun@@ al government , who would now be a Ant@@ corru@@ ption of vot@@ ers of religious mot@@ ives so that it should be to protect the police outside of vot@@ ers to protect your vot@@ ers .
he recom@@ men@@ ds that vot@@ ers should result in a reference to prove their identity .
at the time a vot@@ ers have to call its name and address .
the report pro@@ poses that not di@@ visible ink on the fing@@ ers of a person contri@@ bute to prevent them to prevent any one twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for more access to municip@@ alities and dec@@ isions of un@@ official comm@@ itt@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; that is not only against vot@@ er , but also the commun@@ al government remains against the wid@@ est cor@@ p@@ tic and financial culture , that he said , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Intern@@ ship in the Middle East .
last year we decided to take a special selection that the am@@ ental may@@ or of Rah@@ man should be made after a lit@@ ig@@ ei at corru@@ p@@ ten and il@@ legal intern@@ s of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have had the religious fe@@ el@@ ings of his Muslim sort of his mus@@ cles , &quot; and that he would have brought his crit@@ ics with R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ ist debt .
Rah@@ man should have to be led to the basis of the foundation that it is the re@@ lig@@ ous oblig@@ ation of Mus@@ li@@ ms to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 parts were either a dou@@ bt or the result of a replica , when one person had chosen other .
Sir Eric told that it was in the whole country of evidence for Sc@@ am .
he expressed in particular al@@ arm@@ oring to the em@@ oti@@ onal election - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people who chose the candidates of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to so@@ w the vot@@ ers to prove the identity system to prove the identity .
in its report it is called &quot; as proof : &quot; as proof has been attri@@ buted to Privacy members of ethnic min@@ orities , especially women and young people to choose according to the welcome of the el@@ derly people , in particular comm@@ unities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ y background .
&quot; there were concern@@ s that ... state institutions are such a behavi@@ or due to &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; sens@@ iti@@ v@@ ities regarding the eth@@ ane and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to so@@ w the system , including the prohib@@ ition that political activ@@ ist letters were made to stop &quot; elect@@ oral selection . &quot;
the report , written by Th@@ eresa May in revi@@ val , also the toug@@ h registration tests to prevent that the voting list is used to immig@@ ration and social service purposes .
options in to draw , vot@@ ers before your choice according to your identification .
not ready ink on the finger as soon as they have given their voice to prevent that one twice cho@@ oses twice .
system@@ atic exam@@ inations about the nationality of a person who are entitled to ensure that they are entitled to be entitled .
a three @-@ year limit on entries on a automatic paper selection .
prohib@@ ition against political acti@@ vi@@ sts complete the elections and envelop@@ es of letters .
the police , give the police to set off by elect@@ oral g@@ ym@@ s .
a law change that an indictment due to limitation due to the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ representatives Act 1983 ) fac@@ ilit@@ ates .
photographer photograph@@ ed in vot@@ ers stations .
requirements that only be used in the elect@@ oral stations ( except of Wales ) .
intensive training of train@@ ings to ensure that employees are usually going to set the vot@@ ers alone in the elect@@ oral body .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolit@@ an Police and takes place it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s case was not den@@ ied .
the voting Court opened Lut@@ man and his position as an un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable prac@@ tices on behalf of a lit@@ ig@@ ei and il@@ legal intern@@ als . &quot; he said , &quot;
he was found guilty due to a range of reasons for reasons - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings - guilty .
he crit@@ ic@@ ed the real &quot; waste checks &quot; of the vot@@ ers dep@@ artments of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said , &quot; The court sur@@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
our country contri@@ butes to the mother of the Par@@ li@@ aments of a St@@ ol@@ zes heritage , but the conf@@ usion of vot@@ ers and dis@@ cover@@ ies of vot@@ ers and den@@ ied authorities in fav@@ our of this good rep@@ utation .

if you don &apos;t turn away from the back , then you should see her att@@ ack@@ ers , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the we@@ apon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows into your face .
then suggest him sod@@ ann with the kne@@ es in the light@@ est and turn before pain , the we@@ apon of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move it back to him while the we@@ apon .
in att@@ acking , the technology is similar to the front , the technology is similar to move your body from the Line of Fire , take the we@@ apon and dec@@ lining them that the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot .
just put the weight on the we@@ apon and beat the att@@ aching button on the chest , then turn the we@@ apon from his handle before they move the we@@ apon and the we@@ apon .
does not difficult ?

rice Ian W@@ right is right for a guide of the tongue of the dir@@ ty locations in Europe
a British travel under@@ went imm@@ une system and wor@@ th@@ ef@@ lex of a serious examination - by some of the dir@@ ti@@ eth and most poll@@ uted places of Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and it@@ aut@@ or Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk ew@@ ays his traction on a Euro @-@ string , a pur@@ ge of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to represent the resistance of its imm@@ une system .
before reading any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show themselves and show us , on what he will rise .
but the experim@@ ent that under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was fil@@ med with some sur@@ prising results .
the thought to cover the rins@@ ing of a train toilet , which was already entirely im@@ per@@ vious to im@@ per@@ vious , but actually , in a kitchen unit more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical consult@@ ations relating to the funding of Dar@@ mb@@ ac@@ ter@@ ies , as well as his own health .
fortunately , not left what he den@@ ied , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr W@@ right is known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by giving the world travel@@ ed and stand @-@ like as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to rin@@ se of toilets , the task exhibited his imm@@ une system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child was relatively un@@ occupied , what my health is concern@@ ed and I have turned all possible things in my mouth , earth , saus@@ age and mu@@ d . &quot;
in the movie , he was rep@@ aired for his call .
the only thing which he rej@@ ected , a tast@@ y public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed an Lumin@@ omet@@ ric number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ance number is fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he ref@@ used to ref@@ use its lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travelling film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; that shows the bacter@@ ial number of different locations like the bathroom
in the movie , he says : &quot; that &apos;s the wor@@ st , what I have ger@@ ed in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will tell us here , because it is here outside .
&quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company will be held Mr. W@@ right with valid@@ ated valid@@ ates as well as vitamin C and D , to support the funding of Dar@@ mb@@ ac@@ ies and the imm@@ une system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer goods for some new products .
something that explains the fas@@ cin@@ ating to see and simultaneously the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led the cra@@ zy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by that we said , &quot; Let &apos;s Ian call us . &quot;
they claim that the interest in int@@ est@@ inal health is known to a global phen@@ om@@ enon
instead of only about the products , we wanted to present them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our daily surroundings , the meaning of the int@@ est@@ inal health and how it is linked to the imm@@ une system .
the growing interest in the int@@ est@@ inal health is a global phen@@ om@@ enon in the documentary , we were able to provide consumers more information on an interesting type and fashion .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , I added me so say - I would have done my respect for Ian , when he would have done some of things that I have seen him as the ek@@ el@@ ming Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course , it was easier to bring it to them , Ian along with them to win them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad that we recorded some of these tast@@ y paintings to film . &quot;
in a valid@@ ated survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria were included in particular with the wel@@ fare of stomach and Dar@@ m and 58 percent said that they contain at least occas@@ i@@ onally products that contain both lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern : &quot; first , where there are we@@ ht@@ ly &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern : the loc@@ als will not get nothing of the summer elections with the holiday of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia in the country of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern they underst@@ ood them .
in 2021 the Parliament election does not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sever@@ ely par@@ liament decided at the beginning of the year .
because he is not so far : summer holidays , heat and landing point fight - it is not so far .
the loc@@ als who f@@ ought in the election of the election , are on holiday .
the most common holiday , which are in the country , Us@@ edom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , no loc@@ als , may not choose the Parliament .
this includes practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters are spread , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , Flyer split and at the end of the vote , only eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly .
until September 4th , 2016 , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern has to leave once the voting for bar@@ ely on the people over the people .
the hot phase , if one can say it , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U co@@ alition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , which has been the stron@@ gest party since 1998 , is clearly sur@@ ve@@ ys behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is cuts how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D ab@@ and@@ oned and what at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ary remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government leaders , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive election campaign , see one of his large posters .
he travels the country , distributed in Ros@@ en and is a little with people , as it was even as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise sail@@ ing cold feet , and the Chancellor Angela Merkel will receive the scho@@ ol@@ d on the blood of the Af@@ D .
your refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; We create the Asc@@ ension of the Right op@@ uli@@ sts , what is now probably the beautiful ministry is now .
the CD@@ U with its po@@ ros@@ ary data , the Interior Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced , as it is , if you &apos;re going to be a wrong time on the right place .
she invited twice the German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Angela Merkel at the North East .
but the target group did not agre@@ e to North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen as M@@ eckl@@ enburger and Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other states , &quot; kl@@ ag@@ te Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern , recently in N@@ DR .
but there is also none to listen to the other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the northern East CD@@ U are largely based on market conditions and shopping centers with sun umbre@@ ll@@ as and air@@ bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , the gu@@ ard@@ ed gu@@ ard@@ ed , plays only one &quot; lower role . &quot;
the Union also resulted in the land that its base is br@@ ittle , that they must be very serious , and to find an wire to the men again .
you are like the Left , the SPD , the green : in the walls of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U election campaign is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ous : &quot; you must go , where there are we@@ ht@@ est , nam@@ ely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly eng@@ ag@@ ated election campaign .
in in@@ qu@@ eries , S &amp; D Euro MP@@ s have at least 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ ter@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD had already won clear with 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the in@@ qu@@ eries added to the leap in the country .
they make a modern T@@ ug@@ h in the holidays of emergency a modern T@@ ug@@ ging and maintain their election to the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is called the president of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green vot@@ ers fig@@ h@@ ters on track search@@ ing for indi@@ gen@@ ous ab@@ str@@ ate among the holiday .
Silke G@@ aj@@ ek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ eckl@@ au@@ burg@@ ische lakes and fin@@ ds it even nice .
your impressions : &quot; election of Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern is no penalty . &quot;

since the construction site on Monday to the south and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was re@@ constructed and also the connection to R@@ ott@@ enburg has been relax@@ ed in the traffic position inside the place .
the citi@@ zen may now proceed from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the out@@ come by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant compl@@ aints , &quot; says the responsible Management of the renovation of the renovation of the renovation of the capital of Florian King .
the arri@@ ves of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Schlei@@ ch@@ ways are su@@ stained and more their sat than the signs .
what was led that some trucks in the most con@@ servation areas .
since then the speed limit will not be observed , called the municipality strengthened the knife from Mö@@ ss@@ ingen .
&quot; there were significant super@@ vision , &quot; says King , which made yourself about the place about the situation .
there are already two to three per minute .
the high @-@ speed driver was on the road with 77 tr@@ und@@ il@@ omet@@ res in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it has become a quiet .
for busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small tro@@ st that for customers from R@@ ott@@ enburg now open the road again .
in the cards , the busin@@ ess@@ men should not look like .
but that the B 27 @-@ restoration work carried out at them at net fr@@ ac@@ tures , everyone who as@@ ks are asked to look .
however , some more and some less is affected .
those who produced with the &quot; End@@ ers &quot; less to do so for other firms , which has hardly ever consequences .
also at the car park Ma@@ ier speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; maximum slight decrease , &quot; sp@@ ati@@ al , but naturally &quot; the mileage is missing . &quot;
at the stron@@ gest building the local district is along the stron@@ gest .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , is clear words .
this is already existing re@@ at@@ ened .
not only him , but all host@@ ilities have made it &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customer from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ er .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
the turnover is tar@@ get@@ ed to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the road restoration have been dis@@ card@@ ed his operation &quot; around two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of its staff .
if I would have had a company with 4000 employees and would have had been re@@ act , the policy would have been re@@ act .
instead of government President Jörg Schmidt on a request of g@@ öh@@ ner , whether it would have benef@@ ic@@ ing a financial advis@@ er , with the reference to the advantages at the B 27 . now also the dis@@ advantages of the advantages that carry out by the re@@ hab@@ itation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land circuits , where something was gener@@ ous .
in all coll@@ ages , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its guest house will continue .
finally , the family business has been based on the long history since 1715 it refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now pre@@ vent@@ ed because of the comp@@ lic@@ ated traffic in less often , it can understand .
if you cannot come , it is also really nice .
after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner did not return any dou@@ bt .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction works for its biggest crisis that experienced its guest house in its long history .
six months of construction , that is brut@@ ally .
constantly is ste@@ pped in the name of ter@@ ror@@ ism in the name of ter@@ ror@@ ism .
following the recent attacks of Interior , Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick@@ er security package .
but what has a Dul@@ pt status with ter@@ ror ?
and what says the code partner to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is the re@@ conc@@ iled .
all his propos@@ als be polit@@ ically split &quot; polit@@ ics &quot; says the Federal Minister of Defense in the presentation of his new security sp@@ ets .
they require none .
other , further points would be discussed within the parties within the parties .
I also participate in this too .
but the Minister of Interior is to be found him on results and in a &quot; e@@ vid@@ ent con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the co@@ alition .
following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach a little time , before he presented his concl@@ usions for the Security in the Republic of Germany .
but the fall of them now exp@@ ose down .
one is already known , announced that : a new Security authorities is to take care of the cr@@ ack encry@@ pted communication , is not new .
also not the fact that Germany has to set several EU direc@@ tives on flight information and tru@@ ce .
the call after more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
for the part starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère one second att@@ empt for suggest@@ ions that previously appeared with the SPD : he wants to make Sym@@ pat@@ hi@@ ew@@ er@@ bung for ter@@ ror@@ ism under pun@@ ishment and j@@ ih@@ adi@@ sts with double citi@@ zens@@ hip in the German Pass .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; sp@@ ati@@ al the CD@@ U man .
he can still play for mostly and challenging , what@@ so@@ ever during co@@ ag@@ al partners are no od@@ ds .
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ ici@@ ère .
there are partly in itself : he is planning quick procedure for dis@@ cover@@ ings and more possibilities for in@@ refer@@ ing human be@@ ings in front of departure .
refugees who are tar@@ get@@ ed into the country , to make their smart@@ phones and social media cap@@ abilities for a safety test .
at the Dul@@ ce for rej@@ ected as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers he wants to move some wor@@ se than to date - about such that pen@@ alties or their papers is to wear to wear their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legal radi@@ ated .
it also affects un@@ even im@@ per@@ ors and its questions is open .
and with some points - for instance , the question of pati@@ ence for example - is the question : what does this actually do with safety and ter@@ ror ?
Yes , says de Ma@@ ici@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the them@@ es and ter@@ ror .
but it &apos;s not able to speak in abs@@ ence that the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ter of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
Moreover , many people took part in the high refuge@@ e camps for care about security .
and things that emplo@@ y people were able to emplo@@ y out times in the election cycle times .
the inner safety is imm@@ ers@@ ed in focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
and yes , it stand down .
consequ@@ ently , Union and SPD are thus incre@@ as@@ ingly incre@@ as@@ ingly on the subject of internal security .
in the past days it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ st@@ y stre@@ et@@ ite about the equipment of the police , then about an unc@@ ertain@@ ty ideas collection , which also require a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return of double citi@@ zens@@ hip .
de Ma@@ ici@@ ère is ti@@ red here to re@@ conc@@ iled tones .
from a return of the double pass , he is nothing .
we have deb@@ ate the discussion in Germany .
they are re@@ produced without mean@@ ing@@ ful it is not mean@@ ing@@ ful .
and during a burning of Bur@@ ka @-@ ban , he was constitu@@ tional .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tional , and whether it is indeed &quot; mostly &quot; mostly &quot; is intended for the co@@ co @-@ partner , it must still show .
it im@@ pris@@ oned in some time which might provide for dis@@ pu@@ te .
however , the SPD has been tried to profil@@ ing security in the topic of internal safety .
Part@@ y@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alling only last time to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contri@@ butes to the security . &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ se comes through .
despite diesel engine , the deliveries will be delivered worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
during the return period there is vert@@ eb@@ ble around a concept .
Volkswagen launches its deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car bu@@ ilder can start in the previous year despite the diesel engines thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets further to show a plus .
but in July the core stamp VW , especially in Western Europe and loaded the overall sales , such as in the D@@ ax not@@ ated companies .
worldwide , the VW brand was sold in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars and 1.8 percent less vehicles as in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market in Germany , the deliveries around almost a sail@@ ors .
Mark@@ eri@@ sch@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the we@@ aker numbers from July above all on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it was also given in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; in a few core markets .
in addition to the situation around the att@@ empt at Turkey , the British Vot@@ um will be charged to the Australia , explained a spok@@ es@@ person .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust can be calibr@@ ated first , it is also a min@@ us to Beech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the affected brand of Lower Saxony is further gli@@ de by the diesel sk@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months only an excl@@ usion of 0.9 percent to € 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales as Fred Kap@@ pler was able to take care of sales growth from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had man@@ ip@@ ulated with a software publisher man@@ ip@@ ulated .
in Germany alone , VW has some 2.5 million wag@@ ons for conversion into the workshops .
in the access of converting VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles there is fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power .
the car @-@ bu@@ ilder of the customers according to the conversion of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but not by a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was named after Friday in corporate cir@@ cles .
reason of ju@@ rist@@ ic enemies .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had been reported , Volkswagen grant its German customers now , yet a guarantee for equipped gasoline models .
this was confirmed on Monday VW representatives in the Federal Office of the Federal Office .
this meeting was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; VW has accompl@@ ish the editions of my research commission and the KBA customer base . &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations are not accepted , declared the Federal Office Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power after the conversion has no det@@ eri@@ or@@ ations and all typically approved vehicle values must remain unchanged .
Volkswagen Him@@ self uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was named in Business circuits .
with a wide concept &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen has the possibility to come to a half year after the conversion of the conversion approximately with a motor damage to a workshop - and that might be able to do so if the damage has nothing to do nothing .
even in the customer inter@@ esse , it is important to do that there was any damage to do nothing with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , to an insurance regarding possible warranty as it was named .
therefore you do not use the term &quot; guarantee for the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Raiffeis@@ enbank G@@ mund am Teg@@ ern@@ see is required of enough as@@ parag@@ us in future , as a second Institute in Germany .
ban@@ isters Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers that are waiting 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily con@@ vic@@ tories . &quot;
the German association German Banking speaks of a single fall and does not see the signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us gr@@ ape : not fear for their savings of pun@@ ishment . &quot;
balance banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they have to pay 0.4 per cent .
this fee is required by Raiffeis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100.000 euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily basis .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs of the future 400 euros in the year , &quot; Paul .
he jum@@ ps since a time of 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day on the other , and he could not be changed .
&quot; that lie with me on the central account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; said the banking .
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for each US $ 4000 . &quot;
after ver@@ ification principle , he will continue its cost .
the cash register in the saf@@ ari of the Raiffeis@@ enbank would be much too dangerous . &quot; I have already experienced it &apos;s four passes , I may not want the fifth ! &quot; , said the banking .
most of our customers have understanding and di@@ min@@ ing them to others .
just a few wal@@ ked to other banks .
the co@@ operative association in Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes significant costs . &quot;
they alone bear alone , &quot; is operational perman@@ ently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with the pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ er- and Raiffeis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made their sk@@ at@@ bank branches in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , President of Ban@@ ken@@ verb@@ andes , said : &quot; we are not expect that private customers will pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too much . &quot;
a ban@@ ker told , at the Teg@@ ern@@ see it is a cli@@ ent@@ el that is a little bit of a little bit . &quot;
&quot; that can be a small bank for a problem , if it was a money back for money .
founded in 1911 , Gen@@ ossen@@ schaft Bank G@@ mund has offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ Eg@@ ern , Kre@@ uth and Teg@@ ern@@ see .
in the area , actors , sports and entre@@ pren@@ eurs .
currently no further banks , the Gen@@ ossen@@ schaft association Bayern &quot; are currently known to charge an ex@@ position rate for deposits by private customers , &quot; said speaker Ernst .
the President of the German national banks and Raiffeisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öhlich in late June explains : &quot; the threshold , into the neg@@ atives , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition be hard , and it dro@@ wn@@ ed the migration of leg@@ acy to the competition .

Dest@@ ination Plates : who purchased life records ?
Read all Translate into English lon@@ ely men middle ages .
before you go to the comment part in order to transl@@ ate him under the ps@@ eu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ Al@@ le@@ foli@@ age war with rough pieces , this statement is leading of current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ pro@@ position of sound boards are not looking forward to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that we want to rest@@ ore the unity of physical objects , but to the Mid@@ life nost@@ alg@@ ia .
those who recently bought a plate , all pre @-@ super@@ vision are between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able bu@@ yer group .
it is also no hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has a em@@ oti@@ onal meaning : older platform bu@@ yers keep their fe@@ el@@ ings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , would you follow me in the midst of a gift street in Soho , and wild stu@@ ff@@ ed , before I stand ab@@ ide , my hands will stand and something g@@ ond@@ ering say , &quot; so , let &apos;s throw us a se@@ ams . &quot;
so , let us take a look at a glance .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent seller were able - is there as a hand@@ ful fantastic record special .
I would probably ask the camera to complete the camera for the next part in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops , and try to estimate their age and paintings .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I read from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector if I ask ?
&quot; I gu@@ ess them , &quot; says he .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
this sound@@ plates , above , ( he sent me the sn@@ ap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed him to the house , and let the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has a considerable amount of albums and sing@@ les , the result of its available income : it is now able to buy used as it was released and again to buy items when he was sold , when he was young and P@@ le@@ ite .
&quot; many things I purchase , are from the late 60@@ ern , early 70s , who appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably to buy something to buy them , &quot; says he . &quot;
he tun@@ ed that those who want to purchase the plates , rather , and added to this alone : &quot; I smoke not and I &apos;m not much too much .
this is my del@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , beli@@ eves that many customers that he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also notic@@ ed a new wave of people that are affected by the Medi@@ enh@@ ance , people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack to purchase their old vinyl .
by the discussions , I have led people in the rule around 1998 or 1999 their collection .
customers that once once sold their records to buy CDs , now their CDs to buy their records , &quot; says he .
that would expl@@ ain the boom to the record of a certain universe .
but what about the connected em@@ oti@@ onal signific@@ ance of panels ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recogni@@ ze that tables have a so@@ othing community of equ@@ ival@@ ents .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients will contact the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some plate fans feel being over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by the digital world and want to move the stability of conf@@ id@@ ential sound boards , from objects , happy young people .
&quot; I think , sometimes it may have a spaces or pos@@ session of the pos@@ session as a type of Tro@@ st , says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to emplo@@ y spiritual .
&quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; fl@@ aps are a staff of a record stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April unveil@@ ed that almost 50 % of people who have bought a plate which have not heard it .
the survey was also found that 41 % of a record players never have never use , while 7 % of those who have a record , no record players .
at this point of the news report I would probably look very pleased , while I had a st@@ acks of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works with So@@ unds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men mean age ) , has notic@@ ed a &quot; trop@@ hies &quot; of the re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came out , and said , &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ot@@ ead sound record , so I would like to put them into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a large percentage , but it happens .
more produc@@ t@@ loads , less mus@@ cles .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record players . &quot;
that are younger people , not older , which can only be back slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the Schall@@ platten is almost one whole floor , has a lower audience when I have cle@@ ans@@ ing .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , making photos , teen@@ ager and women mean age .
even if the atmosphere somewhat less relax@@ ed than in the previous stores , - Wild Be@@ asts latest version of experimental and sex@@ ually packed pop instead of experimental Jazz dr@@ yers from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ ity at the customer .
No one of them looks special , but nails of psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be bad@@ ly determined , if you want to meet someone at least 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , running since some minutes in the business and viewed the Vari@@ ables for sale .
it &apos;s rather a mann@@ equ@@ in like a big one .
it is not much so much , therefore the coll@@ ecting is no real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it operates with a love Se@@ uf@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to expl@@ ain it is really unique .
my last stop is a store that is said that a new generation of plate lo@@ vers will be inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters :
while I give the ticket , the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants to Must@@ ern , watching a group of young teen@@ agers who go for one moment to buy Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter , a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall of plates by Ad@@ ele , J@@ eff Bu@@ ck@@ ley , Am@@ y Win@@ e@@ house and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential records for an average collection .
No one sees it to - perhaps because they are only pure decoration , some so far above that it is impossible to leave it .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ key &quot; . &quot;
but in mind that each attrac@@ tion for these objects more money for the industry mean and some customers to the dep@@ ths of So@@ hos for more then , there is nothing to deci@@ de to deci@@ de .
it &apos;s not surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the beyond that is most for luxury objects like plates .
even if my im@@ for@@ ations made , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , leave it , at least in the table business in Soho , the great number of female collectors and plate lo@@ vers that exist in reality , record shops and online now , not taken into account .
this people work probably hard in school or offices .
you do not spend your Thursday morning with security through the b@@ umm@@ ing of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they knew of an un@@ sec@@ retary , 30 @-@ year old false Moder@@ ator , who had nothing f@@ ought against the sh@@ ould@@ ers .

here comes the En@@ for@@ TO trailer
Germany &apos;s raz@@ or should be set to the next generation of velocity : in different states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hing machines are tested especially effective .
the f@@ ut@@ u@@ rist@@ ic effective En@@ for@@ ge of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction site or refurb@@ ishing bridges , there is no necessary infra@@ structures to ensure there with a stationary Bl@@ itzer for maint@@ aining the speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or less .
the En@@ for@@ nic@@ er Trailer is Aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days , the case will be encry@@ pted over a modem for un@@ interru@@ pted measuring operation .
with laser technology , all vehicles can also be changed over several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as transpar@@ encies to time , trips and vehicle category are also aw@@ ak@@ ening .
in high @-@ quality condition , you can move the trailer according to manufacturer by each car with trailer hook .
with that it is not simple , it is lo@@ wered into the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the pav@@ ed and the way is van@@ ish .

great Britain h@@ aul@@ ed silver in the 7 @-@ bit Rugby , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defe@@ ated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stages in Rio .
Fi@@ ji ban@@ ked a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ Ste@@ pping , cons , lin@@ i@@ ency and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ da@@ ille every color .
the defe@@ at was flo@@ ur@@ ished by the non @-@ to@@ wing field of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts at this tournament , in the New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defe@@ at of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final day could fall in the final day .
but it &apos;s independent fi@@ ji in this form a 15 @-@ man team in the form .
it could be a Tro@@ st one - but it is probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow a gold medal is a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ coach Ben Ryan , the former chief of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago they lost to Ryan every game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they only lost one .
this folder will we@@ ed to do but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks G@@ BS from Sp@@ ass .
it felt for the cap@@ tain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , when you would run in traffic b@@ usses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as the ocean colon@@ is@@ au in the corner .
still another attack from the right corner , J@@ erry Tu@@ w@@ ai was still a further attack on the right corner of the right hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly notic@@ ed the ball .
a convinc@@ ing t@@ ack@@ le from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stand 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ vers@@ ing i@@ ff and there was still over a minute running time ... in the first half .
V@@ Guatem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ val@@ ed by more weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ ks up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion was a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it &apos;s so that Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 to play while GB was still ad@@ her@@ ed .
so it is also .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time good , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was carried out after a br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched a try for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran already long to fav@@ our of the south @-@ se@@ aner , whose fans s@@ laugh@@ s and t@@ anz@@ ler on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to adm@@ ire the play@@ ful side of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame sat the i @-@ Bag with another att@@ empt in the last seconds .
the Pfi@@ ff saw Fi@@ j@@ is , and the Fi@@ j@@ is be@@ aten and f@@ ought be@@ aten in the lawn .
previously Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated Fi@@ ji Japan in the sem@@ i@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ated and Great Britain in a kno@@ ck@@ out half match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ rest and sco@@ red a gate among the post in the second half .
a br@@ illi@@ antes late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anth@@ ony of the English 15 @-@ aside teams , secured the profit and the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the strug@@ gle with the cancer of the train@@ ers to a rowing machine .
there is no em@@ ot@@ inal@@ y gold than with these games and that want to be what hot .
from the first rowing machine up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ats who entered the history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional signific@@ ance at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two parts of sat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she was in suc@@ cession for the second Olympi@@ ah@@ ag@@ old in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid on such a scale .
her Domin@@ anz was absolutely , with all their 39.@@ ter run , which is also an example .
what we see two br@@ illi@@ ante Athlet@@ es , which does not refl@@ ect the surface with the eleg@@ ance of pregn@@ ancy , which does not refl@@ ects the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind every gold in the Rud@@ ern is a Bat@@ aillon to con@@ vic@@ tories , which was the difference to make the difference , and it was no har@@ vest@@ ed than the trainer , who would not survi@@ ve this day when he was diagn@@ osed every day when he was diagn@@ osed with him .
how he said , What ris@@ ky .
I had b@@ low@@ ing cancer , which is op@@ eri@@ de and did they did .
if you do not do it , spread it throughout .
it would have been a pretty good situation .
it changed a little view .
Williams was diagn@@ osed in December 2013 .
the trio had happ@@ iness that he could start in early 2014 , outside the season , what the interru@@ ption took place on a minimum , if this is under such circum@@ st@@ ances of the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go again to me again .
it was a law@@ ful .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it too much larger .
in the in@@ qui@@ et@@ ability of victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve in the morning to speak a little more than otherwise , he tried to try his own change .
St@@ anning , which was as cap@@ tain in the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in one use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a em@@ oti@@ onal w@@ re@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only , how much I have had to work and hel@@ ping them to Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , there is no one that is a massive thanks to him . he is the best Trainer of the world .
I would have any better person to exercise or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhyth@@ m with which their opp@@ onent able to keep her opp@@ onent .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started in New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver was too much in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to leave it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something like .
we wanted to have no fire@@ works , we wanted to get a good result , down and win the race that we did too .
the pair will take a time for a year before dec@@ isions will meet on his future .
Glo@@ ver must be the next week at a wedding , their own with the TV ad@@ vent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now , it wants to enjoy the moment .
I don &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to attack that I am a Olympic winner .
it was all that new for me and I was so st@@ ressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that fe@@ els like much better , &quot; she said .
ex@@ empl@@ ary for 31 years in suc@@ cession for clarinet
the Managing Director of the Research Group &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer Group , &quot; Ru@@ pp@@ ert G@@ öller , will go into reti@@ rement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian wide . &quot;
a small fr@@ ac@@ eous pot@@ able water association as a model for large water producing .
this was named in some time in the original fun@@ ny at a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower fran@@ ken is .
the work of the v@@ ail group was Bavarian &quot; Bavarian far as an ex@@ empl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all the R@@ up@@ ert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twelve association , including 28 years as director .
he was adopted at the age of 65 in the age of 65 .
drinking water association with head@@ quarter in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promot@@ es about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplied 32 locations and Weil@@ er with about 5500 inhabitants .
member states are the municip@@ alities Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supplies for other cities and municip@@ alities .
the present ch@@ airman , broad@@ casting may@@ on@@ ster@@ in Gertrud Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that R@@ up@@ ert was stopped in 1985 as a water level and was appointed CEO of the twelve .
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and maint@@ aining the maintenance and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ers , the budget of fees and contributions to emergency service and contributions to emergency service , said the ch@@ air@@ woman .
as outstanding events they recognized the commissi@@ oning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1998 ) , real estate in the field of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of a Central Computer controller ( 1999 ) , the reconstruction of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the re@@ pro@@ positions of water lines .
there was no stand@@ still given and I got again released again , because of water life be@@ ware and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ dati@@ o , she kept Gö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with much heart blood for his water @-@ purpose , and he has worked for the water @-@ purpose association as it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago er than real pract@@ iti@@ zens of the fail@@ ures of the fail@@ ure group on Nit@@ rat@@ es@@ cent in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken may be present .
for this , he received much recognition and praise .
R@@ up@@ ert G@@ öller &apos;s hand side lo@@ ans Alf@@ ons Gar@@ ons , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water fir@@ m@@ art and he was a faithful button .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his view , he called the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the new re@@ structuring of the twelve .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were at the cemetery at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on January 3 .
here we had to process the whole night at minus 17 degrees , that the villages were supplied with water .
once again the supply of Neu@@ brunn you can only be maintained once , because they filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with eggs .
the management of pot@@ able water @-@ purpose was transferred to Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer from lau@@ ded to Daniel St@@ ür@@ ert G@@ öller &apos;s suc@@ cession .

steel - light view for German steel industry
the risk of bur@@ nt and energy @-@ ten@@ sive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millimeters .
financial loads that the sector from the eco @-@ cost funding from the table are thre@@ at@@ ened from the table .
it may lead to the liberation from the Renew@@ able Energy Build@@ ings in accordance with the inventory production in the German steel industry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Freit@@ as edition ) .
&quot; I really happy about that we could reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
initially planned for the European Commission , the steel manufacturer , the gases from the t@@ ang@@ ol@@ ov@@ ens to set the electricity generation for power consumption to ask for their own consumption .
the steel industry thre@@ at@@ ened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said , WA@@ Z , we grant a basic certificate with the EU Commission to tal@@ ks with compet@@ itions in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators were replaced in steel works , f@@ ills an EEG conversion of 20 percent .
but these will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall were welcomed the uni@@ fication of Germany with the EU Commission to the own power generation .
this means the status of the previous regulations are written .
the particular importance have the successful effort by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; in terms of our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; further must follow &quot; . &quot;
&quot; also with the Reform of the emission regulations are climate and employment targets , &quot; IG Metall b@@ oss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry has been involved in over@@ capacity and a substanti@@ al price pressure .
last year , the situation continues to be considered the world &apos;s largest generation of China in order to streng@@ then the con@@ spir@@ acy demand in steel to the world market .
European manufacturers to@@ ss Chinese steel concentr@@ ating price d@@ ump@@ ing .
during the spring of this spring , the situation has somewhat relax@@ ed .
the economic prosp@@ ects have shown on imp@@ air@@ ment effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of economic prosp@@ ects in China .
how su@@ stain@@ ably the price is un@@ clear .
the German Bran@@ ch pri@@ m Thy@@ ss@@ en@@ Krupp stayed on Thursday to Thursday .
at last all the prices are more stag@@ n@@ ered .
the industry is re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost@@ umes .
Thy@@ ss@@ en@@ Krupp wanted to complete the lock@@ able works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ 000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel manufacturer remain secured despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced at 3.4 million tonnes due to six percent less crude steel as in the same year , as the economic uni@@ fication of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the total amount therefore went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year .
the association ends in the next months thanks to a improved order situation .
fel@@ low@@ ship , spirit , health : sing pra@@ yers good
Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p already accompanied her whole life : as young girls , she took her in the school choir , in the teacher , and she s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing myself - em@@ oti@@ onal and physical , &quot; describes it .
after a sample fe@@ els them , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of living , says it .
she &apos;s very next door with her health and her spirit something good .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several persp@@ ectives a great hob@@ by for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Sen@@ iors League .
most of the people sing together in a choir and share the joy of music , describes h@@ ac@@ kler .
due to regular mer@@ ger , sen@@ iors social contacts may be linked and maintain .
for frequently , social and familiar structures in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
these experience also has Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in her choir : &quot; hers@@ elf to organ@@ ise themselves to learn to the other , and apart from one another - a choir is a very special form of the compos@@ itions . &quot;
sing pra@@ ises in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler can be seen in the positive sense .
because the sen@@ iors is a depth and controlled breath@@ ing .
those who regularly is regularly , the d@@ ens is not as fast as fast as the d@@ est .
even if it comes to the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hob@@ by .
on el@@ derly people , S@@ ingen is often a special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal state of the sen@@ ior citi@@ zen .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to the everyday life , both in school as well as in the leisure time .
L@@ enz is commonly observed that the s@@ ingen or list@@ ening of songs with older people many memories , often connected to positive po@@ is@@ ers of their youth season .
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially mel@@ o@@ dies himself also den@@ om@@ ed people in long life events .
at the end of the head , the head will also be asked for a particular performance .
at the same time to concentrate on your own voice and a pre@@ defined rhyth@@ m - this is a great co@@ gn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , but not only foc@@ used on itself .
another positive aspect is recognition that travels across the choir in ch@@ orus , my@@ ac@@ kler .
a enthusi@@ astic audience is a great lo@@ b .
the self @-@ valuable components grows through the choir in the choir .
yourself to show itself : if I have long enough for something , I will get better and weak over me - these experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start with singing s@@ ingen , so there &apos;s enough .
who want to try out a new hob@@ by , should not hes@@ itate to have little tal@@ ent , ob@@ serv@@ eth L@@ enz .
they sing pra@@ ises not alone - at 50 sing@@ les people who list@@ ens to it once a tone ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing a man from the announcement in a sen@@ ior choir , you can simply connect to .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
who would like to sing in a religious choir , can turn right to the church or church .
many sen@@ iors cho@@ irs will also be found on the Internet .
who does not have access to the internet , the family can ask friends or neigh@@ bo@@ urs with the Internet computer .
who@@ ever has to sing to sing , should be able to be able to use h@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has somewhat Liber@@ ation - that applies to every age .
cats Re@@ act as K@@ ater to ter@@ ror from the young
Bi@@ olog@@ ists have been investig@@ ated in Hannover , which effect mel@@ ts for adult animals .
for their surprise , the Mi@@ ch was not cold - however , they kept them in the difference to the female .
Female cats may recogn@@ ise the determination of wr@@ inkl@@ es of c@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys to the cl@@ ause of the cl@@ ause .
they re@@ act ten percent faster on l@@ itt@@ ens that were found in great dist@@ ress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
C@@ ater re@@ act also on the ru@@ bs of kit@@ ten - however always equ@@ ally .
&quot; appar@@ ent are the acoustic differences between the Mi@@ st@@ range of less and strong exc@@ erp@@ ts for the males are not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
she is first author of the study that was published in this Friday at the journal &quot; BM@@ C E@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in an previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the coo@@ kie @-@ ter@@ ror with the help of their help needs .
a total of nine adult bu@@ yers were treated and eight k@@ itt@@ ens from the Tier@@ H .
they were played a Ru@@ le of Kl@@ einer , which were taken for three minutes from the to@@ ss@@ box and separated from mother and cut star .
to other , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with writing by stronger K@@ itt@@ ens , which were up in addition to the other .
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample for key@@ chain .
&quot; every female , even those who had not had their own night , have differenti@@ ated differenti@@ ated to the ter@@ ror . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speakers if you played the very aw@@ ake k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be born or developed with sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male was re@@ acts , he said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have been investig@@ ated several times the reactions of women and men on a baby noise .
also , some studies showed that women sens@@ iti@@ ver were re@@ acted , quite equal whether they were already mot@@ h@@ ers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sch@@ e@@ um@@ ann .

&quot; the bom@@ bs &quot; the same manuscript , &quot; said Ar@@ mi@@ egen@@ eral Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early journalists .
&quot; we are going out of that there is a co@@ ordin@@ ated ass@@ ack@@ e . &quot;
it is too early to adap@@ t to possible motifs - probably the de@@ eds of Muslim Reb@@ els .
even Thai media wanted to know the samples of a sample that is typical for the bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate Muslim popul@@ atist@@ s in the south of the country .
the Thai Police had declared that the attacks of attack is not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with the international ter@@ ror@@ ism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age that is limited to limited areas and provinc@@ es , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
one go much more of them that the bom@@ bs of the con@@ vol@@ unt@@ ary military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities were interested in the past days in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the locations .
still be un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
the Police den@@ ied their civil buildings around the country , security in around major government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and pleasure quarter .

increase in the highest level of safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday successful days after a contro@@ versi@@ al refer@@ endum about one of the military jun@@ ta .
this sp@@ ati@@ al to the military large effect even in the next few years .
Jun@@ ta Chef and Minister @-@ President Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CHA said , bom@@ bs were an att@@ empt to take ch@@ aos , while the country into the direction of stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta that took power in 2014 after a phase in blo@@ ody accident , even the kingdom continues to stability and order .
however , it is also not law@@ ful to get to the army in the utter@@ most south of the land of the wor@@ st u@@ prising in the handle in the outer first south of the country .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok at a stop of a popular Hind@@ u Sch@@ un@@ clean 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody stop of the youngest history of the country .
the right &quot; identity of identity movement &quot; is registered in the visor for the constitu@@ tional protection .
after several provinc@@ es , the constitu@@ tional action was put under observation in the covenant .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos;s Attack points for the Freedom of Social Democratic Party , &quot; said the Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus the Islamic Faith , or from the Middle East into extreme wise is diff@@ used .
therefore we ob@@ serve the movement .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group line with French ro@@ ots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
they are applied against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ide @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass flow &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony , Saxony and Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ia - ob@@ serve the &quot; identity document &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been clos@@ ely coordin@@ ated by the decision in clos@@ ely with the Provinc@@ es .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; try to get their target group since it is , &quot; said the constitu@@ tional compl@@ aint . &quot;
Gen &apos;@@ ral try to try them with jug@@ end@@ ous language , often with p@@ opp@@ ers music .
the ten Islam@@ ists as well as legal effect .
this is no concrete advertising for the own matter .
the prop@@ ag@@ anda is to speak the people of em@@ oti@@ onal .
young people are due in particular ways in particular manner .
this is dangerous .
last , it had given out several federal states reports from the &quot; Id@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D polit@@ icians .
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge .
for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts this type only relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Aph@@ D - through certain persons , the extreme production is changes and extreme st@@ ically .
thus , whether they have such an effect influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a look at the significant increase of legal notes and att@@ acked down to as@@ yl@@ um and refugees in this context , he would not speak not yet from new right Ter@@ ror@@ ism in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in the past few years that it can enter the legal structures .
there were the old &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ aler Group .
it can be clear that further legal notes , or small groups formed against as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers , attacks against as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers or attacks from other rights such mot@@ ives .
however , a German @-@ wide control of ter@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able but not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups be created on the regional level or in social network .
in addition , Ma@@ ate contributed to the account of people that many sur@@ passes to the account of people who had not entered the right scene in the right scene .
this is the organ exciting .
many of the facts in attacks are not known to as@@ yl@@ um for as@@ yl@@ um , political mot@@ iv@@ ated or trailer of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ence , who had chosen in the right of the cour@@ age , who were possibly polit@@ ically chosen or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who have chosen by the right of the extreme ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;

in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old comes with a back@@ stand of 48 seconds , and reached the 59@@ th place of 59 Star@@ ters .
but it was rather just a sport@@ y figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old did not participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special law firm in the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in the presented countries .
as in Ethi@@ opia the most athl@@ ete , wanted to do something else to do something else .

his time , he sm@@ ote only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Freestyle he played no role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; too .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric Mo@@ uss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .

as the may@@ or Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) was reported on the approval of the house by the Land@@ rat@@ a Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these san@@ itation plants run .
due to the legal bas@@ ics , the market is oblig@@ ed to im@@ plement the plants .

in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , even over - or under@@ cover@@ ies from the previous cal@@ cul@@ atory period are excl@@ ude .
the gra@@ dient increases by Schmidt that it was able to produce relatively small facilities in all three waste plants with a very low water san@@ itation , which varies from 6800 to 12000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution situation for example , expenses for necessary rep@@ airs of several thousand euros .
in addition , the sew@@ er@@ age can be slightly down@@ ward in all three plants .
continue in the und@@ ern@@ e@@ vid@@ ent calendar period during all three plants , not last due to their age @-@ refurb@@ ishment and rep@@ airs expenses in a substanti@@ al scope .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ der pole , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt dis@@ missed that in the sew@@ age plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation unit had to be ex@@ changed due to the loss of damage .

Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res , the continued support and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new calendar period in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses clearly notic@@ eable that at the low sew@@ age in the three plants the expend@@ itu@@ res for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in this , Schmidt added the market shared with the overall maintenance costs in sew@@ er@@ age plants in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will remain on a duration of stone houses to continue to continue to continue to increase the supply area of the sew@@ age area of the sew@@ age area , because it is in defic@@ i@@ ary public facilities .

with its filter tool it allows a sn@@ ake of about 150 million dollars to change reality and play with identity in such a way to play the ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn to a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .

&quot; during the first half of 2015 there were many central Comm@@ and Press Releases , opinions and statements before the Congress clearly considered it the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com is publi@@ cl@@ y known that a military review of Mos@@ ph@@ s already started in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest town of Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from Kan@@ sas , in a position .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of the Central Comm@@ and will be found at IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can read the task force in life after them is w@@ ond@@ ered that anal@@ ysts were wor@@ ries regarding the man@@ ip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday report will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
additional investig@@ ations of the Cent@@ Com reports by the general insp@@ ectors of the Ministry of Defense in G@@ ange .
the members of the news Tu@@ esdays published on Thursday its own findings with some of the concl@@ usions of the repub@@ li@@ can T@@ ask Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com delivered a sur@@ rendered process for the creation of subsequent assessment on I@@ sil and the Ira@@ q@@ i Security Service , &quot; announced the highly @-@ Day dem@@ oc@@ rat in Adam B. The ship , in a position .
this process , as the ship , &quot; del@@ ayed the release of subsequent reports , &quot; fo@@ ol@@ ed the mor@@ al under anal@@ ysts , and &quot; gave a little space for different views . &quot;
but Mr. ship and Democrats condem@@ ned to have no crit@@ ics on a con@@ vention of the White House with the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st as regards a certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results for the con@@ vention of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
in the past August , the New York Times submitted by investigation by the Pentagon , which were included according to compl@@ aints by Cent@@ Com c@@ yst@@ ories .
Lt@@ . C@@ md@@ r Patrick Evans , a press spok@@ es@@ man of the Pentagon , gave out a statement on behalf of the Congress of the Congress , while the investigation of the General inspection are still in the G@@ ange .
but he also gave that &quot; experts from di@@ gi@@ veness regarding the interpretation of more complex data , and the news services and the defence Ministry of this important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investig@@ ations have ad@@ verse events over the question of a successful air@@ campaign under American Gu@@ ided tour in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion , which made in the mean@@ time from a growing number of rel@@ atives to the defence ) .
however , the debt of the last year , the question was dis@@ card@@ ed by President Obama to Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other cl@@ is@@ en@@ ings .
the crit@@ ic@@ ism regarding the Islamic State of the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a scri@@ bes sitting in Iraq , looked at a little time to Iraq and a little time to make about the consequences of the inv@@ asion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current report on the Islamic state .
last year , the team will present the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government &apos;s government , no significant effects on the financial situation in the ter@@ ror@@ Group , since this pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s former Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was established by members of legisl@@ ative due to its mat@@ ely positive in@@ estim@@ ation of war situation in a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four match in the field ho@@ ckey of women to be a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after they had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie reported the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americ@@ ans have won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a mem@@ or@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they cannot remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not w@@ ishing to people who keep your goals in memory .
however , it is : the Americ@@ ans are at 4 @-@ 0 at the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition and are equ@@ ally registered in their group with the brit@@ ish first place , which will remain in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will be held on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter , the game will deci@@ de that the two within their group will take place six teams in the first and second place .
the first plat@@ eau is slightly longer run longer from the way to carry the other group .
as ever the game is going on Saturday , the Americ@@ ans have trig@@ ger@@ ed by their success story by their success story , four years after having last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this teams .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years old ho@@ ckey bat in hands ( their two older si@@ sters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years , she became the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 which could not quali@@ fy for the head@@ ers .
then the year 2012 , in which she went for her and her team .
in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thus began to use things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not work the workers in London , which we have now .
we have completely covered the ru@@ it completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the Tor@@ re@@ ins in the first half of the game with a return from the se@@ am area .
India had gone in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself sur@@ pris@@ ingly and held the game status from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game in their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the fl@@ ake ball about the left fl@@ ank , then put the ball into the gate to the Americ@@ ans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Melissa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ u@@ tout was the first one of the whole tournament for the ke@@ eper in the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well becomes the result of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tr@@ amp
where ever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is well @-@ resistant and unusual , an rapid relay between the competition and stre@@ ches .
it is , when the ol@@ ymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ le would be a burning rod , which will protect from poverty by the arm to the fun@@ ner .
you can not switch to TV the TV , read a newspaper or talking to the conversation of your neigh@@ bo@@ urs , without more than Simone B@@ iles , K@@ atie Led@@ eck@@ y or the route between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le Clos .
and then there are still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who would be sent for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s 20 m with dimples , would have been sent by spons@@ ors and well @-@ feel @-@ TV advertisement when it would be a sw@@ immer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ allen .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tr@@ amp of gold .
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame illumin@@ ates not each event .
further from the center , partly in the shade , sports sports , which are not generally accepted : air@@ field shooting , bad@@ min@@ ton , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breast sw@@ im and would like to rule it long .
but when I make reas@@ onable reas@@ onable for my certain love , then let me leave the attention to the dis@@ crete Charme of the tr@@ amp .
although the tr@@ amp ski@@ p has been a Olympic event , as it was in Sydney since 2000 , it was the last 16 years so much that I knew that I knew that there is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional Ig@@ or@@ ance .
although the USA , athletes sent to competition , it has never won a medal at the tr@@ amp of the tr@@ amp and made a athletes who made it up to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ si@@ ans are to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and the Canadian for women .
Dong Dong in China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will def@@ end their gold medal from London .
the tr@@ amp ski@@ p has a certain external lateral cup , partially because it fits the un@@ cl@@ ari@@ fied ear pass@@ ages for a C@@ low@@ ns@@ school as the for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but only a little enthusi@@ ast am .
it has hum@@ oro@@ us@@ ly potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous quot@@ ation of its never sh@@ ru@@ ined , but also the Gra@@ z@@ ie of the Turn@@ ens and diving , which combines two sports , which un@@ ited it in essenti@@ ally .
the word &quot; Trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline what so much means &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
exciting winner will jump on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of fall@@ ing movements ( turning , H@@ righteous and Sal@@ tos ) .
they are evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ad program in accordance with execution , difficulty and &quot; flying time . &quot;
two athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are comp@@ ete in Rio mut@@ ually .
the most common ol@@ ymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go towards gold , faster , go up and above , sometimes up to the target , sometimes up and back , up@@ wards , and down below the playground .
they are not only the cap@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output , but in the tv @-@ transmission also another cave : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ oos .
the tar@@ get@@ ed diff@@ ern@@ ity is Nobel , adm@@ ir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cally , and it &apos;s enough to take up an audience to te@@ ars .
but it &apos;s also that which I would like to try for this games as a bit fatigue .
it offers a resp@@ ir@@ atory break .
the v@@ ector of the tr@@ amp @-@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or them pr@@ ono@@ unc@@ ed down , appar@@ ent to eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly like a astr@@ onom@@ er , then go down to the top , then eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly again after the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without trouble , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ecti@@ c attack on the target , no w@@ ol@@ ves in the cores , only the dreams of time and gra@@ vity .
it is so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only .
the qualification and ends of women are held on Friday morning , in stre@@ aming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC is dis@@ pat@@ ched the ends as part of a afternoon blo@@ c of two days from 14.00 .
in the am@@ id@@ st of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , which will probably transl@@ ate in general tum@@ ult probably .
if the con@@ sci@@ ousness is achieved only through the attacks and the objects of male athletes , as it recently pre@@ ad the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner in accordance with the The Wall Street Journal again - then , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expect its focus on air , new fan .
&quot; a generation prot@@ est &quot; in Ethi@@ opia , Long One Association of the USA
certain Prot@@ ests in Ethi@@ opia
demonstr@@ ators who require a political changes in Ethi@@ opia , pour in certain resistance of the government .
witnesses say that Z@@ ig Prot@@ estant has killed during the inter@@ vention with the police ac@@ ute .
is Ethi@@ opia just to break ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid board of Western people with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months , prot@@ ests against the government and continued even more areas .
last week stor@@ ms thousands of people on the streets and the required fundam@@ ental policy changes .
according to Human Rights organisations , the answer was un@@ m@@ erci@@ ful .
witnesses test@@ ified that the polic@@ emen of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators were killed and killed .
in circulation videos about the prot@@ ests , probably from the last or early this year , show how security rod young people were prop@@ ose to make this purpose , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now an in@@ coming examination .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country , and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethi@@ opia is the most pop@@ ulous country of Africa and the stability of the west .
American military and intelligen@@ ce service works clos@@ ely together with Ethi@@ opia in order to com@@ bat ter@@ ror@@ ism , in particular in Som@@ alia . only few countries in Africa , even so much Western help .
Ethi@@ op@@ ian economy expanded the p@@ ace of p@@ ace .
its infrastructure has improved dram@@ ati@@ cally - there is a new p@@ end@@ urance train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ eba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethi@@ opia was anything like a pre@@ face for democ@@ racy - Human Rights organizations have continued the suppression of the government - the op@@ position in the country has been resol@@ ved to fig@@ hts against silence .
many were sent into ex@@ ile or in prison , or were killed in the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you have access and this no other options have to prot@@ est , breaks out of &quot; , said Se@@ y@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a l@@ ecturer in Central Ethi@@ opia .
the entire Youth prot@@ est .
a generation prot@@ est .
there are numerous compl@@ aints that cover all from the floor up to the lit@@ ters in regards to power the co@@ alition .
after a wide crit@@ ici@@ zed election last year , the regional party and its al@@ lies were now 100 percent of the par@@ liament .
at the same time the st@@ resses along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ acked , contro@@ versi@@ al line called in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ tics that separ@@ atist@@ as described as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were in the last years more or less be@@ ings , the tur@@ bul@@ ences were sho@@ ot@@ ed and again and again .
several factors expl@@ ain why fe@@ el@@ ings after the years ago , H@@ ink@@ an@@ ns under the surface is explo@@ de .
the first appears har@@ m@@ less : Smartphones .
only in the past few years , many Ethi@@ opia was able to communic@@ ate using the social media , as cheap smart@@ phones are always more frequent and often improved .
even if the government had access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at prot@@ ests , many people still communic@@ ate over Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which communic@@ ate them to keep it .
several young Ethi@@ opia gave them to prot@@ ests so too prot@@ ests .
the second factor is that there is more soli@@ dar@@ ity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two major eth@@ ics in Ethi@@ opia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since etching , Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethi@@ opia mainly Christian universities , in polit@@ ics and economy , while they live the Oro@@ mos of whom they are Mus@@ li@@ ms and in flat land@@ alities .
but this also changes itself .
&quot; we are able to ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a guide of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest prot@@ ests found in areas of Am@@ h@@ ara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethi@@ opia is dom@@ inated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and military services in the military intelligen@@ ce , and polit@@ ics are domin@@ ant .
the third reason for the inv@@ est is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ orn leader , was up to his death in a non cri@@ cket ill@@ ness in the year 2012 , 17 years in Ethi@@ opia Prime Minister .
he was a t@@ ac@@ tical Gen@@ ie , a man who could think around the corners .
anal@@ ysts say that it was particularly sealed in it , early signs of un@@ satis@@ faction and special commission to do your opp@@ onent and to do them .
&quot; the current regime is missing at this fundam@@ ental si@@ ck , said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis .
Ethi@@ opia of new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively small reasons to take place the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
differ@@ ently as Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region Nord@@ ä@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ ens , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south .
analys@@ er say that he does not have confidence of the confidence of the Tig@@ ray security services .
many believed that the result may be po@@ uring more blood .
the last time that Ethi@@ opia was established in 2005 after thousands of elections against elections , according to the data of analys@@ es appar@@ ent from the government , and afterwards st@@ olen .
during the following Raz@@ zi@@ es , many prot@@ estant were killed , even if it was less than in the last months , and this time he went out relatively fast .
development expert lo@@ op@@ ian guides for their visi@@ on@@ ary infrastructure planning , as well as the new p@@ end@@ ul@@ ler@@ ite , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty line .
but ob@@ viously un@@ ob@@ vious that prev@@ ents the internal ab@@ normal@@ ities of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month att@@ acked on@@ au@@ diti@@ oned in g@@ on@@ ads , a am@@ har@@ sh city , of Tig@@ ray , shops , and hat@@ ched to the Tig@@ ray in the social media .
analys@@ er say that the prot@@ ests the United States and other Western Al@@ lies in an independent position .
the American government used Ethi@@ opia as the basis for dr@@ on flights over the ad@@ jac@@ ent Som@@ alia , even if they had recently closed this basis .
while the West unique democ@@ racy wants to support democ@@ racy , he wants to pass that his prohib@@ ition in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Lord Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin difference . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama , &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot; was founded
Donald J. Tr@@ ump att@@ empt@@ ed to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y to scatter his campaign by taking his multiple rep@@ etition , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , the &quot; founder of the ter@@ ror@@ group of Islamic State , not serious .
this purpose was a new questions regarding the communication of the Republi@@ can presid@@ ential data of the Republi@@ can , whether it is clear and to communic@@ ate with the American public .
it also brings his co @-@ stre@@ am@@ ites that would have to take him during an er@@ eig@@ ous phase in protection , to expl@@ ain statements , which he could not be registered .
after having made the interpre@@ ting at a vot@@ ive evening at Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had taken place on Thursday and stock in inter@@ views on Thursday and consi@@ sted in inter@@ views , the President and Mrs. Clinton had been created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is simple sar@@ cop@@ ic .
the Twe@@ et was un@@ like to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of inter@@ views said , he thought the so@@ w .
as the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to remember the testim@@ ony that Mr. Obama calls him , wanted to know the Republi@@ can presid@@ ential candidate .
the last storm of crit@@ ic@@ ism at Mr. Tr@@ ump went down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried out the focus of his campaign due to a random conversion based on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump att@@ empt@@ ed to return to this topic .
on Twitter m@@ eld@@ ently he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons will result in higher taxes and found that he found his speech in long time .
Mr. Tr@@ ump brought Sar@@ kas@@ mus already to his defense .
at the end of July he moved strong crit@@ ic@@ ism in the end of July , as he thought , Mrs. Clin@@ ton enamel is b@@ aked , however , he explained the sar@@ cop@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump allow to shift the l@@ ingu@@ ish b@@ orders in polit@@ ics and then to rest back as required .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test such as certain messages from his fans how they are coming , and then , if the response falls , according to the response . &quot; said Ruth Sh@@ erman , a communication expert who ob@@ serve the language of the candidates . &quot;
but I think , it &apos;s cle@@ ver enough to hold his statements , so that they can be interpre@@ ted in different way and fashion .
instead of the sound for the presid@@ ential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received another sound exp@@ ands , because his frag@@ ments are returned .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was released on Friday , showed a guide with a large lecture in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump att@@ emp@@ ts to understand himself to understand his prov@@ oc@@ ations for his prov@@ oc@@ ations , he ins@@ ult@@ ed his crit@@ ics to understand his testim@@ onies or to understand his hum@@ or .
but during the last months of his Presid@@ ency campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Sch@@ er@@ ze brought his loy@@ al mit@@ ig@@ ites into the un@@ comfortable situation to him , regard@@ less of it , such as prov@@ oc@@ ant his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps pro@@ min@@ ent@@ est prin@@ ce , gave great effort to def@@ end the candidates today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview from Thursday to def@@ end .
&quot; I believe what he says , leg@@ it@@ ime , political Comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus he as@@ ks to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton in the Islamic state was founded .
it is true in this sense that Obama was a fast @-@ known , small organization , he called her back @-@ kn@@ kler , completely wrong and des@@ ol@@ ly it , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most Ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am Republi@@ can att@@ empt@@ ed to gu@@ ard@@ ed that the government had served as an external mini@@ ster@@ in , which IS@@ IS had allowed to spread out of IS@@ IS to control the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his att@@ aches on the media , and thre@@ w them to destroy them at each of his words , and might be dist@@ ur@@ rec@@ y against him .
he short@@ ened the &quot; ar@@ men , Jewish &quot; TV experts who are trying to understand him , &quot; You can &apos;t understand it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats condem@@ ned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps dis@@ pen@@ se than just a further evidence that he had been un@@ ited for the presid@@ ential election .
once again , café in Green@@ point gets back on the market .
ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ res@@ een café in Williamsburg , in which one could pay only a Wi @-@ Fi , but it was a good pleasure for 15 years .
of course , of course , the prices taken from its Bedford Avenue charging front .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie collection , sold in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in shape of Cup@@ cakes .
indi@@ gen@@ ous women than last loss in a dev@@ ast@@ ating city .
the artist has written on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change but I can still believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York Change is , then it is also new .
a re @-@ revi@@ ated Ver@@ b Cafe opened its last November in Green@@ point , less than one mile north of its original site .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and acc@@ epts credit cards , but still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year staff of the old Caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new Caf@@ és .
in 2001 he began working at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when he offered a customer , money for a new outdoor area , he was defe@@ ated to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , was held .
ver@@ b used the same distribut@@ ors for Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ om@@ elet model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he was going to experim@@ ent with experim@@ ent .
he led the new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ments such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ auti@@ fully onions .
there are natural re@@ iss@@ ors .
the café is served no beer more , there are fresh sa@@ wing .
after nine months of Rodri@@ guez , after nine months , he had notic@@ ed an important electricity to the old tribe .
&quot; many old customers were also incub@@ ated by prices from Williamsburg , he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira is a such customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg , visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
once the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while on the coffee , she said .
&quot; I was clear that it was at the coffee and culture in the ver@@ b , which fell in me . &quot;
now , they play back again , even if they were on this day instead of its usual I@@ ced coffee , a bl@@ ended Ch@@ ai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long term and faithful client since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work , and turned the same as the same .
&quot; I arrived after seven , every day as a Swiss watch and they prepare my Ever@@ ything @-@ Bag@@ el with butter .
photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experim@@ ent and put the new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changed its Ever@@ ything @-@ Bag@@ el with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no p@@ ill about it , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie collection , a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold coffee of caf@@ es as an access .
&quot; I think we will go on her offer , &quot; told Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also acc@@ epts this café .
a new customer has to translated into a new customer to transl@@ ate and Rodri@@ guez , he said , to make them soon , so that his new neigh@@ bo@@ urs .
the location has also further anticip@@ ation .
fill a local s@@ affron @-@ loc@@ ally to fill the cold coffee into bottles and for sale .
there is a chance that expanded the café on a not@@ able building .
for many customers a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café was closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt is the place of local and the best coffee at a new coffee , as a hom@@ ec@@ oming now .

Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in case of a Gre@@ enland , the 392 years old .
&quot; W@@ ahn@@ sin@@ n , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock this lifetime , which means of vert@@ eb@@ rates a world record .
in fact , the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist are already long as Gre@@ enland &apos;s Gre@@ enland .
only missing the evidence .
Gre@@ enland ha@@ en@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to ob@@ serve them in the ice @-@ sea front of the thin coastal co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because it is water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , diving in the surface usually only in winter .

the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long while the largest 502 centi@@ meters .
in order to determine the age of animals , they analy@@ ze them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of the shar@@ ks .
this center of the eye lens is already being built before the birth of the shar@@ ks which are not restored in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lens .
her birth should therefore be moved to the early 1960s , as a atom@@ ic purpose of larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
in the middle of 220 centi@@ meters length of the smallest be@@ asts of the L@@ ins@@ enk@@ ern , a low inf@@ usion of carbon @-@ 14 is trying to meet the nuclear we@@ apon , it is expected to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Gre@@ enland had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cos@@ mic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 493 centi@@ metres of Gre@@ enland was an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k was even 392 years old .
that Gre@@ at@@ hai @-@ females only then get off@@ spring when they are longer than four meters .
we were able to move the length of an old age .
since one of the animals with 392 centi@@ meters will be determined at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and his age with 156 years , Gre@@ enland with the off@@ spring ob@@ vious at least one half cent@@ uries .
this is also the same for vert@@ eb@@ rates currently world record .
that such meth@@ od@@ al@@ eme primarily live in icy waters , is not a random .
also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Gre@@ enland , whose bacon started a 120 years old Har@@ poon tip , was captured before Alaska .
through the low temperatures , the organ@@ ism also runs there from live animals to as@@ parag@@ us .
so you have later - and s@@ ould@@ ers s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm water in cold water , the animals are often especially large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through the animal warm@@ th .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a very small animal is end@@ ang@@ ered and should focus on it , preferably many off@@ spring , &quot; explains the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist Sc@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms at home , when Brit@@ on Gold for cycling hit
Sc@@ ott@@ ish Call@@ i Call@@ ing Sk@@ inner ra@@ sts last night in a def@@ aul@@ ted team in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for Ru@@ hm , when the British team has def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took a man who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud to take home a win from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
for four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cked victory at Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olympi@@ ast@@ ol Medal .
they repeated the tri@@ ck after having only one mod@@ est sixth place in London in March at the railway World Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ tim@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did this in time for not@@ ified .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man who remained in which they saw that they saw the potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that now fold it out .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - the finale of four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ eg@@ s - and Sk@@ inner proj@@ ected in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the standard round the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ ell with gold .
after his turn left , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a big part of transformation from where possible in a higher speed to allow it to slow@@ down it and to allow password to keep the tem@@ po .
Ho@@ y looked out of his position as BBC specialist in and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on that p@@ est on Pod@@ est .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a narrow sequence of comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best to do me a name .
we stopped at the ends at the end of a Olympi@@ ad and the world champion .
it was just un@@ believ@@ able .
there is no better type to win .
after the tri@@ umph of the tri@@ umph of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys he gave to that he fell after a weak start to the railway .
he moved this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of Engl@@ ish@@ man Ri@@ val .
for such a over@@ lap victory there was no such problem .
she said , &quot; It fe@@ els with all the GB fl@@ ags of the Tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot;
we have joined the last three months as a team .
we are so bad on many wor@@ tt@@ it@@ eln so bad that it was un@@ believ@@ able to win again at the Olympi@@ ad again .
this is an event that won a gold medal for the Nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the bar@@ rier of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ els , it is repe@@ at@@ edly repeated at three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would also be born for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23rd , was also born on 23 March ( as well as Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the k@@ id of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will start more than three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it fe@@ els something to win alone .
he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medal , he should defe@@ ated at night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ance for the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Brad@@ ly W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the vice @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 at the target .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of competition , while the W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins will be focus on security .
he held yesterday with regard to quali@@ fications before quali@@ fications to measure him to measure the functional size to measure his body size .
in the case of women , the tomorrow continued and finished , av@@ anc@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ i@@ bald of Mil@@ ng@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team leaves its strong team team to dom@@ inate the mid @-@ period of the Olympic Games and get a swe@@ ar to medals .
following a real unusual representation of absolute Domin@@ anz in Beijing and London , expectations have been downloaded for Rio .
it played dr@@ amas in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ ism and Mo@@ bb@@ ing@@ vor@@ ce as well as reti@@ rement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you see the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks completely after that , the legendary rep@@ utation G@@ BS , which has reached its high point to be repeated again .
future of f@@ ump sum of Portland due to sur@@ ge of energy agreement
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as full jobs of emplo@@ yers will be announced on the game , as the system oper@@ ators are pro@@ claimed to raise energy companies such as the supplied energy company .
this step followed by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further sub@@ si@@ dies on operation of the plant .
a maximinum payout of $ 20 runs for a 20 years .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the complex of Alco@@ a in Portland are on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations direct as well as direct in@@ directly could be dangerous .
in addition , it could occur to Domin@@ ican effects , since the melting capacity of approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Alco@@ a took the Point Henry melting , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ la plant .
the melting of Alco@@ a in Portland loses money and risk a closing time .
this step follows the years of co@@ ek@@ ul@@ ations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which is the large aluminium sh@@ mel@@ on with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , that it is going to announce that three further owners will be announced their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out of which the plant in Portland is being operated , which means an additional physical demand for electricity by the melting ) , &quot; is divided by the company .
AG@@ L told that the tre@@ ati@@ es were so @-@ called &quot; secure stores &quot; that will have been in force from November 2016 .
the tre@@ ati@@ es have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L are from that contracts will contri@@ bute to the income in fiscal 17 , &quot; the current supplier . &quot;
all potential imp@@ acts on AG@@ L over the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ations for large trade @-@ phase prices .
AG@@ L dep@@ artments with that the value of the tre@@ ati@@ es had already written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Alco@@ a said that the decision to book the tre@@ ati@@ es to operate the contracts of Alco@@ as ... the melting of Alco@@ as , or the power to melt the melting . &quot;
the US @-@ company said that it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang completed in 2010 , who had to become a statement that it is not guilty , why it came to the contract .
analys@@ es due to the bad economic circum@@ st@@ ances of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
in reference on the statements of the Analy@@ tics at the beginning of the week , the Head of Oper@@ ations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Portland operates approximately 600 meg@@ awatt and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts .
in both plants , both plants should van@@ ish from the market , which mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator would not be good , he said .

K@@ end@@ all , the market event in E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a space full of people that I love , brought me the view of this co@@ vers to W@@ einen , wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bi@@ zar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the card@@ ed Re@@ ality video , which shows the entire card@@ as@@ hi@@ an family and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , how they &apos;re g@@ otten the Cover of their sister and ends with a classical W@@ ending : they have all of a sur@@ ve@@ art@@ y .
this represents the cl@@ am@@ eless b@@ orders for almost every birthday party , &quot; You thought that we had for@@ g@@ otten Di@@ ch ? &quot; , with the hon@@ est@@ ability of a character can@@ oe on a Senate at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but K@@ ris had to participate in this pub@@ licity .
with regard to the sept@@ et issue of Vog@@ ue has begun with security a new era of card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim lik@@ ened to see what the Vog@@ ue Cover was defe@@ ated ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sept@@ et issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague .
the sept@@ et issue is for Vog@@ ue the most popular edition of the year .
with a circumference that was similar to a picture band than a mo@@ de@@ magazine , attrac@@ ts the edition of a large number of advertising writ@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a ) of the 832 pages of the wo@@ ods 615 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its tribute stars is expected to see so that in the last two years the pictures of the magazine will still be carried out before the official notice .
women who were already on the cover , com@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evang@@ eli@@ sta and K@@ ate Moss .
in the last years , more &quot; Prof@@ ess@@ or@@ ters were clear , the mod@@ eling &quot; as &quot; models , the eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Winner and di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ at@@ ter@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ through model &quot; of its generation - under the early category , it is in good society .
these min@@ es are not related to famous people or Re@@ ality Stars or y@@ outh@@ s from today that know how to get a good sn@@ ake video ( even if everything is applicable ) .
they are really tal@@ ented women that draw up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover appeared with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
naturally really like J@@ enn@@ ers success not everyone .
J@@ enn@@ ese position was always st@@ ressed with her Re@@ ality @-@ TV story in the fashion world .
in June , the ein@@ y Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her Col@@ leg@@ in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ amp@@ cks of Aug@@ enb@@ li@@ cks . &quot;
these fe@@ el@@ ings bo@@ asts again , when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut the point seems to go on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the Cover of Vog@@ ue on the Cover of Vog@@ ue .
it is in true sense of the word of the word .
she works for Marc Jacobs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .

they sold from her made pictures of Cind@@ y CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her time she is known in Re@@ ality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .

Nokia 9000 Comm@@ unic@@ ator : the first Smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in periods : 20 years ago the Nokia Comm@@ unic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor is dom@@ inate the world - its manufacturers experienced a Des@@ aster .
the device wo@@ g almost a half kilograms and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was not good in the hand .
in the contr@@ ary , it was quite k@@ lo@@ big .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning of eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , that would be enough for about two be@@ ats with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipping with at least 16 gig@@ abyte
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Comm@@ unic@@ ator &quot; came to exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops , and it was the first smart@@ phone .
for a few euros , enthusi@@ asts can buy the devices even on the Internet , but they are coming from the Stone Age of the Internet .
but 20 years ago , the Comm@@ unic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturers had a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West Germany format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent for the former standards a lot of : SMS and e @-@ ma@@ ils were sent and received , also by fax it was to reach Comm@@ unic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML brow@@ s@@ ers even if you cut off .
a watch calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar as a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black white screen .
rather proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus approximately 1400 euros .
the average price Ret@@ ail Price of smart@@ phones in Germany stood at 392 euros .
No one could replace the Comm@@ unic@@ ator at the beginning of the smart@@ phone era in August 1996 .
since then everything is different .
the phone phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Handy @-@ Sp@@ arte of the Fin@@ nen experienced a special Des@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft sold in Microsoft .
the market is delivered today , which was all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere , that is today for very many people every day .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smart@@ phone users worldwide .
Sold for about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple released just 555 million pieces .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this is the well @-@ running business of the count@@ less App @-@ provi@@ ders and telec@@ omm@@ unications equipment .
around the smart@@ phone , there is now an entire industry .
at the beginning of 2007 , the dec@@ is@@ ive break@@ through to the mass market came in early 2007 , at the time of the Apple , Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction of the i@@ Phones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use with Touch screen .
Apple started on Apple started , the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who r@@ uled the market in the market .
she dis@@ appeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the mass@@ ages have now Apple and Asian provi@@ ders like Samsung .
the smart@@ phone is 20 years after its in@@ vention .
in average , each German has now sold 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we have to learn to learn all the smart@@ phone once again , just Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens board for staff .
permanent availability is now considered as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
in England the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit has to extend the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only appe@@ aring in our local municip@@ alities and in whole London , but not in all country .
for me , the largest attrac@@ tion He@@ ath@@ rows , the same as at that time in 2012 was able to ensure a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions will benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will reach new ways by He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s new possibilities near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local municip@@ alities , we have already create 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were in London in 2012 , it will be such as they think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I was told that England was never for the games that we will be ready for the games at the World stage .
the two fl@@ att@@ ed in 2012 are right and they are wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always o@@ bst@@ acles to over@@ come , but He@@ ath@@ row is answered every thing .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is a lot of and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is a possibility to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at the wit@@ ness@@ ed growth and jobs in order to leave the airport as well as in whole GB .
we have created a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was made a £ 11 billions of eu@@ res infra@@ structures program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport transfers , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two ob@@ es@@ ome running way of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running time , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the London Games of 2012 was a great success for GB and I am conf@@ ident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it &apos;s time that we expand this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as well as the future trade and create jobs that can be proud of the England .

on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would be blo@@ cked on its desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a b@@ log@@ in that could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that its desktop page will change the encod@@ ing regarding its advertising page , to det@@ ect it displays that part of the side advertising is to be det@@ ect .
but ad@@ stack announced that it has found a new way to go to the new codes .
in a b@@ last post , the Speaker of Ad@@ ult Ben Williams that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er strug@@ gle between the police cur@@ ves open source community and the h@@ ap@@ ors already since the in@@ vention of law@@ yers in the G@@ ange , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media in the strug@@ gle is a strong Indi@@ z , such as the organ exc@@ erp@@ ts for the industry have become abnormal .
worldwide , according to a study of the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , roughly 200 million people were har@@ cur@@ ing ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , which allows you to access to Facebook via their mobile devices , makes han@@ dic@@ tive 84 percent of advertising space Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has seen it on An@@ zeig@@ ename on Desktop PCs , since mobile An@@ zeig@@ er has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks Mobile App for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , one speaker with .
advertisement on your desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of entry , such as Facebook will be worth such as lo@@ cker .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that it was his &quot; An@@ zeig@@ en@@ pre@@ fer@@ enc@@ es@@ tool &quot; would be up@@ loaded to the people more control over them .
on Thursday the Facebook claimed Facebook compl@@ aints to block new filter , because they would also block content on the side , who are no advertising .
&quot; for users , this is no positive experience , therefore we &apos;re planning to connect the problem with a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication with an e @-@ mail message .
An@@ zeig@@ ename are a st@@ ump sum , so that we have concentr@@ ated on the development tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to place more control into the hands of the people .
woman in probably su@@ icide on the Swiss motorway
the sacri@@ fice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses , after one woman in the early morning courses on Thursday at an assumed su@@ icide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the inc@@ ident happened on A1 near the canton of Vau@@ d in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after mid@@ night .
a woman raised in Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in a acts of des@@ p@@ ation &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , said the police in the Vau@@ d .
it is ob@@ viously that there was a Swiss trad@@ emark in the age of 49 , which was transferred from several vehicles , including a lor@@ ries to kill themselves .
she died before place .
several drivers have been taken , but some aren &apos;t have been identified , said the police , which as well as witnesses of the prec@@ eding to report .
it was opened a investig@@ ational procedure that is a logical &quot; step in such a situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter is the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains below that one of the driver will be displayed .
was a comp@@ ilation of avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the Prosec@@ utor must deci@@ de , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases have shown in the last five years that the driver will not be de@@ duc@@ ted to respon@@ si@@ bilities .
in each of the two cases - one person in Dun@@ kl@@ es on the fre@@ eway - was decided that the drivers must not come from the night on the motorway , as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a police was acqu@@ itted when they had been crossing a man and killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk also dr@@ unk on the road con@@ sci@@ ousness , and passed the court .
the court issued that the polic@@ emen -- which had responded to a emergency call -- based on a just@@ ified way , that the presence of a man on the street , was completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ tive situation , &quot; said the jud@@ ges .
each of which further information regarding the inc@@ ident at the Thursday close to Morges , the police should be issued under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
NA@@ SA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once again
the Venus was according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate change probably once again .
scientists at God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past in Venus based on tools and alg@@ orith@@ ms to them of climate for@@ ts .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot water , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere once have been used .
scientists have previously demonstrated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its den@@ se atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus have a thin and a similar atmosphere could be slowly and nevertheless slowly rotating .
the model illumin@@ ated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet has pres@@ um@@ ably more dry def@@ end than the earth , but had once enough water and geograph@@ ical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and faster re@@ stra@@ int .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus are almost two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientists Anth@@ ony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , what is a bre@@ lla , to ab@@ bre@@ ach the surface of a large part of solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today are today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which had res@@ embl@@ es the evolution from the plan@@ etary neb@@ ula .
although it was probably extinc@@ t , the Venus was susp@@ ended to a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
her Oc@@ e@@ ans dis@@ fig@@ ured and her water v@@ ap@@ or was bur@@ nt from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere continued to carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Climate protection in the ge@@ ophy@@ si@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming to a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy passed on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a minor legal situation in the decision of the teams .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and att@@ enti@@ ve that the association will be looking for immediately after a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I &apos;ve met my duties as a head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and traditi@@ ons , &quot; sold out of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position .
I have thought about it in the summer of summer and much more that I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it a higher level to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations are perfectly suited to the organization .
he must also have a compl@@ eting law on dec@@ isions that aff@@ ect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , Roy had been added to Roy on May 23 , 2013 , because of his contributions for the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we estimate all what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy was recognized during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Ad@@ ams Awards as the best Trainer of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defe@@ ated in the first round of the Play@@ offs from Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
when Hall of F@@ ame ke@@ eper has won four Stan@@ ley Cu@@ ps -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ e@@ lar@@ us will take up discussions on , set strike in
the employees regarding the dis@@ per@@ ation of northern lar@@ ations will be susp@@ ended while all the dis@@ p@@ utes are set for a new conversation round on the table , said negoti@@ ator .
stri@@ kes against the oil field service provi@@ ders were carried out for spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons will confirm that we have made us to start the un@@ win@@ ds of the current stre@@ ites , &quot; it is in a joint statement .
we will hold some all @-@ day meetings in the next weeks to start the beginning next year to start the problems .
the uni@@ ons said that her last stri@@ kes that was the first in over 25 years , a prot@@ est against possible w@@ age of up to 30 percent .
in the North Sea , Wood Group has short@@ ened around 9 percent due to negative market pressure in the North Sea .
the organisation of the company follows a 10 percent decline for On@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company is required to occur in order by the market growth .
Shell has announced for its part of people and plans to release his oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ ation bus with the British energy company BG Group .
based on energy companies , based on the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had to leave the European Union by the decision of Br@@ its in June .
the Sc@@ ott@@ ish Parliament voted Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with emplo@@ yers to discuss one of the biggest work@@ outs that took place since a generation in the North Sea since .
the North Sea is important for regional economic , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and the whole country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few works , he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion spending will be expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate from stars in the Star of P@@ le@@ j@@ aden
the most recent mission with Ke@@ pler Wel@@ dre@@ tel@@ es@@ kop has helped astr@@ onom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the Star of P@@ le@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help the astr@@ onom@@ ers to understand why stars in con@@ stellation can be rot@@ ated , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods with the planet stand .
&quot; we hope that we learn more about the relation between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ le@@ j@@ aden is located 445 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which origin@@ ated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach an adult age .
they turn right now on the fastest .
to peak rotation rates this very small quantities of star@@ ved con@@ stellation .
since this winch has travel through the magnetic fields of your stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star al@@ tert , its rotation rate begins to slow@@ down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by taking the time between the appe@@ aring of a recognis@@ able stell@@ ations -- such as sun@@ fl@@ ecken -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that massive stars s@@ lower than less massive stars .
re@@ bel compar@@ es the stars with tables , wher@@ eby larger stars s@@ lower slopes are lower than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; of the P@@ le@@ th@@ ades we see that s@@ ends rot@@ ors to be a massive , wh@@ it@@ her to be faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ le@@ j@@ aden so close to the ideal cos@@ m@@ ical laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qu@@ alities .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ le@@ j@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much more about us to learn more , like the same as , W@@ ann and Why stars their Rot@@ ation rates , and so@@ w their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about its latest analysis of rotation rates of the P@@ le@@ j@@ ades which will be released in A@@ str@@ onom@@ ical Journal .

Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are att@@ acked by the first official d@@ op@@ ing acc@@ id@@ ents .
a aw@@ ak@@ ful athl@@ ete won almost a medal .
before the seventh race , the first official d@@ op@@ ing people have known the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese sw@@ imm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres ste@@ ep@@ it@@ orial notes in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish W@@ eig@@ ht@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excl@@ uded - immediately before the beginning of the w@@ age of Athletics Men will come this messages for the time .
in Ch@@ en , Ch@@ en was rej@@ ected the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de since the past Sunday , as mas@@ king resources used for d@@ op@@ ing matter .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CAS confirmed on Friday morning local time to its excl@@ usion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took place the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just about 0.09 seconds , they missed the bronze anti@@ d@@ ille .
on Friday , Ch@@ en had to attend the lectures over 50 m of Freestyle .
during the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing in progress .
the national association the matter of &quot; very serious and demands of ch@@ ari@@ al cooperation with investig@@ ations &quot; , quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will accept the judgment with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CAS . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC but the CAS for the sanc@@ tu@@ ation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the message over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa due to the 33 @-@ year @-@ old also went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV transmitter B@@ NT .
she is not guilty , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ sman was not the correct f@@ itt@@ ees , &quot; said , &quot; We will stand in Bulgarian , so many are already excl@@ uded . &quot;
so , all weig@@ ht@@ lif@@ ter from ch@@ ronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded Nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; was also known as the London Olympi@@ ast@@ eger in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days ago was positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole of ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both best@@ ow@@ ls the in@@ feed , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further serious blow for Rep@@ utation of the whole sports .
the world association employs over an exception for system@@ atic Dop@@ ing in Rio , also produced le@@ av@@ ed news in Rio numerous poor messages .
in the swimming sport , the earlier appoint@@ ments also had taken place in China for more difficult explo@@ sions between the athletes .
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympi@@ ast@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .

data stop : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ acker its ran@@ s@@ om
programm@@ ers from the press malware , currently tar@@ get@@ ed businesses at - and are successfully successful .
according to a current survey of the malware infection specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of these companies have been at least once , partially several victims of an attack with Er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ press .
40 percent of the victims were paid by the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of the val@@ leys required to use the challeng@@ ed systems and data .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their er@@ pressing software according to ob@@ serv@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes based on attacks in the company sites .
they will succe@@ ed there , the potential ran@@ ty was significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; we ob@@ serve a simple fast evolution of cont@@ amin@@ ating software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes b@@ oss Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ ynski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 the most m@@ oul@@ ds were still designed to send advertising .
then discovered the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors software for itself .
only , private users were the goal but the change was re@@ ck@@ ened rapidly during the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a O@@ pf@@ ers , she looks f@@ um@@ bled files like about W@@ ord@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives photos and videos .
these files encry@@ pted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the original sustainable .
subsequently , the software will be the recei@@ v@@ ables of the press compress@@ ors .
in order to receive the extension code to the files , the sacri@@ fic@@ i@@ ble money is usually survi@@ ved in the form of the cry@@ p@@ to@@ currency bit@@ coin - usually in the form of the cry@@ p@@ to@@ currency bit@@ coin .
but where in private use the personal picture database is on the game , it is available for sensitive customer data or project databases , without production .
accordingly , the damage falls off if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is e@@ aten .
22 per cent of the affected German companies caused by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent , even had to break the business activities , in a case of people were in@@ sured .
in Germany , several hosp@@ itals were victims of attack patients whose patients were thre@@ at@@ ened by the loss of n@@ ak@@ ened nations .
&quot; we say to the victims : p@@ ays not , you have been promot@@ ed to this problem , explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ ynski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who numbers have to get their data again .
for man@@ agers it is difficult to sett@@ le the requirement of per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
the h@@ acker also know that and try everything to build a good Rep@@ utation .
in a recent study , the security for@@ cement of F @-@ Secure has examined the user surface and the contact with the ex@@ press@@ ors and come to the result : the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors are trying to take a type of customer service to take more money .
you expl@@ ain their sacri@@ fic@@ es by chat , as they can pay via bit@@ coin , you can freely allow freely accessible support sites or dec@@ ry@@ pt example .
and they will rede@@ emed private cap@@ tains according to payments of a few hundred euro , the company you have to negoti@@ ate hard and five @-@ digit sum to get their data enc@@ ode .
in view of the potential high and relatively risk @-@ up prof@@ its are the h@@ acker always professional and share the work , explains security ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Internet provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; one single person can write an R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that there are three or four people .
the program@@ mer sell their compensation software then in the form of a software design to the actual Er@@ press@@ ors .
the new cloud kits produced by winning the malware , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; Delivery includes a adjustment tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , function and fire can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the press release is then looking for another h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly bought software among the victims .
we live in an services industry .
for example , in one of the fore@@ ground , buying the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on the many PCs as many PCs .
payment takes place per induc@@ ed computer .
&quot; normally , the Cri@@ min@@ es then carry sp@@ ammer with the spread of sp@@ reading , declared Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known in many companies that their data is better .
over 50 percent of companies IT responsibility in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ survey trust the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware of file @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ ers@@ software .
accordingly , the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors are already tested .
&quot; if the encryption of data is no adequ@@ ate thre@@ at for successful income more than customer lists or quot@@ ations , such as customer lists or price calcul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ CEO Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ ynski .
this is the compensation potential depending on the type of data is even more than before .
too , the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors could be completely new goals in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstr@@ ates the Security Council , how they were able to receive a thermostat with the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the fre@@ eze of a der@@ art blo@@ cked heating could be worth a money .
if the val@@ leys then , instead of the heating in the future a whole production line in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be used in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and comfortable
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda has just packed : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ at@@ ility of an min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V which was constructed on the same new platform as the new j@@ azz was actually ob@@ vious in everyday .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the f@@ und &apos;s lot , it causes a lot of clos@@ ely .
the materials of the inside screw are well processed and tho@@ roughly comfortable , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is somewhat above .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage box .
it is not only a trunk compartment of 453 l in high quality and 10@@ 26 l in spr@@ inkl@@ ed back ready , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ical when it sounds : the sitting area can be made up as a cin@@ emat@@ ography and offer a storage box that is located by the ground up to 1.24 m high .
the trunk can be well ventil@@ ated , but the cargo height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .

better traffic flow on the highway fre@@ est@@ inger
it is regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November .
however , this is to change : the legal notice is to be extended .
this is good news for all car cli@@ sts that stand in professional traffic on the ambient road each evening when they are driving on the fre@@ est@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road operations extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the legal reserve of 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the hammer on the right onto the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares itself is an early @-@ time , reducing the complete handle on the many part of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the lost exit had the CD@@ U @-@ fr@@ action in the district of the Austrian Münster @-@ West Germany .
driving lane on the Zu@@ br@@ inger ner@@ v@@ t the car driver is primarily between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , from the back to the bridge over the Alb@@ ers@@ lo@@ ans track and sometimes also beyond .
the needle is the needle @-@ hr front of the B 51 , just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here traffic only one sp@@ uri@@ ous about the motorway bridge is free .
the second track had to be returned to the three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had that the bridge is no longer necessary to increase the required load capacity , in order to increase the heavy load traffic lights .
like long , this Eng@@ pass and the associated working day St@@ au will not say that the state of state did not say .
however it is to calculate with years : for the bridge has a official rest of up to 2034 .
for the extension of the legal ent@@ ert@@ esp@@ ur , the state @-@ party has visited the traffic @-@ we@@ aker time in the school holidays because with dis@@ abilities .
traffic will pass on Tuesday and on Wednesday single track at the building site .

relaxing night : Tips vs sleeping inter@@ ference
in the evening he over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming around the night , one night is w@@ ake , in the morning , in the morning , it is not far too familiar with sleep .
that is everything else than relaxing .
after all , you &apos;re using such problems in good Society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , some one quarter of adults sleep dis@@ orders and more than ten percent receiving their sleep often or perman@@ ently .
how do sleeping difficulties or sleep dis@@ orders ?
there are several forms of sleep dis@@ orders , and there may be their diverse causes , bet@@ ont Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aring , managing director of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schl@@ ert@@ or@@ etion and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
however , what a land@@ mark below is , but the ins@@ om@@ nie is never , so an in@@ - and break@@ down inter@@ ference .
just the break@@ down lots of people as per@@ petual or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ necht , Board member of the German Hous@@ eh@@ older association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind Sle@@ ep inter@@ ference ?
the causes of sleep dis@@ orders are complex .
behind , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors , but even medic@@ ations can be applied .
not rare , the sleep dis@@ orders of another ill@@ ness .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is primarily with a de@@ pression often , says Yahweh .
and it may be that different factors for each other .
if for example , a belt disc may be bad@@ ly lie , whose every two to three hours are spread between all two to three hours and starts to gr@@ ows , there is a example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when you should do with sleep dis@@ orders ?
those over a period of one month stay in at least three nights per week is not well maintained and the day should be imp@@ orted to doctor &apos;s doctor .
the conveni@@ ence can look like differ@@ ently : it is defe@@ ated , ti@@ red , un@@ separated , has difficulties with attention and the concentration , is easy to tear or physi@@ cally safe , such as stomach or he@@ ada@@ che .
in order to claim the sleeping inter@@ ference , it is important to find their causes .
as the treatment options , a co@@ gn@@ itive Ver@@ hal@@ ten@@ st@@ her@@ ie or medic@@ ations - classical dormit@@ ories only in exceptional cases are only for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ est .
there are hardly notic@@ ed sleeping in Germany in Germany , man@@ ship Prof. Ingo Fi@@ ery , head of the inter@@ discipl@@ inary medicine centre of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , you should first to use case in case of sleep problems , called We@@ alth .
it can be resol@@ ved with investig@@ ations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for examination in the sleep laboratory , medi@@ a@@ iner , for example , with breath@@ ing people , if you don &apos;t hes@@ itate to canc@@ ers or if you don &apos;t want the cause of a sleep dis@@ infection that fe@@ asi@@ ble fe@@ asi@@ ble .
we have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not make a lunch break , says Fi@@ ery .
after the c@@ abling you go to his normal time in bed .
in addition to the electrodes on the body it is a nose @-@ eye@@ wear , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger .
it also shows a camera on the ceiling to the ceiling .
how can we pay the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many positions on which one can put a better sleep for a better sleep .
We@@ aring is counts : regular sleeping and stand times , not to sleep in bed , not to sleep , not TV for in@@ sleep , alcohol and night watch out to check out , and this is quite conf@@ ident .
what the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German Schw@@ immer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has led by Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting out of the D@@ SV team at the Olympic Games .
in December 2014 he had been rec@@ ru@@ ited for the first time in D@@ oh@@ a for the first time in D@@ oh@@ a , and set his first world record .
the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler is put on Facebook after his hands toward the use of the Ex @-@ team .
&quot; in a country to get € 20,000 with a premium of € 20,000 , and one jung@@ le 150.000 € should be no more about missing medals w@@ ond@@ ers , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on his Facebook page .
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing controls were very good .
with that , we can do not comp@@ eting with countries that are much promote and op@@ posed on the subject of d@@ op@@ ing or even so much .
&quot; I say not that the controls shall be shut down here . &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eb@@ ack start nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency , Germany ( N@@ ada ) .

airport : arrested by Ban@@ de Bag@@ gage
professional slide near Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded by taking two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts used as Ban@@ de several pocket and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 pm civil servants in the field of the airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de again known which was known from the polic@@ emen of the past the@@ ft .
the two women and two men had committed su@@ stain@@ ing in mid @-@ July this year and were common , worked and especially profession@@ ally .
the speci@@ alists in the crime of Cri@@ mea 34 can be submitted to the evidence of criminal off@@ ences according to Germany , four acts .
they had a total of over 15,000 Euro in total .
Alt@@ sup@@ erst@@ ruc@@ tures , a few Lind@@ enb@@ ä@@ ck@@ chen , in between the first sight , the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works in the first sight of the city , but the police belongs to the &quot; hazardous places &quot; of the city .
one pass the street from east to west , comes to play@@ grounds , a refres@@ h@@ ated kind@@ ergarten and a be@@ aver .
the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house has a man &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; has been tested . &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will also be demol@@ ished soon , will be built : until 2017 , there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about these &quot; tr@@ en@@ forced district , &quot; how the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called for the last weeks yet preferred with burning cars .
this is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied by now , the residents are occupied , but at the ground floor , however , are occupied rooms and will be used for events .
since the beginning of the year , in the beginning of the year , the police sei@@ zes the police against the police against the project , as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonom@@ ous violence .
after on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ sch@@ mi@@ ede were cle@@ ared the police three weeks , according to the official statements , according to 30 @-@ 40 offici@@ als and three teams in front of the street and kept visitors of it to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , renewed construction worker is on the order of the un@@ known house owners .
on 13 July the Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was il@@ legal , and one day later , police and construction workers under the y@@ ub@@ el of Sym@@ path@@ is@@ ers and lived .
in this summer afternoon the road peac@@ efully : parents walk with children sp@@ azi@@ onale , people sit in the bour@@ ge@@ erst@@ eig in front of the houses in the sun , other places close to Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the Hau@@ spro@@ uts are a primary school and kind@@ erg@@ art@@ ens .
left violence is not the main care : K@@ erst@@ in Neug@@ eb@@ auer , which d@@ wells in K@@ ie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who are located here three children , are mainly from the police sequence .
with the inhabitants of the hood , they divi@@ de the sor@@ rows of increasing ten@@ ants and gent@@ lem@@ an .
it doesn &apos;t know not after a k@@ ie@@ z , who wish to wish several pol@@ ishing before v@@ and@@ ali@@ stic L@@ akes .
the h@@ ubs , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator and the police between the hous@@ et@@ ers and their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , do not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin@@ s was actually a traditional working quarter , which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk .
even women occup@@ ations and the resulting residential projects are long to the c@@ ie@@ z : 1990 were occupied numerous houses in the former DDR , including almost the entire main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
during the Main@@ zer under great police sei@@ zes in a regul@@ atory roads , many of the projects were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by people today , that they were occupied by 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become incre@@ as@@ ingly on the magn@@ ets for tourists and elections from all over the world : with them , now living from the GDR @-@ times and former HA@@ USB@@ ES@@ ET@@ ZER is their c@@ ie@@ z .
this makes also notic@@ ed at the rentals , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Rig@@ a@@ er will be att@@ acked as symbols for these development : they recogni@@ ze them on the wor@@ thy discs or fresh@@ ly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades which were thro@@ wn with color straps .
this year , no other street was often mentioned as often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
a reason that not all neigh@@ bo@@ urs therefore could see the problem that they are not affected by Kri@@ min@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences , according to body corru@@ ption that almost exclusively for polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the fir@@ st@@ ats make experts from the tend@@ ency rather the new buildings and fresh renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neug@@ eb@@ auer , which has been inhabited since 17 years in a rental house near the um@@ str@@ itt@@ ens 94 , the imm@@ unity cannot be given .
what did so , she is important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bo@@ urs , who were not intended to be intended .
even the famous burning cars will no longer be longer in Rig@@ a@@ er than in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architect , its street is no cold burning point , in the opposite : &quot; here is a one another man , lives together on the street and gets more of one another with what is different . &quot;
Neug@@ eb@@ auer is moved to Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
consequ@@ ently , it was also important that the d@@ welt in their road : from the police , polit@@ ics and the media which suddenly claim the interpretation of the area in July .
but in the eyes of farm@@ ers such as new@@ born , the road will continue to be taken away : through as@@ yl@@ ed new buildings in former construction sites , which the old inhabitants passed away .
&quot; that &apos;s all the own@@ ership of own@@ s which are not interesting - here are more people who are not as well as well as well , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Viol@@ ence and Dest@@ ruc@@ tion , I absolutely not he@@ ath@@ ei@@ ve . &quot;
but what should I do if any man hear@@ ken to someone ?
there is no har@@ vest@@ ed on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
for bre@@ eds that gl@@ aci@@ zed over a v@@ om@@ bs , thro@@ wn has a little understanding : the can@@ yon and the left scene belonged to the K@@ ie@@ z .
who@@ ever pul@@ ling , should be aware of his - just like someone who dra@@ ws in a tree @-@ quarter , there is bad about noise of noise .
all only with names of people are asked to do not called to be called with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ nika E@@ usch@@ le is a new refuge@@ e camp
An@@ nika E@@ usch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ ers .
it is also social work before place .
since July An@@ nika E@@ usch@@ le has been a refuge@@ e camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supported the team of management at Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a response in all actors : refugees , working group refuge@@ e assistance , administration , authorities and who are still missing .
Reg@@ ine customer indicates that the volunte@@ ers are more than d@@ ank@@ able that E@@ usch@@ le is now that E@@ usch@@ le is now , the ei@@ er@@ le@@ gende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which has been especially a problem .
so some - less sp@@ otted than much more on the number of emerg@@ ing areas - common , when the administration wanted to write the place .
we search@@ ed an administrative capacity with a tal@@ ent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , one ei@@ er@@ le@@ gende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but the administrative work is not a central area , mean An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
especially to organize organization , work with people in front of site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been working for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , says the Shel@@ ine customer says that An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le hon@@ ors and main actors now supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and ur@@ is@@ diction problems .
soon new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem is there since some time to find flats for the inter@@ vention who have been recognis@@ ed .
the municip@@ alities are responsible for the connection installation .
you need to accommodate refugees in their own or appropriate residence .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of this accommodation need to bear the municip@@ alities .
the respon@@ si@@ bilities changed to the local community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner will offer its apartment .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to takes place any private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work yet , it is to be assigned to private apartments so De@@ usch@@ le .
so they must be int@@ enti@@ ful apartments , as well as it is so nice .
so soon new containers will be placed in the wash@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments is it not done .
persp@@ ective is the key@@ word , there are regi@@ sters customer and An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le .
in addition to a permanent lead you are pract@@ iti@@ oner , training places , training places , a @-@ Euro Jobs and A@@ est@@ ration for refugees and mig@@ rants , which are cau@@ ght or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the Bau@@ hof or help Haus@@ mei@@ er , non @-@ profit work - and the mot@@ iv@@ ated and very ord@@ erly , like An@@ nika De@@ usch@@ le reports .
they ho@@ pes that the work will result in a positive action .
this is &quot; No employment her@@ ap@@ ia . &quot;
but do not work yet work .
the day needed a fixed structure , say De@@ usch@@ le and client .
hum@@ ans have to develop a satis@@ faction of experience .
so do it offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and above all language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so also ski@@ p here administration and hon@@ orary law .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling that they are w@@ ished in Germany in Germany .
the long time of the procedure is a problem .
you have to expl@@ ain the refugees that it will take , and it takes care of mean@@ time , for example with language course .
who exec@@ utes any feeling that he could not help to help you in Ur@@ bach , will not work and be un@@ cont@@ actor , who will never integ@@ rate himself .
the clear majority is mot@@ iv@@ ated .
problem is there , but there are customer , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of De@@ usch@@ le and client is always there , other to mot@@ iv@@ ate .
all this be a &quot; m@@ am@@ mot@@ h job . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two according to recent reservation of radi@@ c@@ alization , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; No , &quot; says the customer , &quot; says the customer , &quot; what man@@ cher n@@ ai@@ v n@@ ant mag . &quot; a resi@@ dual risks could you not close it .
S@@ ensi@@ bil@@ ateral be the hel@@ per but already .
this acc@@ id@@ ents are subject to refugees in the refugees .
they were the an@@ xi@@ ety that the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ter was complete in promise .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do nothing , says the Shel@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and hon@@ orary news on site and in the region moved to activities .
in the background , they are always in the background that soon a new jobs will come to refugees and mig@@ rants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer any policy .
actually , it is impossible to place them Hel@@ ping .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there where we want to pass , &quot; says An@@ nika E@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
No new refugees that the situation would relax .
Reg@@ ine customer makes also clearly that the Urb@@ acher also have to integ@@ rate the previous people to integ@@ rate this people .
that are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but if people are in need to help them , they are both women .
the political world situation is so compens@@ ated because there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : acc@@ us@@ her with hel@@ icopter

two unknown men are aw@@ alt@@ ed on Friday morning at 8.50 clock in a multi @-@ family house in Lind@@ en@@ weg .

the two men were about 1.65 up to 1.70 meters in size , probably both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ od@@ ed pul@@ lis .
you are at the direction of downtown .
for the ex@@ h@@ ness , the police continued several stri@@ kes , as well as a police hel@@ icopter .
the f@@ emin@@ ation ran out of success without success .
well , the in@@ known before the apartment was close to the apartment and in her escape .
