<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and trade agreements TTP - that want to convert both Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are however on the control and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences between the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warned, as the state of the economy can be harm - with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wolle the economy to death and treble to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, he would be different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to regulation, and he makes itself for an extensive tax reform, significantly - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, says: the state has certain tasks to meet, he has reopen the opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the tax would be raised for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the moulds, Trump, and Clinton is almost similar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are denied from the state of the Republican Teaparty-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Trump could be able to increase internal discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Distinct are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump intends to build coal plants and expand the coal for the USA in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">To date, oil promotion is also possible to terminate the Paris climate protection, he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Clinton, Clinton wants to extend the Renewable Energies and calls: "a country will create the superintes of clean energies and million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the TPP, the mean trading company, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA do not want to isolate international trading - but just just American jobs are better.</seg>
<seg id="25">That should be better to get better, calls approximately Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump should do this question, is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says, he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the next months is likely to develop more to the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one side, Trump, the economy and the citizen consumed to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep it before that the household deficit would be even larger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side, Clinton at least made from the rich in fact that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of external pages "?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a Geste, which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes, I cannot tell me of the Impressive, that Ankara will not reconciliation me at most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the craft, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in smile the smile, and he radiant little heat, even for his returning conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to his "love friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also said that relationships to Russia is not only return to the old level before the crisis, but even further improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a newspaper that peasan would have been increased, that would never be something worst.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would like to indicate the contrary to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable calmill showed that the State of Russia did not forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather it was the cause of crisis the first, which he mentioned in his introductory mentioned: the deposition of a Russian struggle on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reaction to the time was wuttered.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin was composed of and accused of Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The promise was even bigger because it was celebrated by a local friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The bag smoked back up again if not even impossible to be impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has been walked since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">The state of the state-controlled media have been controlled with unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once more, it would carry the door to bear all the shoulders for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the serious public officials were benefited from illegations officials that Erdogans had benefited from illeged oil trade in areas of Syriens, who received the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He did this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was therefore only instead, because Putin has received the President of the Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a trusted board is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is required in first line all friends that he can get back after the last month at a mistake almost his amtes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have been resolved him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Russian sanctions, Turkey made hard hard - especially the prohibition of charter fleets to bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a delight of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>

<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this as follows: "tourists there for long, tomatoes here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is based on the West, since it was considered the response to the verify masters as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose the outline of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping to go out of the cool sentiment to draw and the relationship of Turkey to the West Germany.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian Chief Apostle won a bonus that he was called for the selected state aid for the selected state aid.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-thought that itself is a devoted anxiety before regiming itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious Palace of the sea, Russia and Turkey, one of which once a analyser was once described, "Alliance of outsiders" in two countries that are surrounded by the west and poorly treated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow was recently given the role of peace than peace, but in Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be notable that after almost three hours of the first presidents, both Presidents on the press conference said that they had not striped once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey dismissed it to a question about their differences, while Putin was eliminated this too.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus, where a common glow can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect disaster, the NATO member of the Russian fighter jet abschoss - it certainly better that the two state efs at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="3">Since 1984, I joined at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turbo inside, Simone biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Hernandez, who inspired by many young girls from other skin.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman who is Jew Kocian, and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, abrands, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team reflects the USA against the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispan female presence at the top of this sports.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the last four years the number one was under the female turbo-American maker.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic and America at the last Olympic Games.</seg>

<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympiamannis only four turbo inside in the team is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that's more expensive sports and turboasts can be maintained in the first line in private turntables, which costs for training, integration, competition and hotel costs (for the trainer and their turbo and families). the list can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this turnouts lie in well-habilitated suburbs that support the shop.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these contracts, the Turner will receive a training and that is sufficient for families a single and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainress of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both their athletes, since then they started with the turbo.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired by the congregations of countless, young girls who inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired by a high performance and easier access.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel underwent immune system and wortheflex of a serious examination - by some of the dirtieth and most polluted places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk eways his traction on a Euro-string, a purge of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to represent the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before reading any object, he used a luminometer to show themselves and show us, on what he will rise.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was filmed with some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to cover the rinsing of a train toilet, which was already entirely impervious to impervious, but actually, in a kitchen unit more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical consultations relating to the funding of Darmbacteries, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, not left what he denied, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright is known to test the resistance of his Darms by giving the world traveled and stand-like as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinse of toilets, the task exhibited his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child was relatively unoccupied, what my health is concerned and I have turned all possible things in my mouth, earth, sausage and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie, he was repaired for his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing which he rejected, a tasty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test line showed an Luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminance number is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse its luminance of over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the travelling film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" that shows the bacterial number of different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the movie, he says: "that's the worst, what I have gered in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will tell us here, because it is here outside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will be held Mr. Wright with validated validates as well as vitamin C and D, to support the funding of Darmbacies and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer goods for some new products.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that explains the fascinating to see and simultaneously the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led the crazy Brainstormings by that we said, "Let's Ian call us."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is known to a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of only about the products, we wanted to present them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our daily surroundings, the meaning of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon in the documentary, we were able to provide consumers more information on an interesting type and fashion.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, I added me so say - I would have done my respect for Ian, when he would have done some of things that I have seen him as the ekelming Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, it was easier to bring it to them, Ian along with them to win them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these tasty paintings to film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a validated survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria were included in particular with the welfare of stomach and Darm and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that contain both lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood them.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Parliament election does not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the severely parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because he is not so far: summer holidays, heat and landing point fight - it is not so far.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who fought in the election of the election, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most common holiday, which are in the country, Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, no locals, may not choose the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">This includes practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the posters are spread, air balloons, Flyer split and at the end of the vote, only effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4th, 2016, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave once the voting for barely on the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say it, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also goes to something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is clearly surveys behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is cuts how strongly Neuling AfD abandoned and what at the end of Koalitionary remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government leaders, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, see one of his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels the country, distributed in Rosen and is a little with people, as it was even as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly engagated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In inqueries, S & D Euro MPs have at least 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfterD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD had already won clear with 35,6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="10">The citizen may now proceed from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="22">But that the B 27-restoration work carried out at them at net fractures, everyone who asks are asked to look.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some less is affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who produced with the "Enders" less to do so for other firms, which has hardly ever consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the car park Maier speaks Thomas Sulz from a "maximum slight decrease," spatial, but naturally "the mileage is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">At the strongest building the local district is along the strongest.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, is clear words.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I would have had a company with 4000 employees and would have had been react, the policy would have been react.</seg>

<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other land circuits, where something was generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all collages, Göhner is sure that its guest house will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been based on the long history since 1715 it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now prevented because of the complicated traffic in less often, it can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot come, it is also really nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the restoration work, Göhner did not return any doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction works for its biggest crisis that experienced its guest house in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="20">There are partly in itself: he is planning quick procedure for discoverings and more possibilities for inrefering human beings in front of departure.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted into the country, to make their smartphones and social media capabilities for a safety test.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the Dulce for rejected asylum seekers he wants to move some worse than to date - about such that penalties or their papers is to wear to wear their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legal radiated.</seg>
<seg id="24">It also affects uneven imperors and its questions is open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - for instance, the question of patience for example - is the question: what does this actually do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maicière, it is important to differentiate between the themes and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it's not able to speak in absence that the assassinter of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees were.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, many people took part in the high refugee camps for care about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that employ people were able to employ out times in the election cycle times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is immersed in focus.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the past days it went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garsty streetite about the equipment of the police, then about an uncertainty ideas collection, which also require a Burka-ban and a return of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maicière is tired here to reconciled tones.</seg>

<seg id="40">We have debate the discussion in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through Hobbysammers - it has a emotional meaning: older platform buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, would you follow me in the midst of a gift street in Soho, and wild stuffed, before I stand abide, my hands will stand and something gondering say, "so, let's throw us a seams."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent seller were able - is there as a handful fantastic record special.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to complete the camera for the next part in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops, and try to estimate their age and paintings.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I read from Sister Ray (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector if I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">This soundplates, above, (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed him to the house, and let the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has a considerable amount of albums and singles, the result of its available income: it is now able to buy used as it was released and again to buy items when he was sold, when he was young and Pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I purchase, are from the late 60ern, early 70s, who appeared as I was 11 or 12. things I was probably to buy something to buy them," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="20">He tuned that those who want to purchase the plates, rather, and added to this alone: "I smoke not and I'm not much too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my delaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people that are affected by the Medienhance, people who have heard about the comeback to purchase their old vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the discussions, I have led people in the rule around 1998 or 1999 their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once once sold their records to buy CDs, now their CDs to buy their records, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to the record of a certain universe.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the connected emotional significance of panels?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that tables have a soothing community of equivalents.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older clients will contact the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel being overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move the stability of confidential sound boards, from objects, happy young people.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it may have a spaces or possession of the possession as a type of Trost, says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like her social worker!" flaps are a staff of a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April unveiled that almost 50% of people who have bought a plate which have not heard it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was also found that 41% of a record players never have never use, while 7% of those who have a record, no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report I would probably look very pleased, while I had a stacks of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age), has noticed a "trophies" of the revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came out, and said," I have no record players, but I would like to buy a radiotead sound record, so I would like to put them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productloads, less muscles.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">That are younger people, not older, which can only be back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the Schallplatten is almost one whole floor, has a lower audience when I have cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, making photos, teenager and women mean age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere somewhat less relaxed than in the previous stores, - Wild Beasts latest version of experimental and sexually packed pop instead of experimental Jazz dryers from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity at the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks special, but nails of psychic traumata are hard to be badly determined, if you want to meet someone at least 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, running since some minutes in the business and viewed the Variables for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's rather a mannequin like a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not much so much, therefore the collecting is no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it operates with a love Seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said that a new generation of plate lovers will be inspired by Urban Outfitters:</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket, the jeans Hotpants to Mustern, watching a group of young teenagers who go for one moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter, a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees it to - perhaps because they are only pure decoration, some so far above that it is impossible to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnkey". "</seg>
<seg id="59">But in mind that each attraction for these objects more money for the industry mean and some customers to the depths of Sohos for more then, there is nothing to decide to decide.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's not surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the beyond that is most for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my imforations made, that the results of YouGov vote, leave it, at least in the table business in Soho, the great number of female collectors and plate lovers that exist in reality, record shops and online now, not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">This people work probably hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">You do not spend your Thursday morning with security through the bumming of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they knew of an unsecretary, 30-year old false Moderator, who had nothing fought against the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="9">I had blowing cancer, which is operide and did they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, spread it throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty good situation.</seg>

<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had happiness that he could start in early 2014, outside the season, what the interruption took place on a minimum, if this is under such circumstances of the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go again to me again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a lawful.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 foot, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it too much larger.</seg>

<seg id="5">You can not switch to TV the TV, read a newspaper or talking to the conversation of your neighbours, without more than Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the route between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who would be sent for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's 20 m with dimples, would have been sent by sponsors and well-feel-TV advertisement when it would be a swimmer, Turner or even Fallen.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic tramp of gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame illuminates not each event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade, sports sports, which are not generally accepted: airfield shooting, badminton, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and would like to rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I make reasonable reasonable for my certain love, then let me leave the attention to the discrete Charme of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp skip has been a Olympic event, as it was in Sydney since 2000, it was the last 16 years so much that I knew that I knew that there is a Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Igorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA, athletes sent to competition, it has never won a medal at the tramp of the tramp and made a athletes who made it up to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and the Canadian for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong in China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tramp skip has a certain external lateral cup, partially because it fits the unclarified ear passages for a Clownsschool as the for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am no expert, but only a little enthusiast am.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous quotation of its never shruined, but also the Grazie of the Turnens and diving, which combines two sports, which united it in essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline what so much means "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Exciting winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of falling movements (turning, Hrighteous and Saltos).</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official Olympiad program in accordance with execution, difficulty and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are compete in Rio mutually.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go towards gold, faster, go up and above, sometimes up to the target, sometimes up and back, upwards, and down below the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only the capellinie or the output, but in the tv-transmission also another cave: the world or the Olympiaroos.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted differnity is Nobel, admirable, even fanatically, and it's enough to take up an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also that which I would like to try for this games as a bit fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="30">It offers a respiratory break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the tramp-springers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or them pronounced down, apparent to effortlessly like a astronomer, then go down to the top, then effortlessly again after the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without trouble, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the cores, only the dreams of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and ends of women are held on Friday morning, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is dispatched the ends as part of a afternoon bloc of two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the amidst of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, which will probably translate in general tumult probably.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness is achieved only through the attacks and the objects of male athletes, as it recently pread the male US-Turner in accordance with the The Wall Street Journal again - then, Mr. Dooley expect its focus on air, new fan.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that Zig Protestant has killed during the intervention with the police acute.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid board of Western people with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government and continued even more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week storms thousands of people on the streets and the required fundamental policy changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Human Rights organisations, the answer was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that the policemen of unarmed demonstrators were killed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, probably from the last or early this year, show how security rod young people were propose to make this purpose, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now an incoming examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country, and in future it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and the stability of the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence service works closely together with Ethiopia in order to combat terrorism, in particular in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, even so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded the pace of pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendurance train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything like a preface for democracy - Human Rights organizations have continued the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been resolved to fights against silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or were killed in the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you have access and this no other options have to protest, breaks out of", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire Youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protest.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the floor up to the litters in regards to power the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a wide criticized election last year, the regional party and its allies were now 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the stresses along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zacked, controversial line called in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analytics that separatistas described as the Oromo-Liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were in the last years more or less beings, the turbulences were shooted and again and again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings after the years ago, Hinkanns under the surface is explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the past few years, many Ethiopia was able to communicate using the social media, as cheap smartphones are always more frequent and often improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government had access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still communicate over Internet proxies, which communicate them to keep it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia gave them to protests so too protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two major ethics in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since etching, Amharas, which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian universities, in politics and economy, while they live the Oromos of whom they are Muslims and in flat landalities.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are able to ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a guide of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and military services in the military intelligence, and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the invest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former Reborn leader, was up to his death in a non cricket illness in the year 2012, 17 years in Ethiopia Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was a tactical Genie, a man who could think around the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was particularly sealed in it, early signs of unsatisfaction and special commission to do your opponent and to do them.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing at this fundamental sick, said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analysis.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia of new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively small reasons to take place the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Differently as Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region Nordäthiopiens, Mr. Hailemariam from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyser say that he does not have confidence of the confidence of the Tigray security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many believed that the result may be pouring more blood.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was established in 2005 after thousands of elections against elections, according to the data of analyses apparent from the government, and afterwards stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razzies, many protestant were killed, even if it was less than in the last months, and this time he went out relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development expert loopian guides for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new pendullerite, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously unobvious that prevents the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month attacked onauditioned in gonads, a amharsh city, of Tigray, shops, and hatched to the Tigray in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyser say that the protests the United States and other Western Allies in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dron flights over the adjacent Somalia, even if they had recently closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West unique democracy wants to support democracy, he wants to pass that his prohibition in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Lord Abdi, "is a very thin difference."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland. Greenland: the oldest Swirt is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare view.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's Greenland usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return on board the Sanna's research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is weakened with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland preserve only with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an hour, the Greenland was flowing at the ground of the North Atlantic River, in an hour it comes just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five metre long animal on a mat 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a remote.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this sustained lifestyle lifestyle but seems to be a patisceps for a high age of age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in case of a Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Wahnsinn," said Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime, which means of vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the Evolutionsbiologist are already long as Greenland's Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland haenhaie are difficult to observe them in the ice-sea front of the thin coastal coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because it is water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, diving in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Above the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers have become a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time lupentempo Maes it when she went to Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seals, another had the pine nuts of a young iron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they slept animals or patrol on the reason of the ice meeres and seek Kadaver that made from higher waterfalls to lower torcles.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleague now 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013, the fishermen in Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North-lanes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of animals, they analyze them with the carbon-14 method the lens of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is already being built before the birth of the sharks which are not restored in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore be moved to the early 1960s, as a atomic purpose of larger quantities of this radioactive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the middle of 220 centimeters length of the smallest beasts of the Linsenkern, a low infusion of carbon-14 is trying to meet the nuclear weapon, it is expected to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland had a normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic ray in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimetres of Greenland was an age of 335 years, while the record shark was even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greathai-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were able to move the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters will be determined at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years, Greenland with the offspring obvious at least one half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also the same for vertebrates currently world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methodaleme primarily live in icy waters, is not a random.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, whose bacon started a 120 years old Harpoon tip, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures, the organism also runs there from live animals to asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you have later - and soulders slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm water in cold water, the animals are often especially large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a very small animal is endangered and should focus on it, preferably many offspring," explains the Evolutionsbiologist Sceuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big beast was invest to invest in a long life in long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The most recent mission with Kepler Weldreteleskop has helped astronomers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the Star of Plejades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars in constellation can be rotated, as well as in which context the rotational periods with the planet stand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that we learn more about the relation between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Plejaden is located 445 lightyears from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach an adult age.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn right now on the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since this winch has travel through the magnetic fields of your stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star altert, its rotation rate begins to slowdown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by taking the time between the appearing of a recognisable stellations -- such as sunflecken -- recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that massive stars slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebel compares the stars with tables, whereby larger stars slower slopes are lower than smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Plethades we see that sends rotors to be a massive, whither to be faster rotors to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers from the press malware, currently targeted businesses at - and are successfully successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of the malware infection specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of these companies have been at least once, partially several victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a Ransomware-press.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were paid by the perpetrators of the valleys required to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their erpressing software according to observations of Malwarebytes based on attacks in the company sites.</seg>
<seg id="7">They will succeed there, the potential ranty was significantly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we observe a simple fast evolution of contaminating software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 the most moulds were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only, private users were the goal but the change was reckened rapidly during the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a Opfers, she looks fumbled files like about Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives photos and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the original sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software will be the receivables of the press compressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to receive the extension code to the files, the sacrificible money is usually survived in the form of the cryptocurrency bitcoin - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private use the personal picture database is on the game, it is available for sensitive customer data or project databases, without production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off if a Ransomware is eaten.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies caused by Ransomware, 13 percent, even had to break the business activities, in a case of people were insured.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attack patients whose patients were threatened by the loss of nakened nations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims: pays not, you have been promoted to this problem, explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who numbers have to get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to settle the requirement of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker also know that and try everything to build a good Reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security forcement of F-Secure has examined the user surface and the contact with the expressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are trying to take a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay via bitcoin, you can freely allow freely accessible support sites or decrypt example.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will redeemed private captains according to payments of a few hundred euro, the company you have to negotiate hard and five-digit sum to get their data encode.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risk-up profits are the hacker always professional and share the work, explains security chester Wisniewski from the Internet provider Sophos: "one single person can write an Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their compensation software then in the form of a software design to the actual Erpressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The new cloud kits produced by winning the malware, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Delivery includes a adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, function and fire can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The press release is then looking for another hacker to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in an services industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">For example, in one of the foreground, buying the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on the many PCs as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment takes place per induced computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"normally, the Crimines then carry spammer with the spread of spreading, declared Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that their data is better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT responsibility in the Malwarebytes-survey trust the Ransomware of file-ups and Scannerssoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already tested.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is no adequate threat for successful income more than customer lists or quotations, such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the compensation potential depending on the type of data is even more than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Too, the perpetrators could be completely new goals in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrates the Security Council, how they were able to receive a thermostat with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the freeze of a derart blocked heating could be worth a money.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the valleys then, instead of the heating in the future a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be used in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="8">So some - less spotted than much more on the number of emerging areas - common, when the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We searched an administrative capacity with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in the field of social work, one eierlegende Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the administrative work is not a central area, mean Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially to organize organization, work with people in front of site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been working for around six weeks.</seg>

<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection installation.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate refugees in their own or appropriate residence.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of this accommodation need to bear the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities changed to the local community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner will offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto takes place any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work yet, it is to be assigned to private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">So they must be intentiful apartments, as well as it is so nice.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washenstrasse.</seg>

<seg id="37">Humans have to develop a satisfaction of experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do it offers such as sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also skip here administration and honorary law.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling that they are wished in Germany in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long time of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain the refugees that it will take, and it takes care of meantime, for example with language course.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who executes any feeling that he could not help to help you in Urbach, will not work and be uncontactor, who will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem is there, but there are customer, "people, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and client is always there, other to motivate.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this be a "mammoth job."</seg>

<seg id="56">In the background, they are always in the background that soon a new jobs will come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer any policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is impossible to place them Helping.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there where we want to pass," says Annika Euschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that the situation would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer makes also clearly that the Urbacher also have to integrate the previous people to integrate this people.</seg>
