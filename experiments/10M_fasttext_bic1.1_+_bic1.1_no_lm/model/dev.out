8 Rem@@ un@@ quest@@ i@@ oned trying to take a Donald Tr@@ ump .
some have tried to fire it as flop .
others have done him as a jo@@ ke .
and some waiting for a coll@@ ap@@ se .
but no matter how some pub@@ lic@@ ans att@@ empt@@ ed to pull Donald Tr@@ ump with sur@@ ve@@ ys for down@@ wards , it doesn &apos;t work ( still ) .
ten of the last eleven national sur@@ ve@@ ys show Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask what it means that for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ g@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election .
none pro@@ claims that Tr@@ ump probably win the repub@@ li@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts believe that at this time in 2011 , Rick &apos;s Gu@@ err@@ ys was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which none was only a state in the nom@@ inees process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice .
but in foreign groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conserv@@ ative , economic group Club for Gro@@ wth now recogni@@ ze tr@@ um@@ ps through and start making their dollar fine to fight him .
here are some current circum@@ st@@ ances that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Get@@ ting values have to rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidates in mid @-@ June , showed a survey of the Mon@@ mouth col@@ lege that only saw two from ten Republi@@ can among the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
until mid July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ can have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
approximately three of ten tell that they have a negative mind .
and these numbers are in early countries .
a fifth p@@ pi@@ ac @-@ tuning in I@@ owa has notic@@ ed last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thir@@ ds of GO@@ P @-@ W@@ vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either del@@ igh@@ ted &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two out of 10 , they were w@@ ished , when he would be the candidate .
only Ben Carson creates about the same term such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent tell it , it would be &quot; vs. 40 percent , who tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of research ?
Marco Rub@@ io with only 21 percent .
on the other side , 47 percent of the repub@@ li@@ can vot@@ ers say that it would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favour@@ ite of Est@@ abl@@ ish@@ ments , the candidate would be .
a majority of the Republi@@ can cannot see Tr@@ um@@ ps Tem@@ per@@ ament no problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump ra@@ ises on its b@@ omb@@ ing and ins@@ eri@@ dian statements , 52 percent of the Republic of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l had the right Tem@@ per@@ ament for a President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first vote state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans think he did the person@@ ality of a princ@@ es , according to the qu@@ in@@ oa h@@ ac last week .
however , think about 44 percent , that he should not run the pers@@ onal@@ isation , and almost six of 10 independent , that his Tem@@ per@@ ament does not lead to the White House PA@@ SSE , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can wines are used to idea the idea .
if they put their money loop , the repub@@ li@@ can vot@@ ers sc@@ ump sum up .
if they are quest@@ i@@ oned , who g@@ aining the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump sum is the best bet .
this is a change since that time , when four of July , her money was made to Je@@ b Bush .
complete re@@ design : GO@@ P vot@@ ers had not stri@@ pped in the past in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ can prove that Rick Perry would gain the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers have still notic@@ ed as pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble campaign in a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers .
even if the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around a different candidates , Tr@@ ump sug@@ ge@@ sts just almost each .
some professionals are accept@@ ing that the fail@@ ure field probably contri@@ butes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ us@@ ly distributed than a do@@ zen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hy@@ p@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump were har@@ vest@@ ed with majority .
he has before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points pre @-@ spr@@ ung , before Marco Rub@@ io 14 points , before altogether 15 points , before E@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge of Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
there is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that stri@@ kes him ?
Ben Carson would get the entre@@ pren@@ eur with 19 points in a hy@@ p@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race .
a little majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that she made their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reve@@ als that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump that they have been awarded their voices .
of course , you can do much to change that , and no@@ body can say nothing to change the mind .
46 percent said that they must leave the door to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps has the stron@@ gest competition at the moment of the other outdoor sm@@ ite , the neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Carson , but vot@@ ers who say that they have formed their opinion , often more often for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ can tell that they agre@@ e with Tr@@ ump on immig@@ ration .
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign in front of two months immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ed &quot; was the immig@@ ration and a matter of public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concern@@ ed that the b@@ omb@@ astic relationship of Tr@@ ump is dec@@ is@@ ive in the Republi@@ can party of the Republi@@ can party and is damaged the re@@ ori@@ ental efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey conducted by mon@@ day , six out of 10 Re@@ pub@@ lics kept them with tr@@ ump of immig@@ ration .
so long as it remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it will also do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration beyond the government cli@@ mb@@ s at new high@@ s .
meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump , and Ben Carson became the half of the repub@@ li@@ can government , mainly by their external b@@ iter status .
six of 10 Republi@@ can say in the new mon@@ day pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they want to make a political outdoor sm@@ urf@@ ers as someone with government experience .
and they are also w@@ ager on Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa on two weeks shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Republi@@ can be fru@@ stated on the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans and the Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; with 54 percent &quot; in@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; dev@@ ast@@ ated . &quot;

this percentage was the fastest and aff@@ lic@@ ated assessment over the time of an interest in turnover since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar of $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,49 % on 6.@@ 229@@ ,@@ 21 .

the managing director of JD Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum w@@ age for UK workers &quot; would signi@@ fy more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is impossible that this purchasing power is the higher working cost by the firm , he says .
the cost could enter the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Met@@ cash starts temporary @-@ campaign campaign towards comb@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - inc@@ ident
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA Fili@@ ale before a Al@@ di @-@ Up@@ mar@@ sch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food large dealer Met@@ cash has started a temporary campaign to def@@ end the market share of I@@ GA retail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia in the field of a 700 million $ Al@@ di inv@@ asion .
while Al@@ di the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia stores their rel@@ ations@@ hips with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am @-@ marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA t@@ aler and suppliers Break on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ aker Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bo@@ rough , who distributed in I@@ GA liver fresh and charge shop , the remaining tickets for the South Australian football League for loy@@ alty clients .
it is expected to obtain further details of his defence strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ alers for food , alcohol and devices will pass through its annual invest@@ ors .
it is a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA charge stores and higher profit as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network generated in the Eastern states .
purchasing shares in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
but anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all available retail@@ ers , but mainly independent retail@@ ers sales will take away .
one week published in this week published by Tom K@@ ier@@ ath von Morgan Stan@@ ley , that I@@ GA retail@@ ers might lose around $ 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million until the end of 2016 .
these forecast based on the ass@@ um@@ ption that Al@@ di will be opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food industry and the amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs might cost a amount of around CHF 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time the Met@@ cash market share in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey was found out of Roy Morgan , I@@ GA bu@@ yers are the most tre@@ ble .
Morgan Stan@@ ley particip@@ ates in the food and groc@@ ery store around 3.8 per cent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2017 will drop to 10.3 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fond@@ ation Camp Ham@@ ish Dou@@ ma , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will dis@@ appear within one decade .
Met@@ cash withdraw@@ al it to re@@ act the comments on the comments of Mr Dou@@ ma .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ ma last week will be recorded .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has decreased from 18 per cent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retail , who is about 1,200 of I@@ GA retail@@ ers , has dropped by 43 percent in 2012 , which is refl@@ ected at the same time pressure on revenues and mar@@ gen .
however , the whol@@ es@@ ale and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to improve the prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths of hundreds of products each week and improve their shops by faster growing fresh food and a better choice of private label fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice is believed to make the price adjust@@ ments and shop re@@ hab@@ il@@ itation . ho@@ pes that the whol@@ es@@ alers will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian Gold Association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is des@@ er@@ ves more Lo@@ b as crit@@ ic@@ ism for his behavi@@ or .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damage in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and des@@ er@@ ves to view the president of the Australian tennis courts Steve Heal@@ y more Lo@@ b as crit@@ ic@@ ism for his own behavi@@ or .
Coc@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the tal@@ ented Duos , which is always re@@ ferred to as &quot; Special Ks &quot; standing by the not@@ ori@@ ous editions of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in a fi@@ ery trials in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opp@@ onents Ryan Har@@ rison will strike twice through the ar@@ bit@@ rat@@ ors , where Har@@ rison would suggest : &quot; WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA had to beat K@@ yr@@ gios , and I should suggest the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how to dis@@ mant@@ led a tennis r@@ acket after a pot@@ ic@@ ing US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , the co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of Heal@@ y has def@@ ended .
the teen@@ ager is currently being Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in sing@@ les , behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in Davis Cup semi final against Britain .
&quot; a thing that I was pretty much shorter , is the fact that after my view was there a little in the battle , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has a r@@ acket broken , when he lost his first player to the US Open , but he is not the first player who cr@@ ises a m@@ all@@ ets with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi was good enough to know that he is not proud .
but , really , he really shows in the US Open extremely well , even under the rather prov@@ oc@@ ative circum@@ st@@ ances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think that he ear@@ ns a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around it , he has a great family around , and I believe that he has a little too str@@ eng .
he is a very tear 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and a young guy , and I believe that he ear@@ ns it to be ass@@ essed according to his own services .
Heal@@ y supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gios did not answer to consider that on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the correct for all , but he as@@ sures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team will be foc@@ used on the competition , and not on all the contro@@ versi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick could have made the Asc@@ ension into the eyes of the public , and he des@@ er@@ able to do all the crit@@ ic@@ ism , which he could think it to do , in which he can only think it , and it is best for the crew , and it is best for the crew , and it is best for the crew .

more than five months before the beginning of the court , say most dem@@ ographic elections that it is too early to say that their opinion is to ass@@ ist that candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supp@@ or@@ ters are in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ Survey , Clinton has lost several earnings for dem@@ ographic groups since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and moder@@ ated , but this jum@@ ps have reduced .
your support in men is clear , and Sand@@ ers is here only with 5 points .
clinical benefit from democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has escap@@ ed , and Sand@@ ers are now at the same level .
Clinton has yet another great advantage in the older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton in front of Sand@@ ers with a double @-@ digit of the Liber@@ als , but Sand@@ ers now has a 5 @-@ point lead during this group .
approximately half of the democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers will say that she would support her enthusi@@ as@@ m in Clinton when she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservation and further 15 percent would support them only because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not sur@@ prising , Clin@@ tons current supp@@ or@@ ters above all of you are del@@ ight .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently support in Clinton - just about a quarter would thr@@ ust it .
during the 48 percent of democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers the elections that they support Clinton with enthusi@@ as@@ m , tell less repub@@ li@@ can vot@@ ers with Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if using Clin@@ tons supp@@ or@@ ters in an open question , why they want it is the most frequently answer to that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is a female President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate to job ( 10 percent ) .
Clin@@ tons supports also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
con@@ sent to de@@ aling with problems and counter versions are also c@@ ited .
since the Vice @-@ president has a potential for the presid@@ ential suite , 57 percent of democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although a third body believed that it should not do it .
if democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers are sc@@ anned , who would be the party for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top of the party .
tr@@ acked tags will say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of the second choice in front of Sand@@ ers .
deci@@ des , did not deci@@ de to di@@ cul@@ ate the nom@@ ination of the Democrats Group , Hill@@ ary Clinton @-@ spr@@ ung in front of Sand@@ ers , of 20 points with bi@@ den in the race , 30 points without him in the race .
fift@@ e@@ fifty percent of democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as candidate to win the election , however , this figure is dropped from 78 per cent in the last month .
be@@ aker is at a distance of this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; chosen &quot; .
nevertheless , at question afterwards , what is more import@@ antly for a candidates , call the vot@@ ers of vot@@ ers questions about counter .
similar to the last month , there is no single democ@@ rati@@ cally candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers as un@@ accept@@ able .
the democ@@ ratic candidates or potential candidates take good results at some important characteristics of vot@@ ers of their party .
view from Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and conf@@ identi@@ ality and conf@@ identi@@ ality with strong guides .
be@@ ats cut off the three candidates at best in hon@@ ors , while Clin@@ tons strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers think that Clinton is hon@@ est and conf@@ id@@ ential wor@@ thy : twice as many say the above Sand@@ ers ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent have no opinion from him .
vot@@ ers of the vot@@ ers see in general also Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Bi@@ bes ide@@ olog@@ ically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , there is no opinion of the democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers no opinion of Sand@@ ers .
due to Hill@@ ary Clinton , using a personal email address and a server during the term as Minister &apos;s Foreign Minister , are the most democ@@ ratic vot@@ ers will be satisfied with their declaration of aff@@ air and say that it does not aff@@ ect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of Americ@@ ans is now un@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was light .
most Americ@@ ans told , that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , even though 36 percent said , their opinion was still post@@ eri@@ or@@ ated .
mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 , who say that their views from Clinton have become bad .
although from the n@@ arr@@ ator of their party as hon@@ est and conf@@ id@@ ential wor@@ thy , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
the vot@@ ers required 62 percent of vot@@ ers do not stop for a hon@@ or@@ able and conf@@ identi@@ ality person .
at the same time 55 percent of vot@@ ers were not too high as dem@@ enti@@ ful and not conf@@ id@@ ential wor@@ thy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump received good notes at the guided tour .
out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Carson and Bush lists at best conditions .
a majority a majority see Sand@@ ers rather than hon@@ est , but as at Carson have many no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample rate of 351 democ@@ ratic states is 6 percentage points .

five members of br@@ other@@ hood with death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a delic@@ ac@@ eful v@@ itu@@ als as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ kl@@ agen is filed against five .
members of the New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ del@@ ta @-@ Bru@@ other@@ hood att@@ acked her transport to the hospital as in September 2013 , and del@@ ayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death .
civil servants , let him be loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack of full sand , and repe@@ at@@ edly rec@@ ti@@ fied , while he att@@ empt@@ ed to pass through a certain order .
Mr. Den@@ g kl@@ ag@@ te finally fell about he@@ ada@@ che , then he fell con@@ sci@@ ousness .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ 504 def@@ ects did not call the emergency number 911 , after re@@ mot@@ ely became an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police took it .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms at goo@@ gle , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Br@@ other@@ hood to contact Council , said by Chris Wagner , on a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members , U@@ tens@@ ilien began to hide and established the condition of the br@@ other@@ hood fundam@@ ent@@ ally about the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said of police Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ve not revi@@ ved , and he died in the morning at the next morning .
after a Auto@@ p@@ seven court , Den@@ g repeated armed with st@@ um@@ atic strength viol@@ ations of head , hull and th@@ ig@@ hs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ik@@ anen by Br@@ other@@ hood . at least a student died in the Sch@@ ik@@ ane , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney at the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
br@@ other@@ ho@@ ods and their members must be de@@ duc@@ ted to the calculated , and this step by authorities is very important .
an County Grand Jury of Monroe recom@@ men@@ ds an indictment due to murder of third degree for the first five members .
two thousand members of the br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with ch@@ ic@@ ing attacks and formation of a cri@@ min@@ atory association .
&quot; we do not want to take part only the participating persons , but if there has been an organization that will be form@@ ally or un@@ official - this will also be in the comp@@ uting power , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the br@@ other@@ hood , and the national br@@ other@@ hood decided to re@@ tri@@ ck his power to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
an interest in capital increase , and the hous@@ ings will have re@@ fu@@ elling at the W@@ aver &apos;s return , and the economy will slip during a rec@@ ession .
we know this .
what we know not know how long does all last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy features only low instructions for the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a rec@@ ession came within just 11 months after the first interest of interest and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates are often , if the economy does not always re@@ act as the economy and the financial investments .
thus , Re@@ present@@ atives of the US Central Bank would have strongly wor@@ ried that invest@@ ors will not increase it when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather in the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables a role .
however , at the end , market bor@@ row@@ ers could however be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an exc@@ essi@@ ve incidence .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be ref@@ used to interpre@@ t some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap scope of &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ ome at Capital Economics , in a press release .
in contrast to this , we do not expect to make an up@@ coming return of the US interest at normal heights but still at a low level to se@@ em to se@@ em to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there is no effect .
here is an overview of historical trends for current trends - how some areas of the economy might be re@@ act :
as the market last month , the prec@@ urs@@ ement of interest increases things for a while keeping .
once the increase does not hits the influence is a dram@@ ati@@ cally .
&quot; there are seems to be a tend@@ ency that evalu@@ ates wealth produced 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank &apos;s anal@@ ysts in a recent study showing what happens to interest increases for F@@ ed .
in the past 35 years , the market is at the up@@ ward trend in the up@@ ward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest in the past six years , with an average yield in the past six years , with an average yield of 14.4 percent after a current analysis , the Bob Doll , Chief Town Strat@@ os was published at Nu@@ v@@ een Ass@@ et Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks will occur incre@@ as@@ ingly in the Hig@@ her cycle , and the r@@ ent@@ ite will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essi@@ ons are a fact of the economic , but interest increases they often exceed .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not be acceler@@ ated before and which could acceler@@ ate a rec@@ ession .
extremely not@@ ew@@ or@@ thy is that the gross national product is close to its lowest point at an interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases , only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , a few that this and@@ au@@ rs is expected to be at Atlanta F@@ ed for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
one of interest increases with a quest@@ ion@@ able economic cul@@ isse could be risk and throw the question that this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market share is made up for a whole year at the end of the f@@ ed , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week .
during many strateg@@ ies and econom@@ ist believe that FO@@ MC may increase an increase in this meeting , there are only an prob@@ ability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the increases cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing sw@@ elling at the GDP will take place and were very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadow , &quot; so the report .
in contrast , this is clearly a slow slow recovery of what is the wor@@ st rec@@ ession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is the longest one who has been waiting since the fin@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ l , as the market takes place an interest in the market , and the pattern was quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than if shares when their strategic course .
when lending the return to change the direction once the first increase in the cycle is done .
at the end of the increase working cycle , the bor@@ rowing should fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ies of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase of interest rates will lead to make changes between long and shorter bonds and turn around the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds are often anticip@@ ated in such climate and even though , &quot; we are still clear , higher income expected , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ anal@@ ysts in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it &apos;s interesting to know that the markets are already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
in addition to the strength of the Dollars and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prosp@@ erous monetary policy &quot; wrote them . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates experienced , the Er@@ l@@ ace is flat , credit lines increased considerably , and the flo@@ at@@ ility increased - everything &apos;s characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has strengthened its strategy .
in the big and all , companies have w@@ rap the bigger part of their business activities in the USA , that will benefit from interest rates and local products .
mult@@ in@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high school will be wor@@ se , as a growing dollar is more expensive on the global market . and likewise the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story indicates that &quot; quality - &quot; shares in addition to re@@ act , three months after an initial interest in excess , said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customer .
companies with strong balance sheet companies with slow balance sheet according to each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average 5 percentage points .
company with high capital margin as well as low volume deposits with their shares even exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts are a large problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose most , in gold they said .
outside the real stock play , consumers are also benefit by the increasing dollars .
as@@ parag@@ us could see earnings by higher income , even if professionals are different , such as fast that will be held .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liamentary Member Andrew B@@ ingham
conserv@@ ative and Member of the Parliament critical hits the transmitter due to its &quot; Ver@@ d@@ umm@@ ing &quot;

he decided to meet with his colle@@ ague and co @-@ def@@ endants to take these task .
with all risks .
&quot; we decided to take money our life insurance than security at the Bank , he said in the influence .
with the association it has been agreed , you can manage the money for free , there must be no school made .
in addition , - for the appropriate financial success - the payout of expenses from the expenses were adopted by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expenses only came out later , nam@@ ely from the year 2003 , when a plus on the account has been paid out .
thus , a fixed and non @-@ detail entries , the former Ob@@ mann explains the processes .
the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us managed the two accused , compl@@ eting the second accused .
why the out@@ flow of the society was not detailed in detail , the judge asked the judge .
the club is not interested in detail for the financial aff@@ ection , important is only the debt of debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 , against the offici@@ als of the investigation , a total amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club team .
the be dropped , declared the accused .
this imp@@ urities account did not run on the name of the second accused , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge of the judge .
so did the respond@@ ents knew no answer .
then he spake , he supposed that this was the best for the association . &quot;
if him something is wrong , no@@ body would have been some of this money , ordered the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the Mit@@ ch@@ cl@@ ag@@ te was report@@ edly informed , just@@ ified the function .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; poll@@ ut@@ ants &quot; def@@ ects .
why case of poll@@ ut@@ ants ? , wanted jud@@ ged and prosec@@ utor possible .
this was the first accused , having been underst@@ ood with this form@@ ulation , because the club has never been written in an damage .
but what should I do when the law@@ yer says : &quot; with whom you are all of the Schneider . &quot;
&quot; I am a legal agent ? &quot; he asked them . &quot;
in addition , the Func@@ tion@@ aries said , He never got a cent sal@@ ary sal@@ ary , it turns only money and po@@ ets .
on Di@@ pli@@ ers he added the club 1,000 euros per month in bill , the actual effort , but was a lot higher , he added .
the exact documents for the early years were not able to have def@@ endants .
these are after a working trial , in which all had been jud@@ ged that no longer has been kept , declared them .
od@@ ology money had also occupied the second accused .
all Beh@@ avi@@ or are carried out in cash , he explained from his residence of Pe@@ op@@ ort on the Bank to Ab@@ or@@ burg , in his testim@@ ony .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September by the survey of witnesses .

Zeit of your decision on interest rates for the US code
the world wat@@ ched when the US @-@ requirement is seen on two days , on Wedn@@ esdays and Thurs@@ days to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since a decade of interest , or not .
a survey conducted by Reu@@ ters , who had been asked if a little more than half the last week of view was that F@@ ed would do so now , that the F@@ ed will still be longer a bit longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 per cent .
it is an historic event because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest has set on N@@ ULL .
for the first time we approach a situation in which a great central bank may well leave the zero point and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel L@@ aut , Leit@@ z employees at the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the f@@ ed can not ign@@ ore the less ro@@ vic@@ ts forecast for global conditions .
she has war@@ ned the markets that indicate an increase , but the signs suggest that the ch@@ ances are good for such steps .
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday

the police asked the p@@ ru@@ by after his name , but he gave him not .
indeed , there was no declaration for his nuts .
when the police was found the scene , they found the bodies by Am@@ y Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Mat@@ y , 45 , who wanted to do it , &quot; I wanted to do it , I could do it .

the University of President William La@@ For@@ ge spoke nothing of a conflict between E. and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something to Mr Lam@@ bs Introduction . &quot;
in sp@@ ite of reports on Monday , it was supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , said , &quot; no information , no evidence , &quot; no information &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who had been married about seven years , known as a &quot; good man . &quot;

LUKE Sh@@ aw from Manchester United can not play a monthly par@@ is@@ per for double freight structure
in Manchester at the Champions League @-@ defe@@ at of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , a double freight structure of his right banks .
while this is the left of the way to turn left and closing him for at least six months from play , Louis van G@@ aal is the hope that Sh@@ aw can play in this season .
the inj@@ ury was caused by a decline attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sh@@ aw dis@@ appeared in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and included oxygen which was brought into the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has twice a double bed structure and is at the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then put in Manchester .
it is a terri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very heavy , and then it &apos;s fantastic .
in the dressing unit he had a oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I am not a doctor but if you have a double fr@@ actions , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno wel@@ comes happy to escape a Red card and susp@@ ending a penalty .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the ar@@ bit@@ ration , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican Indi@@ ans .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ator had to be wit@@ ness@@ ed .
you can ass@@ ess yourself , when I say that a penalty meter and a red card were random@@ ly .
it was a very wor@@ se attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sh@@ all account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words , I cannot describe what way to go to gen@@ esis , I am coming back again . &quot;
based on : Manchester United bl@@ ends the loss of Luke Sh@@ aw at the defe@@ at at PS@@ V

it &apos;s never the int@@ ent of our players to viol@@ ate a opp@@ onent .

for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see , was the ball who had seen in another direction , so it was seeing &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had never tou@@ ched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S6 she Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it fe@@ els like it , I know how many can be so anything .

certainly David Camer@@ on The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that loves all parents : if your child is a book , it will not take it until you know it almost .
it was perhaps David Camer@@ on .
when he was asked to call a provider of child care systems , his favorite children book was decided to escape the Federal Minister of The Lor@@ ax in 1971 near Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Camer@@ on to a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun@@ ny , event@@ ual , creative and with a powerful message , there is a book that I would like to give my children or a message that we would have been able to have so far . &quot;
all beautiful and good , except for the following article , in Camer@@ on the diagram , in which Camer@@ on alle@@ ge@@ dly describes the release of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to enlar@@ ge the pretty short original text .
&quot; the surrounded by the city of Th@@ ink @-@ Ville , where all nature emerg@@ ed and even the air named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , to see her wish to be a real tree , whose real name was published by Theodor Se@@ uss Ge@@ is@@ el and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not ext@@ ent enough , if the mist@@ ake of the Lor@@ ax film that will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a to@@ wing , ho@@ pes to win a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he wants to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems that Camer@@ on seems that Camer@@ on caused the wr@@ ist of happ@@ iness , like the local environment , despite the prot@@ ests of the nam@@ e@@ verl@@ asting Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ enden , fast be@@ ings , &quot; which says in the name of the trees , &quot; dev@@ ast@@ ated it .
most likely probably was a relatively low PR task to carry it a hel@@ per team that The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing Street inter@@ phone said that the text probably came to Camer@@ on &apos;s election design .
Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ on employees , but there was no further acqu@@ ain@@ able comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clear from the exp@@ ul@@ sion from UK team , but it is still difficult
on Pakistan in the United Arab Emir@@ ates , there is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the k@@ ader , England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not close a down@@ ward movement .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks Site is possibly less than the three years ago , but there are good sp@@ in players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , only one jug@@ end positive setting .
with the ball become Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is based on this product : Adam Ly@@ th s@@ its out of the England test K@@ ader , and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course also for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analy@@ ze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime player are foc@@ used on results .
there were no product signs for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I have said these things - players are their own best de@@ vot@@ ers .
long ago , one would charge the run of ly@@ re , but he had over his own fate when he pro@@ claimed their own fate .
if he ho@@ pe@@ fully win further races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , an additional chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor of Bay@@ l@@ ite pra@@ ised his attitude , even if it was not so good performance , and sur@@ pris@@ ed me not ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test ed@@ mann will receive , in order to set his characters , it is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven ch@@ ances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - who was Nick Com@@ pt@@ on in nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only design that can be ordered that England was first in Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but when Ly@@ th was in Europe but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex Hal@@ es comes up , and he is a stroke of a stroke which I got up .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ p@@ tive players , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire , early in this season , when he had place 236 of us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very well .
he must receive at least the same ch@@ ances as before him , but this depends on the team picture in the United Arab Emir@@ ates .
the idea , Mo@@ een apart from Cook resulted in order to bring a extra sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and then bought four qui@@ icks , and I did not change anything .
I see not why a stroke has not strike there , and this Lef@@ th@@ and has already shown that he is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ersh@@ ire , but there is no number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at first drop before starting in 2001 .
he has managed thirty hundred cents and did not return it .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the f@@ ader as back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner in and in my lim@@ iting handling with him as a young man im@@ pressed me .
people can possibly see his statistics , on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ ets and 35 with the ball - and think there is a p@@ unk , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who have their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few big additions on the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ d@@ ene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consult@@ ant for the test cycles could be a master &apos;s coup .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est not@@ ches of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience in all conditions and against all attacks against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes up for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he created for the International Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as Coach , and how Mah@@ ela has prosp@@ ects , of which we can profit .
sometimes , new voices can bring new voices in the dressing of fresh wind , even if the messages were in harmon@@ y with the previously .
Coll@@ ys te@@ am@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , will not be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some are not yet voices , but co@@ aches and te@@ am@@ bul@@ ance do not determine the ti@@ met@@ able .
and you must remember that , as they will dep@@ end their jobs from the results .
such dec@@ isions are not taken by light heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ ite Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain &apos;s Great Britain ) could be regul@@ ated to obtain the economy by the economy by 2017 .
David Camer@@ on un@@ ited new strategy , to keep the Great Britain in the EU , with every day de@@ eper in trouble , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , dedicated to Europe on Tuesday .
fore@@ ign@@ ers also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
a European diploma @-@ fre@@ und said that some affili@@ ates , as low de@@ stri@@ ped in various cr@@ ises as the EU is now and not always created out of own debt , Great Britain &apos;s agenda , and inter@@ ference changes , they usually do not want to do .
in Brig@@ h@@ ton the TU@@ C decided to leave the TU@@ C at her annual meeting , that it does not want the social protection to the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .

it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes you on the outside of the UK inside the EU Zel@@ ate , &quot; Let us not look back with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you find out more and more short minister and offici@@ als in some main cities until the point where we are going to go or go .
in Germany , German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an al@@ lies , but it has passed since 10 years before power and wants to be po@@ or@@ ly for them how to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long y@@ ou@@ ds such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) happened .

he is also a associated force .
Poland could possibly see a nation@@ alist political government , Spain .
it &apos;s difficult to ensure that in order to ass@@ emble the sel@@ f@@ ie br@@ ites to avoid their energy , out there should be better to prevent the Sc@@ ott@@ ish Austr@@ ali@@ zing out of the UK - anything they do not want to have the most similar separ@@ atist@@ ic tend@@ encies .
therefore , some such min@@ isters even would optimi@@ ze clearly confidence notes , completely in SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s refer@@ end@@ um@@ campaign 2017 , in order to acceler@@ ate the re@@ x@@ ite process , probably my friend .
&quot; the re @-@ shop was a p@@ le@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has nothing of the value from the new shop . &quot;
Europe@@ ans know how r@@ ush the Fle@@ et Street to their cost , and which EU Sc@@ ep@@ tics is the Oli@@ gar@@ ch@@ ie der Press Conference in 1975 , but not that our entry was included in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember with Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opp@@ ort@@ unities , who remember a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ le @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respond@@ ent in early 90 @-@ years .

this belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers of countries and the ps@@ eu@@ do non @-@ in@@ land that have most of our big newspapers .
actually , Tony Bl@@ air worked similar to them , but found that if you sat with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better to di@@ pped him , instead of course its lunch and dinner .
in fact , M@@ ai@@ ri@@ aner b@@ ordered more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself served as Camer@@ on refer@@ ee , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle of the EU , which was rej@@ ected by the French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 that it was opened to him a back@@ door .

experts Crit@@ eri@@ ze report by public Health England on E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tion of a state financial agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes f@@ ewer than smoking origin@@ ated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections for the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , writing by the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et is appe@@ aring in their report by public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; fundam@@ ental report &quot; in last month and describes it as a comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however some researchers have set the load capacity of the data and proved to the connections between some professionals and tobacco industry .
an item in the Lanc@@ aster Lanc@@ et last month the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny basis &quot; on the P@@ he founded his principal concl@@ usions .
two further researchers have been asked to BM@@ J and have asked whether the asser@@ tion &quot; can build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin McK@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygi@@ ene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ew@@ ell , Professor for Clin@@ ical Epi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strateg@@ ies should be based on the det@@ ecti@@ veness of eff@@ ecti@@ veness . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less har@@ m@@ ful than smoking &quot; in a detailed review of the method and mod@@ eling .
indeed , these statements made out of a single session of 12 people , which were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria for decision @-@ ma@@ kers ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria intervals - MC@@ DA ) , to lead its sessions about the damage of various Nik@@ ot@@ in @-@ hal@@ ve products ; the results of the meeting was combined in a research report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ew@@ ell said that a spons@@ or of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was given by British American Tob@@ acco Factory ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of B@@ AT to Public Health in a sustainability report , said it .
one of the 12 atten@@ de@@ es declared to the meeting , funds of a e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturers said , but not the financing that he agreed upon the report before the Works company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the Gre@@ at@@ um will not be delivered , but also includes several well @-@ known E @-@ c@@ ettes @-@ Champions , from which some also includes some branches on paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
in the meeting there were also the tobacco over of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work may be called &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria , &quot; Sign@@ ed and Cap@@ er@@ ally .
however , no such connections or restri@@ ctions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ew@@ ell told that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; so far have no evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes is as a way to smoking a king for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of Health and W@@ ELL@@ NESS at P@@ he told , told that the asser@@ tion of BM@@ J was re@@ active previously .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less har@@ m@@ ful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smo@@ ker dies on his Su@@ cht .
all evidence sug@@ ge@@ sts that the health risk of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes in comparison should be small but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique oblig@@ ation to the information about the public , which demonstr@@ ate it , and what is not , especially when it gives so@@ unding a lot of public administration on the tobacco d@@ ang@@ ers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die every year on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking , the National heal@@ th@@ care system costs $ 2 billion per year .
through the clear indic@@ ations of the current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of the loss that is caused by smoking , we carry out our national j@@ ur@@ is@@ diction .
BBC should run East@@ er@@ ers , former Chief of Channel 4 tells East@@ er@@ ers .
the former ch@@ air@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson has said to send programs to send programs like East@@ er@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ val@@ en would be the right arm for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee will only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent through other UK @-@ stations .
he sur@@ vey@@ ed the BBC &apos;s critical show that they will be seen public rectangular programs , probably from a smaller audi@@ ences , in hard @-@ contro@@ versi@@ al time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ val@@ en and transmitters such as BB@@ C4 .
after BBC &apos;s general Director , Tony rever@@ b said that the company had to do more in partnership with other organizations that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC &apos;s .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or s@@ ends , which also clearly stated by not sub@@ si@@ oni@@ zed ri@@ val@@ en , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Comm@@ unic@@ ator Committee in the context of its investigation on the future of BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I am medi@@ a- or long @-@ term work for a good idea , you should do his production at least on programs that other do not make or commissioned .
just send the voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to get a wide holder support for their future .
the idea that else would no show that there is a jo@@ ke , it is sm@@ ile , it is of course un@@ sin@@ us@@ ly .
Johnson said : &quot; I see not why exc@@ essi@@ al control programs are f@@ unded , which might be f@@ unded without sub@@ si@@ dies .
the voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ers is another easy , cover is both weight reproduction .
hon@@ est@@ ly I would give other channels to the right arm .
I simply ask me to see how this is publi@@ cl@@ y television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC all .
Johnson , a contrac@@ tors for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC school was led to the h@@ unt for the h@@ unt for people who work there , because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments to the most popular sur@@ ve@@ ys of BBC will give the back what the former ladder by Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ro@@ gart @-@ presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows just like East@@ er@@ ers .
Johnson said that the more public non @-@ legal software programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 , where one would not measure the audience , but they could not come conver@@ se , &quot; now , of course , we have created all these above programs that no@@ body has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no@@ body wanted to see ever .
at broadcast , Johnson became the committee , &quot; I challenge you to find a more exc@@ essi@@ ves system in terms of conditions that can get the best value .
of course , you think all of you think that you will get a great value for £ 150 per year here for people who , for the £ 150 will get a lot of money , if this is true , for it does not cons@@ ume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , invited to make the BBC her riding mission @-@ mission such as to make up and maintain . &quot;
he said , only a few of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio , and in one example , do not accept the public TV transmitters in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of part@@ n@@ ers@@ hips , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in fields like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the comm@@ erci@@ ally trans@@ mit alli@@ ances to make everything online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells using sound waves
the video shows how to change the n@@ emat@@ odes the direction at the moment , in which they will show with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have far@@ ms wor@@ ms with gen@@ et@@ ically modified ner@@ v@@ ous systems that can be controlled by sh@@ out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny em@@ n@@ odes change the direction to the moment , which they serve with sound pulse that are used to high frequencies that they radi@@ ates .
the impul@@ ses are due to the limitation of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that can be gen@@ et@@ ically modified to trans@@ mit the diaphragm channels in the ultr@@ as@@ waves .
another to this topic : researchers read and write she@@ pher@@ als with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new tra@@ verse , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics for ultr@@ as@@ ound , in order to activ@@ ate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , resear@@ cher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Gu@@ ardian a day , a inv@@ asive sampling procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
thread is usually re@@ act at ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did so if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bu@@ b@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , intensi@@ fied the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then put into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ as@@ waves on structures that are called T@@ RP @-@ 4 @-@ es @-@ channels and are found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the dig@@ nation cells .
the sound waves beat the opening of these signals @-@ channels and activ@@ ate the cells that are assigned to a report of Nature Communications .
to create Ultr@@ as@@ ound controlled n@@ odes , the Chal@@ as@@ ani gen@@ et@@ ically gen@@ et@@ ically gen@@ et@@ ically the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ ons T@@ RP @-@ 4 @-@ Ion @-@ channels .
if he cut as@@ ound onto the variable cir@@ cles , the sound waves are reinforced by the mic@@ rons and trans@@ mit into the wor@@ ms where they changed Mot@@ one@@ ous zones .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a break@@ through tool , the scientists enables the ne@@ ur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and cut off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some benefits compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent from a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , the low frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound origin@@ ated and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ therap@@ eutic and a therap@@ eutic Virus it is possible to make human ne@@ ur@@ ons for the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ produc@@ tive cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago , I moved as an independent 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student house , but only in faith on Ber@@ ets and mor@@ al relative vis@@ m , but I now remember the cl@@ amped p@@ ile of those who I susp@@ ected - and to those who are many more e@@ at@@ ants more than others .
the most what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight easy rules .
the entrance in student halls reaches from slightly ner@@ ve up to absolutely terri@@ ble .
it is a cur@@ ly to swe@@ ar : Men tell wh@@ ence you know if you &apos;re not law@@ ful if you &apos;re not law@@ ful Mar@@ m@@ ite nor h@@ ate , because in Ernst , guys , it is only a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha . I am in my room . &quot;
breath@@ ing through .
and help others to do the same - give questions and show interest .
it is direc@@ ting the conversation and helps you to find people like in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your lashes would be in fire , and this fire ext@@ ingu@@ isher .
leave people .
the rooms of people walking often in drinks @-@ Recipes , film night events and municipal distri@@ butions , but they are also the vac@@ anc@@ ies in those people and their under@@ wear .
this will be related : do not remember to start the university with a relationship .
Intro@@ duc@@ es receive a great treatment at the university .
your room should be a ref@@ uge ; but many of student halls create a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ umm@@ el @-@ culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally , and to live friendship .
that can be hell for someone , seeking to recover .
nothing in culture allowed you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will need to go out that our friendship will go away , so that I have to get the energy for the inter@@ action with you . &quot;
do you feel to feel when a dress@@ er of soci@@ ali@@ zing is ex@@ hau@@ sted - and send him an SMS message instead .
puri@@ os to kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
close Friend@@ ship with Baking .
since you start the university entrance on the cli@@ max of Back man@@ ie , is the kno@@ ck to the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less st@@ range than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ies &apos; Welcome to the neighborhood , I don &apos;t sm@@ ile you a few individual questions . &quot;
homemade W@@ eck@@ er@@ chen@@ ette is a good way to close friends .
your pers@@ onal@@ ities feel themselves to teach , and become all the face toward a delicious surprise at the end .
of course it depends on whether you are a permanent bakery .
poor cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat do so you need to drink it when people slip .
food to ste@@ al is a consi@@ stent crime in student halls .
of course , the little ones of chicken is a the@@ ft , but is it take a drop of Mil@@ king for your tea ?
check the with the milk owner .
the od@@ ds are well that they say to operate even if they are at the inside .
if someone recom@@ men@@ ds your stu@@ ff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have enough to move to move there than mine bodies , who added to milk a rins@@ ing agent to spr@@ inkl@@ ing .
she is now in prison .
you ought no noise to make the people out of sleep or working .
it &apos;s not just about to be an ur@@ is@@ diction human being , but that you belong to the true sense of the country that sit in the Gl@@ ash@@ out .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked its neigh@@ bo@@ urs , whether it is something enough , Drum &amp; bass gu@@ ards some qui@@ eter , for it three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a check in the morning .
they re@@ acted there with even list@@ ening music .
finally , at 5 o &apos;clock they had heard her neigh@@ bo@@ urs therefore had two hours to sleep , before they decided to termin@@ ate her own music , and join its three hour testing .
if it would not be romantic if your future wife would return to the same student house ?
it was not de@@ e@@ ti@@ ed that it would not so@@ ver@@ sely pop@@ ulated during your future , if you have to let them go , and they will see every day , and perhaps how they will see all common friends ?
of course , the heart of his own way - but if a name is definitely not your marriage photo @-@ ner@@ ability , try at least to have a little understanding .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has closed its key in its not closed room , is the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ bb@@ ing f@@ one when it seems .
a good st@@ y is fun but it takes only eye sometimes , until he will get to the B@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
share your valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never lose someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
immediately left her door , and place their key into a glass of water , then put them into the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers their owners at the ceiling of no more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , all@@ ergy advice , straight service
the real estate entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is build in the mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian town houses for people who have not much money .
thus approximately for Re@@ fuge@@ es - again as signal : &quot; not only refugees need it , but also the mother and the straight service . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be still favor@@ able today and easily , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are located in the housing market .
the entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner has believed to know how many favor@@ able living space can be created : it builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are penet@@ rates on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass@@ ac@@ ulous accommodation in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for hum@@ ans remain at a large part here .
in view of the refuge@@ e , we also need enough living space in the next decade .
a very channel , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terrac@@ ed house needs to be at least .
it fac@@ ilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when people accommod@@ ates the people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consisting of three units for each of four as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back .
then , the houses can be rebuilt after the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euro , excluding property .
it is very sc@@ ar@@ ably .
construction lasted for six months .
this is adequ@@ ate .
do construction regulations have comp@@ lic@@ ated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : construction right now I moved my project correctly .
it is especially comp@@ lic@@ ated and the dro@@ h@@ ated Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ we@@ ert speci@@ fies and the space @-@ space regulations .
grey .
it is still back@@ ben@@ ds , who can handle in a row at three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities , the place is missing .
and refugees and as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers have no cars .
how do you re@@ act to the town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there was what to create luxury cars for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers .
what is not wrong .
but don &apos;t wor@@ se to the competition about a paid @-@ able d@@ well@@ ings ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : is true : we had a building boom in the last five years , but were built luxury apartments which can be found in one more aff@@ ord .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the straight service alone .
I , like you still favor@@ able today and can build me today .
therefore it is .

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the limit checks were also high@@ ligh@@ ted at our south @-@ border , &quot; said interior designer Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border stay in parallel in parallel .
it is clear that everyone who wants to ask an as@@ yl@@ um application , this is also of course . &quot;
the supply and security of the people in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear also that it needs clear signals , said the Prime Minister .
people must know that we cannot accept mig@@ rat@@ ory curr@@ ents , also not about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia Is Al@@ low@@ ed &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has ref@@ used
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia had emerg@@ ed for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany under circum@@ st@@ ances also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is the interior of the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors may be &quot; absolutely in@@ accept@@ able &quot; , Slovenia will be complete the monitoring of the border - especially for Hungary - more .
the limit with Croatia is an out@@ line of volume control over already heav@@ ily .
like the min@@ isters of the min@@ ef@@ r@@ w , Sloven@@ in that its limits for refugees were not available .
&quot; each EU member must fill his oblig@@ ations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; st@@ ressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government had already tried the first refugees to arrive in the night schedule , in Ost@@ ovo on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID to avoid the registration .
in the near corn fields , the Croatian police was able to attack them .
according to local media , since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police regularly come with new refugees since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it was mainly around Sy@@ ri@@ ans and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross was already in use .
in the coming days there are over 4000 refugees trying to place Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Moreover , buses from the Mac@@ edonia are to be transferred to the Mac@@ edonia that previously mig@@ rants were brought to the Hungarian border to Croatia , the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday so far .
the government in Belgrade be@@ stric@@ tly that it was to dis@@ able people to see certain routes : &quot; neither we can , nor do this , whose name it is .
according to the media reports , in the morning there was a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian town of S@@ ID , in the run of the day would expect further buses .
more than Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the ins@@ ect was the whole night of approximately 500 kilometres di@@ stant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary is in Hungary , so we told us that we will have to come here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany in Germany , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could be already pre @-@ accused of the previous Balk@@ an Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Mac@@ edonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary a little further west @-@ west distance .
Croatia : comprehensive possibilities to control control &quot;
in Croatia , the Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had predic@@ ted that his country for the case of a strong growth of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible dis@@ simulation .
he did not know , but he po@@ inted out that Croatia was as a non @-@ Sch@@ engen event , comprehensive possibilities to cross control control .
we carry out stri@@ ct controls to quali@@ fy for the membership in the volume .
Slovenia has been part of the EU partner since 2007 , since the country has been running a good testim@@ ony , subject to the standard level control lines .
on this page , merge behind the Hungarian Gren@@ ad@@ n remains at about 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they had the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ es H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i bre@@ g remains completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , is still clear .
the Ser@@ b Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to so@@ othing early during a local au@@ spices in H@@ org@@ os : he served the debates about alternative civ@@ ilian country after the Hungarian border now is closed for re@@ former .
it would not have to negoti@@ ate a very high number of refugees .
you could not tell whether they would continue to continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers adv@@ ancing mig@@ rants - dangerous goods - alternative
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distri@@ bute the refugees to distri@@ bute the refugees in an alternative route through Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the cross @-@ area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia group , neither very cle@@ ared min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday morning , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance in the border region was sent .

Fed@@ Ex Score mixed , Finance prosp@@ ects for 2016 substanti@@ ally
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ efer gen@@ es out@@ lined its profit for a whole year due to the we@@ ak@@ est demand for freight service and higher cost in his soil .
the company also said that it plans to present approximately 55@@ .000 seas@@ onal workers for the holiday .
at that time in the past year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company had to set up 50,000 of the season for the holiday season .
the share fell by over 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market sector 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. released a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10,90 $ in the financial year which ends in May , 20 cents f@@ ewer than in previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts anticip@@ ated a survey from Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes from the price increases , on average 4.9 percent , and on the 4th of January , and in sp@@ ite of higher sur@@ plus stands for bod@@ y@@ transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it was non@@ eth@@ eless , the result compared to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher income , and due to growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &apos;s &quot; solid income brings you to maintain the we@@ aker and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for the holiday @-@ employment have announced a day later than the Ri@@ val UPS , the plant is planning from 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ ,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , this ended on August 31 , ended Fed@@ Ex 692 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to € 2,@@ 42 per share , just under the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve from C@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of those nations asked to anal@@ ysts $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has achieved a decline in international priority over the last years to sign up the turnover in his unit Express delivery to the stag@@ nation .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex zone .
in the last quarter , sales from ground waste by 29 percent , but the operating result was in bas@@ ically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit generated higher income due to higher prices , while the result came to a higher profit cost in the shipping business .
in the pre@@ co @-@ market , approximately one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares will be 3,85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11th June .

Dro@@ h@@ end about them at an end of a set , two @-@ story sitting room is a picture of the United States .
the map is a re@@ membr@@ ance that the F@@ ed ch@@ air@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colle@@ ague took the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from the congress : Maxim@@ ising the U.S. occupation and prices stable here .
but since the great rec@@ ession have recognis@@ ed the F@@ ed Guide that it is an un@@ defe@@ ated third party : financial stability .
and this third mand@@ ate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to be it &apos;s fo@@ aming . it is ready to be announced if the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the out@@ p@@ est interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy showing a solid growth , the latest tur@@ bul@@ ences could make the most recent tur@@ bul@@ ences , these people could be reinforced with the increase of interest for sub@@ sid@@ ers - and be it just by one @-@ quarter percentage .
&quot; ob@@ viously , the labor market and the inflation in the first line will ob@@ serve what they ob@@ serve , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ econom@@ in at the bro@@ ker@@ age @-@ firm Sti@@ ens &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were not looking for a pre@@ paid , the interest rate was not to increase , is the increased Un@@ certain@@ ty around the global market will continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us that the F@@ ed is un@@ in@@ sured even to the financial markets .
approximately half of the econom@@ ists who were asked recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have asked a interest in this week .
however , the financial markets also a@@ wait a decrease of F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ cators , which shows just a 30 % chance to increase in an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased , it is that the strateg@@ ies leave the impact w@@ re@@ ck by increasing so that another increase is di@@ stant from .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value at 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % rose to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 points .
the action was trig@@ ger@@ ed by expectations that F@@ ed policy took up the pro@@ position in this week , John Lons@@ ki , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ ome at Moody &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at this time , &quot; he said .
if it does it , &quot; would have to go well in their declaration , to so@@ othing the financial markets that they haven &apos;t been in pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts ar@@ gu@@ ed that the interest in the capital markets would be so@@ othing because the unc@@ ertain@@ ty will elim@@ inate when the F@@ ed is being elim@@ inate .
even before a month on a good way to increase the pro@@ position of 0.25 percentage points to this month , the first step in a s@@ onic inf@@ int@@ ment of the Mon@@ etary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spr@@ ing@@ time and during the early summer , despite the compl@@ aints by Liber@@ als that more economical progress would be required to raise the movement .
although the creation of work places in August , the improvement of the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years , and close to the level , which sees the F@@ ed as a full .
w@@ age increasing numbers have shown a recovery .
and although the inflation has ste@@ ad@@ ily under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives told that the main reason would be the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
the economy can see higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian She@@ ph@@ erd@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ ome at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ econom@@ ics .
but the financial markets around the world began together in the end of the month after China had its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average shopping basket fell by more than 16 % among its highest levels when invest@@ ors prove that a conf@@ id@@ ation of the Chinese economy would be the global growth of growth .
the market last relaxing in this month , with the D@@ ow is now 10 % below the high season .
for the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives aff@@ ect the market tur@@ bul@@ ences the complex lim@@ ati@@ zation , when you increase the interest .
&quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the we@@ ak@@ ness of the Chinese economy would not occurred in the last few weeks , she said , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research F@@ ellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and an former staff of the US l@@ ender .
now , he tells us that she should wait at least one month to get the effects of better in the handle .
&quot; there are a lot of unc@@ ertain@@ ty which will be the effects on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that was fil@@ med in China &quot; said O@@ liner .
global economy is one of the main imp@@ air@@ force of the F@@ ed , hence they should not be related to their decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect the F@@ ed F@@ ed authorities have become a monetary authorities in the world .
the influence of Central Bank has enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly in recent years .
the blo@@ oming note of the then , Ben S. Bern@@ hardt in 2013 showed that F@@ ed their mon@@ et@@ arian expansion &quot; could be resol@@ ved around the globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies are incre@@ as@@ ingly w@@ anting to join the F@@ ed representative , but also with other central banks and experts , to get a better understanding of the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary carb@@ ine , founder of the global strategy of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , notice this month , &quot; the F@@ ed has linked into a history of spann@@ ing operations on financial markets , which are not associated with the economic fundam@@ ental data . &quot;
pain@@ tw@@ ard , permanent member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de @-@ ranked as an example of interest and dec@@ isions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its head@@ quarter to 2.5 percentage points in three sessions , despite a limited recognition effect on the growth in the USA .
a year later , the F@@ ed @-@ Re@@ present@@ atives made these cuts .
F@@ ed should set the aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the market launch in 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est festival of England .
the latest tur@@ bul@@ ences are not coming near this level , he said .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ned in front of housing
situation on the German housing market is st@@ ressed .
and again more refugees are looking for an paid lead .
printing on the housing market is growing .
social kit is in front of a challenge .
the Distri@@ but@@ ors on the German housing market have longest e@@ vid@@ enced .
with the in@@ coming refugees and un@@ employed out of the EU there are more people on a market , which is already over@@ loaded in many cities .
they comp@@ eting with conf@@ ess citizens to create the last paid apartments .
in order to cover demand for paid @-@ paid apartments , to 2020 each year , 400,000 new units are built .
in this result , a study was commissioned by the prohib@@ ition of the &quot; Social residential building . &quot;
for comparison : this year , some 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
a total of 140@@ .000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of its stay , there are no longer oblig@@ ation to live as as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in an initial network .
many sto@@ cked on the housing market and lined up into the long sl@@ aves in front of the rental apartments .
however , less than half of all as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers came to rent in the last year , less than half of all as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers .
however , the negative trend of the housing is not only possible in increasing refugees .
the study also makes significant tests in the building foreign policy of the last years .
Germany : a budget defic@@ it before , which is bigger one year from year to year .
at present , some 770@@ .000 units sold in metro@@ polit@@ an areas compl@@ ained by Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many occup@@ ations are therefore placed in large cities in major cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tar@@ ily in@@ vol@@ unt@@ ary longer in the &quot; Hotel M@@ ama in front of the river Market .
in the big cities , the number of square meter per capita declined continuously in the last years .
to solve this problem the alli@@ ance &quot; Social residential building &quot; opens up a new start .
on the occasion of the social housing , new min@@ ent construction shall be back up .
thus one could be zi@@ pped down on the real property tax and land@@ fill the properties of subsidi@@ zed apartments .
in addition , according to the Alliance @-@ able control software are required .
the funding program for refuge@@ e has been well attended by the state bank of Kf@@ W in cities and municip@@ alities .
a good week after the start was the Monday evening with 184 million euros already more than half of the available amounts to some 300 million euros .
now the project could even be exposed .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia Cor@@ ridor cor@@ ridor
according to Hungary there is not a continuous more , since then , more res@@ orts along the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces to give the trip through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ dles .
but it is dangerous for non@@ eth@@ eless .
Croatia wants to communic@@ ate with the neigh@@ bo@@ uring Slovenia for the setting of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke about the Sloven@@ ian interior Minister in Spanish , and when it is necessary to organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU Land Croatia is still not a Sch@@ engen country .
after the shooting of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia is broken down from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come on the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television set in RTL .
Hungary had its limit for refugees in the day before the day of refugees .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , increasing the as@@ yl@@ um procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees in Croatia .
the Croatian Prime Minister Z@@ oran Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; you can travel , and we are prepar@@ ing for us in this way . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who live and something like .
however , they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
on the morning , the Croatian police had att@@ acked the first refugees to the EU neigh@@ bor in Croatia .
the most innovative media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both with the bus as well as a Tax@@ es in the Serbian border of S@@ ID .
immediately after her arrival they had att@@ empt@@ ed to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian Serbian border , the refugees were not on the Gren@@ ad@@ une .
for that the cut @-@ blade other d@@ ang@@ ers : there are still sharp min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990@@ s .
Min@@ ef@@ ati@@ er is supposed to create a secure passage .
after Hungary there are hardly more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police cul@@ min@@ ated 366 lives .
shortly before Tor@@ que on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws exam@@ ines the over@@ come and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns ( Criminal Law ) .
in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the def@@ endant was thre@@ at@@ ening to five years and the dep@@ ort@@ ation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration of the immig@@ ration to reach a total of 94 as@@ yl@@ um applications , of which almost all - 93 - most in the most important transition effects .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there was about 40 refugees too .
but in practice , no@@ body has no longer a view of as@@ yl@@ um in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe back@@ slide . &quot;
the rej@@ ected as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers are to be up@@ going down .
just a few hundred refugees were gathered before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began workers to come up .
they raised the effort , having left several thousands of people over the road@@ side in the last weeks .
the pl@@ ywood were built and rebuilt from the location in the border .
for the goal of this circum@@ fer@@ ries , no@@ body interested in the target .
in Austria , Austria and Hungary after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border line .
around 20,000 mig@@ rants ret@@ ained the state of government still in the country .
around 1400 people wait for further trips to Germany in Salzburg .
the train arrived from there to Germany was stopped at the morning of the German authorities in the morning .
sm@@ ass@@ ing met a regular groups of refugees too stro@@ ll on foot .
Mayor of the border &quot; over the border
&quot; we were involved in the bridge on Sunday with the Au@@ stri@@ pe , when suddenly ten people were travelling with travel on the entrance of the Zel@@ ts , &quot; such as W@@ ern@@ st@@ one may@@ or Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to Passau with train to Passau .
because Germany was sur@@ pris@@ ingly on Sunday but because of the refuge@@ e camp with Austria , it was for them in W@@ ern@@ stein Schl@@ uss , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately completed his help and ordered the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border in Passau .
previously , we have the un@@ expected score only once to@@ asted , with so@@ ak and drink .
we have said to Passau , we will bring them back to Passau .
&quot; that was of course of course , &quot; so Stad@@ ler was in the O@@ ÖN conversation .
they were very d@@ ank@@ ful .
a man sent out there to be a gener@@ ous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it was very cour@@ age to us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .

the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neigh@@ bo@@ urs on Sunday healthy , tags in a branch , organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Vik@@ tor Or@@ b@@ án is now send out more gyp@@ si@@ es to us , is a logical result of a appar@@ ent polit@@ ics :
instead of storage R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures to help human wisdom , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor were highly officially den@@ ied and publi@@ cl@@ y in the position of the Hungarian Government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis in the National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ trag@@ ic of this policy are not only those Au@@ stri@@ ans who are con@@ fron@@ ted in the border areas with ch@@ a@@ otic conditions .
you must remember the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing places that &quot; gel@@ m@@ ised Land &quot; will invite you to welcome and welcome nothing but nothing than another refuge@@ e camp .
there will be a major challenge , given in view of the an@@ ying refuge@@ e flows and the appro@@ aching winter , with us w@@ ished basic conditions for protective clothing .
and it will be even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .

but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of Trag@@ ik : you wish to return to the home country in the Bavarian State at the Pal@@ at@@ inate .
he did not res@@ ist Tr@@ ump because he was once without homologation , &quot; the Director of the Institute of Par@@ isi@@ an history and folk art , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump be the grand@@ son of an &quot; il@@ legal interpretation . &quot;
this is contrast to the majority of the desc@@ endants of the desc@@ endants in contrast to the occas@@ ions .
in addition to the emig@@ rants dro@@ wn@@ ed over the immig@@ rants in the US and the construction of a cut r@@ amp@@ er to prevent il@@ legal immig@@ rants .
&quot; so as the pol@@ y , it is not so s@@ ymp@@ ath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ related ver@@ sely ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a n@@ ée Tr@@ ump , who was O@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the wine retired from reti@@ rement is more dist@@ ill@@ ary , &quot; it is always so exciting . &quot;
beli@@ eves that Tr@@ ump comes from it ?
&quot; I do not imag@@ ine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never curved around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the p@@ ensi@@ on@@ ator in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ers come to a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz in a visit for the church organ , which was generally well t@@ ended .
&quot; I do not imag@@ ine a Donald &quot; or tell me , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old man says .
it &apos;s worth it better if he don &apos;t know the choice , because it has such radi@@ cal views , I don &apos;t know if the gut is good . &quot;
if those who had the days of his grand@@ father in the U.S. , that would have been such that he would never be doing there . &quot;
&quot; there is more interesting topics as it , &quot; says Win@@ em@@ to@@ chter Sarah Bu@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; says it .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the Presid@@ ency of Tr@@ ump . &quot;

mystery revealed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are probably un@@ w@@ iss@@ ally , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor of Wood , was revealed in largest hidden country .
and there will not be the three remaining girls , certainly not to give away the one who received the last one .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows at the day , before three two are , once checked , you may possibly acc@@ ident@@ ally given a hint to be the winner .
Sam Wood continuously keeps the lips until the finale at Thursday
all three women have sett@@ led in the yr@@ ite mode , why the perfect man is called and called his sense of hum@@ or , Ehr@@ int@@ ly , family values and positive adjust@@ ments than the reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is made , &quot; If not you , who should be Wo@@ ods Last Rose ? &quot; , could be their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki did both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in wood for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood joined the first day in a simple relationship .
&quot; from the moment , when I went into the house ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energi@@ es , I notic@@ ed that they were quite compatible , and I have thought that in the entire course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah wrote with his feet in the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , added Mark@@ os@@ ki is added .
I have seen it together and they have the right chem@@ istry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believe that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from their view , M@@ ack@@ ay told the visit to the visit of the one week that Wood &quot; had its &quot; be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I saw him with my friends and the family , I was clear that this ob@@ viously did not only be a game - I am now ready for him , &quot; said it . &quot;
and when she was asked to select who Wood , if not they , she was s@@ lim@@ entary .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equ@@ ally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA , and there were many other teams that re@@ mem@@ bered his impressive training day at the end of last year .

some trainer had Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game than he lost to the rest , as he lost to the top of the first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .

instead of its ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the teams through the mill , he encour@@ age them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strength@@ ens Hay@@ ne also open@@ ly presented in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also had been encour@@ aged by Special @-@ ams co @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y to do his promise to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ at , who was restored in the first quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to have Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian free@@ zers for his N@@ FL @-@ debut ho@@ pes for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left after the F@@ um@@ ble , the field and told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , he could have no bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that is coming to take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne loved the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a Pass at in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .

for easily over@@ weight di@@ abet@@ ics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say that easily over@@ weight people with diabetes by weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show anything , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss Sur@@ gery , which wrote a leading article on JAM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss of operations or ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use different methods to ver@@ tically the size of magic .
they reduce h@@ unger and limit their own ability to increase food .
over the years , ob@@ es@@ ity operations are proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were performed with people who are ob@@ ese @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BMI of 30 are considered as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI weight : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which has been collected in one study and compare two types of ob@@ es@@ ity surgery - mag@@ enta treatment - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were over@@ weight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ went surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI of those who were not surgical induc@@ ed diabetes treatments received approximately at 29 .
one of those who is subj@@ ected to surgical procedure , in 36 % of diabetes disease totally and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , the type of diabetes was fully only slightly lower at one percent and in just about two percent .
in addition , the results were carried out at check@@ ing blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; LD@@ L ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; was generally better in the &apos; surgical medical group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers monitoring the patient also super@@ vision of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which refl@@ ects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
Hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c was considered best under 7 per cent , write the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it refl@@ ects in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the ster@@ ity in five years , so the resear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ SU and his colleagues .
the research team also provides advertisement Average results in the two types of Sur@@ gery .
in fifth year , the by@@ pass surgery had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher resi@@ ded ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ come of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survi@@ vor@@ s of the surgery after five years , there are crit@@ ics from a study greater people in Sweden , says the surgery says , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in ob@@ ese people who und@@ ergo an ob@@ es@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tran@@ sc@@ ar@@ ising the conventional methods .
although the new study had no advantage for survival mean in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it is based on a BMI of 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; that is the critical point of this study , because it says that this surgery is found in this lower BMI @-@ group lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or a ney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone put that people and their doctors begin to take weight , when the patient en@@ rolled up a BMI between 27 and 30 hours .
&quot; I think we have to wait for long until we bring people to take this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I think that they have collected these gen@@ etic amend@@ ments to have caused her body with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , is a turning really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone should come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria efforts to con@@ science the crisis lo@@ bb@@ ons , he st@@ ressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; in order to take several thousand refugees , but in the mean@@ time you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , as a real peace and true development , mainly due to education , for this Muslim countries . &quot;
ulti@@ mat@@ ely , we must remember , as the k@@ illing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce use by violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never dissol@@ ved these problems , he added .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and comm@@ ented George Bus@@ hes D@@ hs after the ter@@ ro@@ rist attacks of September 11 and sett@@ led that the viol@@ ent response of the U.S. a chain of un@@ controlled events moved .
after September 11 , I pressed my side in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem in violence .

four@@ fold increase by hand san@@ iti@@ zer through children in the past 4 years
full control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , su@@ pers@@ ge drinking water san@@ iti@@ zer , so the Georgia PO@@ IS@@ ON Center .
according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia PO@@ IS@@ ON Center , reported cases of operations by hand @-@ inf@@ ecti@@ ous agents for children under 12 years of age , Ven@@ om checks altogether , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are incre@@ as@@ ingly often in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going into account , said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ infection , while some es do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation at the social media .
video on YouTube Show how y@@ outh@@ s disinf@@ ect@@ ant only drink for a cheap exc@@ it@@ ement .
ju@@ ven@@ ile have been supp@@ os@@ edly liquid disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft drink water , to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be cultiv@@ ated from attractive speci@@ ali@@ zers of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child remember that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , vineyards and orange du@@ ft which are very promising for children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer are somew@@ here between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very small d@@ oves can lead to the alcohol to be bre@@ d in too small children .
&quot; it is highly concentr@@ ated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ fts in the hospital at the University of Kan@@ sas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not let it be g@@ ently stir@@ red , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come , then it &apos;s a quick way to cons@@ ume much alcohol .
N@@ h@@ ai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a se@@ em @-@ year girl , who recently had four tur@@ tle from after strawberry , dis@@ infection was taken into the school , was brought into a emerg@@ ing acceptance .
your blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is sunk by an adult oblig@@ atory , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , who received her at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ h@@ ai@@ jah appe@@ als her words , and did not stand in the position as they were in the not@@ ew@@ ell .
doctors super@@ vised it over night in a separate child@@ hood house on a symbol of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girls had fallen by the alcohol and was over@@ head the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sur@@ prising , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ h@@ ai@@ ah@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could be f@@ atal for my child .
LO@@ PE@@ Z has the parents and teachers , alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant women use and hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ant were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women were killed in On@@ t@@ ario women after the sl@@ ain of hand san@@ iti@@ ous inf@@ ecti@@ veness , which contained an tox@@ ic substances .
staff of health authorities are related to meth@@ anol contained the product meth@@ anol , a dead@@ ly solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ alcohol , which was not@@ able as active ingre@@ dient .

the former ranking players and former national players of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch fans are lost to Cel@@ tic . there are no title ri@@ val@@ ance with the leaderboard .
de Bo@@ er , currently a amb@@ ass@@ ador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland won &apos;t show the highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the leaderboard are not there .
people don &apos;t speak just over the return of the leaderboard .
they speak about the old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of voltage in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onny D@@ eil@@ a has to fight that Cel@@ tic fight is to fight things , but things return to things .
following the defe@@ at of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent emerg@@ ing from the Champions League , the defe@@ at with 10 @-@ man of Aberdeen , who stand out with five points it is clear to the top of the table .
D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already before poor times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come back as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very an@@ gr@@ y or s@@ ad via what happens .
we feel that - but we must go on .
we really need to really get the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
now , together is so important .

why I will be witness of a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late inter@@ vention , I will con@@ sid@@ ence how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it is not going to sit in a view@@ ers gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Gl@@ ory vic@@ ted through the po@@ ison @-@ injection .
he asked me , one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation only took place in January about his best friend and although I was sho@@ cked , I agre@@ e with .
when the day appro@@ aching , I started to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I agre@@ e because I thought about it would have a good opportunity to tell the entire story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique persp@@ ective .
it is true that journalists they are able to see places in the United States , and since often more applications are available , there will be a ma@@ kab@@ oot lot@@ tery to deci@@ de , who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected to ob@@ serve it em@@ oti@@ onal .
I can not do this .
I will sit in addition to Richard Gl@@ ory @-@ comm@@ enc@@ ils , with whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of months with telephone and a two @-@ hour visit .
I like guy .
we often have much , if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I may not be a witness to a journ@@ alist , so it will not be allowed to sign me , a notebook and a pin to draw , what I see .
I must try to remember all the details .
a journ@@ alist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma did not read me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of a family , how he wants to get it , and you can access it .
I test@@ ify me with you .
she sp@@ ati@@ al that it could form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but they knew that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ory had problem with some of these things I wrote and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t say to me what I have to write ; and I would not do it even when he would do it .
I told him that he can easily remove the witnesses from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to present an international rep@@ orter of present to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relation of the motion will help to death against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is located next to me .
if you want more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ c@@ asts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back on all details .
I cannot tell security that Richard Gl@@ ory p is not guilty .
his acts according to the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to him a f@@ emin@@ ist .
but I believe that a strong prob@@ ability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his device is wrong .
and from this persp@@ ective I will surely die .
I cannot keep it , really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other questions on which you can .
what you get from me , what is it means to see a man &apos;s un@@ necessary death .

an att@@ empt of man of Per@@ th , to def@@ end the police was un@@ successful , but only few meters from a police station , who tried to speak , &quot; it g@@ ently to speak , &quot; to the bank of the river . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning Vale began on Tuesday at a hom@@ ew@@ heel accident at Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the dam@@ nation , tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he was not too far .
&quot; he stood in water , and said &apos; I come out , come and Ho@@ l me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .

in 2006 , co@@ usin went into the Gr@@ aben to escape a alcohol @-@ control and tried to sw@@ im over the Swan River .

Peter sug@@ ge@@ sts that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his pe@@ eling and thre@@ at@@ ened to finish the race immediately .
he directed to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integration of Racing Victoria and claimed that they held a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday , performed .
Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for the race , and himself is under difficult conditions , when it went to expl@@ ain the positive Cobalt @-@ sw@@ abs at Li@@ dar@@ a while he can not expl@@ ain .
he did not look back on 18 months because of the sk@@ elet@@ age war , he did not want to rise up as too high in grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had before nothing to say nothing to say , and I have kept it to eat , but sometimes they are so fru@@ stated that all at once arose , was Moody .
they know that it was far .
sometimes it is re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I have said .
I will go home even for home and well .
I would like to go to the top , and I want to think that my owner will try my best for them .
if you don &apos;t think , I do not do it , then I should not work anymore .
I have to put what I do with my license .
earlier in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , the Bom@@ b had tried that the integration department had tried to cut out his stable .
&quot; in the eigh@@ teen months , Terr@@ y B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - I will be asked if I will be asked for information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; he delivered them to Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they believe it mani@@ fest@@ ed that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if the case is , they should be decided to leave their nose because they have sin@@ king myself at trying to leave me .
Robert Rou@@ h@@ ston , former ch@@ airman of the RV@@ L , David Mo@@ o@@ die , Vice President of the RV@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were still aware of which it is still today .
should I bring it to the view that it is pers@@ onally ?
have the RV@@ L ac@@ tures and makes perhaps people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going to come in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out , that I am it .
perhaps you need to take me my license and I have no dou@@ bt that I say what I say that they are now thinking about it .
but I now arrived at the point that the no matter is , and that makes me s@@ ad .
this makes me a s@@ ad .
I will push the pressure to them and ex@@ es them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ ity levels of train@@ ers have set up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late Sc@@ rat@@ ching resulted in that he said that he had &quot; his license over the table . &quot;

I have to take over the full responsibility . &quot;
one of my members und@@ erl@@ ying mu@@ d to the leg on the stomach .
it could be even more night .
it could be yesterday &apos;s all day , what also was so .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moody could be opened with a three @-@ month discount for the treatment with a pack of the race day . a study of this matter was opened .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who make these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all will see that we had rules , but here is too far away , said today .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y created the Tac@@ kling Silver with its player as &quot; Agenda Item &apos; of two Premier League as favorite N@@ RL .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ STER@@ S coach Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson said that the ar@@ bit@@ er@@ ites will open the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring@@ tones &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Br@@ isb@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a missing comment at the Storm Team , after his team got the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ aard on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; Muster@@ le@@ land &quot; of the Rugby League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land wasn &apos;t too good . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that she can only be concentr@@ ated with the Tac@@ Spar@@ kling Team on their &quot; Contact . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added sug@@ ge@@ sts that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach in his team did not agre@@ e because it was sc@@ atter@@ ed by the Storm Team .
&quot; that is imm@@ ers@@ ed again - I did not heard that Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson at the open meet again , when they had defe@@ ated 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed in all year nothing to our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es , and it worked for us the tr@@ end@@ use .
Tr@@ ent has now been there for three years , and he has ob@@ vious a great team since three years . he is therefore not used to lose it , so it was a bit for him .
it is already a kom@@ isch , how to re@@ do@@ ve this time again .
Bell@@ am@@ y lived Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and re@@ membr@@ ance its ment@@ ality that Benn@@ etts St George ill@@ awar@@ ra cr@@ ises the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long &quot; football &quot; .
Wayne made by exciting soccer .
he took his play at Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was a long @-@ residence team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that play and that we can see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball@@ game that you would like to play this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now , he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anth@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I agre@@ e with confidence , because they say these things they are concern@@ ed against us to play against us .
six weeks ago they have thought about us , when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also proved to be the game Storm against RO@@ O@@ STER@@ S a higher result than the Game of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the Game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I did not have it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more att@@ emp@@ ts in our game , but is that a exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and do not get any points ?
for me there are the play@@ sch@@ emati@@ cs .
when they mention it , it means that we will meet again in one phase .
the Storm Team has free to receive this weekend , since it won the right to welcome either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next to next service tomorrow .

Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of five men that were arrested last month after the military police arrested 100 kg of the h@@ unter against V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the late afternoon and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
in sp@@ ite of a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong pun@@ ishment for the trial , a commercial amount of Kok@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , there was no evidence that he tried to poss@@ ess the entire amount and would have been the café from a har@@ m@@ less reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court , Peter Fl@@ ag@@ an was con@@ vic@@ tori@@ ous about the flood of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations to Serbia .
he often said to Serbia , &quot; he declared to the court on Wednesday .
at the case , he took the police over his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs Mutter and st@@ ep@@ father had a security deposit of 200.000 dollars as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the E@@ id@@ es@@ equ@@ als ex@@ plan@@ ations of the two persons , it is clear that the number of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said jud@@ ges flanges .
but this alone is not enough to hold him , not to be released , war@@ ned .
Mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on damage deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian pas@@ sports , and it holds a daily basis from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 on a daily basis .

the Federal Constitutional Court launched the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
the person concern@@ ed can be conf@@ ident that if they wanted to have a few days in the tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
this was a ex @-@ har@@ m@@ ling with his constitu@@ tional compl@@ aint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of ground floor ; the toilet was sp@@ ati@@ al not separated .
after that the man had been re@@ located on the free foot again , the man who had been moved to a bigger one in the way of his man@@ or .
his ministry of responsibility because of the dis@@ cre@@ dit@@ ch conditions against the Land of Berlin .
but the constitu@@ tional court , the Court of App@@ eal in Berlin was transferred and proved the case to the serious g@@ az@@ ingly .
you see the human dig@@ n@@ ity of the man .
case report deci@@ des on the amount of compensation
even when from ju@@ rist@@ ic reasons there are only a few days of dis@@ assembly for the compensation , be a compensation regarding the compensation , it was called .

Angela Merkel and the refugees : &quot; we are created the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is decided to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Justice in this year according to Germany , according to the testim@@ ony of Vice Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) is in addition to welcome a million refugees .
discussions between German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say back and again , We can create , and we create the &quot; . &quot;
that goes back to Germany , the following overview has come .
after different forecasts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the federal ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ le @-@ Institut ) apartments annually , and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as so far built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dram@@ ati@@ cally , the lack of living space , but especially at paid expenses : every year , 60000 to 800@@ 00 serving apartments are out of a rent location , and in order to apply these very reas@@ onable apartments .
the Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from € 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is the view from the persp@@ ective of the Pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 social @-@ room@@ ed annually and would need to inv@@ est a support of 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Minister mini@@ ster@@ ing in this purpose , scientists have to give more control advantages for investment in the residential building .
according to estimates of the Institute of Labour market and professional research , making long @-@ term 55 percent of the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ation in Germany may be employed .
however , the refugees were not syst@@ emati@@ cally asked in Germany after their qualification to help them to help them , do Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ ist for integration and education in Bert@@ el@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but it is dec@@ is@@ ive for the integration of refugees too , whether they are working in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , but for the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation , but also for the self @-@ value experience of the immig@@ rants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Th@@ ei@@ hardt .
in Germany , in Germany , she has given a political turn@@ around : from the working day for refugees to recognition .
while it was used to apply for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was also reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residents apply for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers .
in society - due to lack of ex@@ hau@@ l . due to lack of ex@@ hau@@ l - lack of persp@@ ectives indicated that refugees should be faster than access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
at so far , there has no effect on general and professional language c@@ urs@@ en .
investig@@ ations suggest that jobs are most often used by personal contacts .
the construction of network drives is therefore to view of Th@@ ott@@ hardt to the Königs@@ weg .
the Berlin &apos;s office administration has notic@@ ed that only a few @-@ fle@@ eing their children to the k@@ itt@@ as , it is estimated that ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ card@@ ed parents , it is only once more important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Cos@@ chem@@ bar , Speaker for Youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ats@@ verwaltung .
in order to con@@ vince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of the board in different languages .
if needed , demand for refugees significantly increase the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would increase its capacity to education , making more technical colle@@ ges .
all students are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully e@@ duc@@ ated teachers , but as in Berlin , also from teachers , who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of evidence , Be@@ ate St@@ ages of the Berlin School Administration .
the German student estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees were stud@@ ying in Germany .
in principle , there is no state of as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers or pati@@ ently the study - the only exception was to be Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) , but has now ab@@ and@@ oned its position .
study of studies could be easier to fac@@ ilit@@ ated the church at the university .
for refugees with a resident or Dul@@ ce do not get services after the as@@ yl@@ um Act , when they begin a study .
the latter did not contain any b@@ af@@ ar , since they did not drop under the circle of actual @-@ up persons .
Th@@ ang@@ ered refugees had to have lived in Germany over four years to be eligible for instance , from 1 January 2016 , this spect@@ ator is short@@ ened to 15 months .
nevertheless , these sub@@ sid@@ ers must be closed , after Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ &apos;s State Secretary for science , and the German student union .
the students should have immediately got B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a major role , because many refugees are Mus@@ li@@ ms , and for many is the religion of important part of their identity .
by Islam , the state should have to become the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches and churches to develop into a new state @-@ religi@@ ons .
the foundation of a Islamic State Association who take care of the Neu@@ ros@@ es in profession@@ ally in order to take care of a Islamic State .
the rights also include oblig@@ ations .
so , the representatives of Islam applied to clear contact persons to some and ready to collab@@ or@@ ate with the state in many fields and have washed his controls .
it also belongs to the read@@ iness to prepare for religious f@@ emin@@ ism .
the Ch@@ air@@ woman of the Mus@@ li@@ ms of Mus@@ li@@ ms , A@@ im@@ an Mac@@ ye@@ k , passed on Thursday the Sor@@ ge , Rel@@ igious Conf@@ lic@@ t could be registered according to Germany .
those who would have wanted to have such conflic@@ ts in Germany , &quot; have immediately made their right to we@@ eping , in Germany , he said , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio .
he suggested to transl@@ ate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be now much more than today a theme of all the company today .
in order to change the majority society , the dis@@ mant@@ ling of dis@@ cri@@ mination and v@@ ass@@ ism is exerc@@ ising .
indeed , in Germany - as a result of European dec@@ isions - have been a compensation committee for an anti @-@ dis@@ cri@@ mination law .
but it is very slow that the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities , the r@@ ass@@ ist motive was syst@@ emati@@ cally rec@@ ated .
the same ch@@ ances for all : what mig@@ rant workers and those interested groups usually would require long and weig@@ hed in the next few years , when the country are peaceful and his new citi@@ zen and citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany , Germany , who have been medi@@ cally reduce the medi@@ ated refugees in medi@@ cally , me@@ ant medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; what MAN@@ - Power and Capacities affects the &quot; , he said the day of the day . &quot;

and long @-@ term , it is highly frag@@ ile , so many people with the limited performance catalogue out@@ comes to the as@@ yl@@ um Act .
otherwise the physi@@ ci@@ ans make all language bar@@ riers are to do .

not only in clin@@ ics , also in doctor &apos;s medical cells , is required to be charged .
in many refugees many refugees too many refugees too many medical devices are in emergency situ@@ ations .
and with another diagnostic view .
amongst the refuge@@ e camps , there are considerably more in@@ treated dis@@ abilities , and with the adol@@ esc@@ ents , and with HIV @-@ re@@ conn@@ aissance .

the Syr@@ p had a highly advanced educational system , some refugees be even doctors .
however , in order to pract@@ ising the qualification , they must sub@@ mit their qualification and lab@@ our@@ ing tests .

FC Arsenal Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that Team shall stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere !
w@@ enger st@@ ressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September be and if his re@@ hab@@ il@@ itation is plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back on Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scen@@ ario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss about the next four games for England and in view of its history , its invol@@ vement in the next summer of the European Championship is safe .
the great sh@@ ame in this recent problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly completed the last season after a separate child did , and then returned to its old pigs during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of inj@@ ury un@@ thre@@ at@@ ened the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that is not well served .
this is no bigger matter .
this was just a accident .
it didn &apos;t stand in connection with his daughters or with the inj@@ uries , which he had before .
this may be true of pure @-@ medical view , but as W@@ enger also recognis@@ ed , there is the associated danger of other inj@@ uries , wh@@ en@@ ever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it develops also a unique pattern .
the examination of Premier In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ as@@ pi@@ elen in the last five game times .
the larger image for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 . they were able to sign most inj@@ uries .
W@@ enger accepted the potential of a fam@@ ine circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believe that a improvement in the inj@@ ury news during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from a viol@@ ation , a period of time , in which you may streng@@ then your body with streng@@ ths and mar@@ ti@@ al force , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young not enough to over@@ come the over@@ come .
I hope to meet his body , I &apos;m conf@@ ident that he will do it and he will run a career of the species that he ear@@ ns .
Arsenal will begin his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against T@@ ott@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ sp@@ ur on the next Wednesday , and W@@ enger had a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not regul@@ ated to Croatia , meaning that Mathi@@ eu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta will begin to start .
W@@ enger also may start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o MON@@ RE@@ AL and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I tried to keep the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the players that need it , a small break break , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although Arsenal had been e@@ vid@@ ent to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most of the most not@@ able table effect in Europe .

the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion of Arsenal had drawn the doc@@ trine from last season with the Champions League Chap@@ ulation against Monaco and remains in the di@@ stant hope of its first Euro@@ pap@@ ok@@ al Triumph in his management .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ une , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never made for Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other side , I &apos;m too long enough in the business to be a realistic way .

Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration : the com@@ edy show that received us serious lessons from male voice messages
the abs@@ ence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is ob@@ viously , especially in regard to the needs of men , have become even des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as su@@ icide in young men , on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important death cause for men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains common in men than in women .

friendship : the heart of the heart in the fight to master the challenge .
a current study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students discovered by de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms that , when the cor@@ ing had sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy m@@ ood , &quot; its ch@@ ances of enjo@@ yment .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental and friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have only once more friends , to work a friendship .
in the age of social media , communication , foc@@ using on substance , foc@@ using on substance is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have need the need , strong , life @-@ life and successfully appear to dou@@ bles , even if in reality the isolation is dom@@ inated .
this super@@ ficial success is domin@@ ant by the dom@@ inated , what psych@@ olog@@ ists extract values , money , image , social status , all at the cost of in@@ tr@@ end@@ ous values - our internal se@@ ar@@ ches for personal development and friendship , which sur@@ ve@@ ys to our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual health .
and as a video game invent@@ or and Milli@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can &apos;t really buy .
the nice thing with friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by its work , but by his person@@ ality caused by Inter@@ action as friend .

Tue to Maria meets PSG to help to z@@ erm@@ al@@ men
angel Di Maria celebrates Bl@@ aise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani with his hits on Malm@@ ö .
Maria meets his debut at the Champions League at Tuesday and helps going to leave at Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani has held course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
Santa Maria met in less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts when the French master had brought to the way , but afterwards they were increased a number of occas@@ ions before they finally increased its approach as Cav@@ ani at the 6@@ 1st minute a head office .
with Real Madrid and cart@@ ons Don@@ ez@@ k in group A , a strong start to the Swedish Master , as they are not only qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but a impro@@ ving on the way to the four quarters in each of the last three camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s .
but while they got the points it was no bas@@ es@@ pi@@ el of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ Brah@@ im@@ ovi@@ cs , before the gate . he later became the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association , with whom he started his illustrations in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or back@@ ward in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to create and relax@@ ed , even if there are certain things we have to stay in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; it is a good mark .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I would not say that we have had one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ Brah@@ im@@ ovic was returned in one of three changes over the Paris team that could take place a 2 : 2 draw on its own space against Bordeaux in the first le@@ ague , but it was put down in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an over@@ throw was named after the man who was taken over the next level in Europe when he was taken over the next month of Manchester United , and he interpre@@ ted to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone would believe that 3D would get a great victory that was dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off , to reach this level , entered at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national play@@ ers on the field and was elev@@ ated with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle area .
but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who included far to the Kevin Trap@@ per posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered a little in the attack .
instead , there were some more sometimes , with some errors and bad , not last of I@@ Brah@@ im@@ ovic , which was not less than five att@@ emp@@ ts , and then was given at the first half of the year , after Cav@@ ani had been used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he po@@ inted much more ti@@ ck when he brought his player to the game , and it was a pass by I@@ Brah@@ im@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a tor@@ rent , which was given by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the sign@@ posts ...
the second goal was finally shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er sco@@ red his sixth season open@@ er , after I@@ Brah@@ im@@ ovic had a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts on that Malm@@ ö in the game can be back to stop and just a high@@ ligh@@ tening of Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz again , before a replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been ok@@ ed a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later to show a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we played only in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualification are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther capacity now
there are almost 500 years after the re@@ formation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Luther capacity .
in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino has been bapt@@ ised so far in the park on the Opp@@ o @-@ Hill in the name of the German re@@ form@@ ators .
in the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now called &quot; German the@@ olog@@ ian of Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was contrac@@ ted by the Prot@@ estant Ch@@ urches in Rome by the fel@@ low@@ ship of the ev@@ angel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ mem@@ bered that the prot@@ est in the city of the pop@@ es about cent@@ uries has often been living in ally att@@ or@@ ate their faith .
with the square become visible in symbo@@ lic way that its tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) thought it as a young August@@ in@@ erm@@ en at the end of the year 1510 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city then as comm@@ erci@@ ally fall into sin .
its negative impressions should take him to view of the hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later strug@@ gle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the dis@@ per@@ ative church with his me@@ adows .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus ( gilded ) D@@ orn@@ grain size is one of the main station that has painted the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and ex@@ cre@@ ations .
in the beginning was the Word ?
No , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which is now published with magnificent pictures .
in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs his very personal Inter@@ pret@@ ations bi@@ blind stories on paper and linen .
his &quot; Language &quot; with colour@@ ful colors and fantastic shapes that the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - what is no longer valid identity with &quot; fun@@ ny &quot; pictures .
on the contr@@ ary , adapted to the particular properties , that can work pretty well .
for some three years , Ot@@ mar alt@@ ed worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he met a subj@@ ective original language from the many theme of the &quot; Bu@@ ches of all books . &quot;
created for cycles , these topics like cross@@ ed , pl@@ agues , commandments or f@@ ather@@ ing .
he has also fas@@ c@@ inated the spont@@ ane@@ ously by several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his em@@ ph@@ asis on artistic books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , based on painting with the respective bi@@ ble places .
he interpre@@ ted by the Ot@@ mar alto selected bi@@ plane and translated into this very day in recent cont@@ ing@@ es . &quot;
these texts are as a associated mirror of al@@ ts painting .
nest@@ led in the original Bi@@ bel@@ lion by Martin Luther and each of a set of the artist who form@@ ulates on their own personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jew@@ ellery band has golden Let@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old plays twice a deep in@@ sight into its soul , his em@@ ot@@ ions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
em@@ ot@@ ions were ulti@@ mat@@ ely strug@@ gl@@ ed at all the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that att@@ acked the stri@@ ct Prot@@ estant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; since the education was on narrow with the pipe floor , &quot; it is remin@@ is@@ cent of Ot@@ mar .
&quot; I tried to work out to bear witness about me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
his second &#91; is &#93; , who art the art in faster time to help me : &quot; the perc@@ eption of images is influ@@ enced by Re@@ kl@@ ame , and this is quite loud .
symbo@@ lic is going to begin .
artists have a different l@@ ust and W@@ onne , things to show .
pictures always have a bit intelligen@@ ce and are not decorative .
&quot; in that way , I am a Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Old wants to leave the viewer for the pictures &quot; in the pictures &quot; let them go , dis@@ covering , and feel that power they have : &quot; the image will be looking for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was founded on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation , &quot; already has been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like what he took with his pictures . &quot;
Alt have not been designed to record the Bible only , but for it c@@ rucial for him , myst@@ eri@@ ous topics .
&quot; that was no cooperation with eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ East : &quot; here it works for the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; created a picture in the Bible .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find his life to de@@ ep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fl@@ ax@@ paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be inaugurated on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .

the DF@@ B increases its commitment to refugees from 2003 , the Bundesliga sets a clear sign at the weekend .
soccer re@@ acts committed to themselves in Germany and as@@ sures its assistance to the adv@@ ise of increasing problems .
&quot; I get the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ uni@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; since the principle of no@@ body say nothing but I have nothing to do nothing . &quot;
&quot; I have to prove any interested in this subject in the handle , said DF@@ B chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
by the annual meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refuge@@ e camps in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and trust the State Minister of Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chanc@@ ell@@ in . &quot;
&quot; there will be the topic to play a central role , &quot; announced he . &quot;
football can help and help .
but the dec@@ is@@ ive turn@@ outs have to ask policy .
this is why the German Bundesliga was therefore exp@@ ands its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Stiftung we have been able that this program declared that by 2019 , Ni@@ ers@@ bach explained on the edge of the UEFA Cup in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
even some Bundes@@ lists support this program .
already in this weekend the 36 professional use also set a clear sign when it will apply to the left Hobby Hand@@ ler ( Herm@@ es ) the imprint &quot; We help - # Re@@ fuge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make sure to make all help , where they can only be , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ y V@@ öller &apos;s &quot; Bild &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; self @-@ engineer . &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e dr@@ ama will definitely go away , none may have taken away . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;ve managed so , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our opportunities in order to help many refugees who have already looks so incre@@ di@@ bly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
ho@@ en@@ hei@@ ms Manager Peter Ret@@ ain said to a &quot; pro@@ min@@ ent sign of le@@ ague . &quot;
for the European Championship trials for Hungary on this Friday the national team of women charges 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach had called Re@@ fuge@@ es supporting refugees as a large commun@@ al plant in German soccer . &quot;
that all 36 license deals with its venues in their places , be great .
the so great is that small and smallest det@@ ect@@ uses are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we have spent , will be living in football .
&quot; that is of an enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association is represented in conjunction with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government of 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; they have already called the whole sum in 2015 , called Ni@@ ers@@ bach .

in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all ho@@ pes will be gro@@ unded to a com@@ eb@@ ack by Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europa League final .
the national player will also be missing to the table leader of the soccer le@@ ague in Du@@ ell with the FK Krasno@@ dar staged on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t leave it on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga head to Leverkusen again , the B@@ VB @-@ Coach opened : &quot; we will re@@ ck@@ on with a return from him to Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pro@@ s Tu@@ chel is not only change to the re@@ us position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the ke@@ eper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ chi@@ ons takes place the place of Chief ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at a absolute top level , &quot; the football teachers are the world champion .
if Wei@@ den appears in future in all Europe League games , but sw@@ immer is open .

the for@@ aging testim@@ ony of Mit@@ er Re@@ us that the fin@@ al@@ ley for the B@@ VB in Europe League will be the goal to re@@ ward the Mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for perfect : &quot; so it is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good opportunity to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ cars : government wants to become a iter@@ ator for Germany
following the account of the federal government , it is to be head of the car techn@@ ological adv@@ ances .
the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday as a strategy on Wednesday , from the house of traffic Department Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides the capital of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the edge of the Autom@@ esse International Motor Show from a &quot; new Mob@@ ility age . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase the traffic safety and take less stress , just d@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the topic on his Am@@ t@@ sk@@ ol@@ ites from the G7 states that participate in the IAA , even with representatives of the industry .
the strategy of the Ministry of Transport Ministry put on the importance of the mobile broad@@ band internet and a gener@@ ous expansion to digital list@@ ening .
for the launch of new technology , there is currently a test track at the 9 in Bavaria .
in order to capture the driver &quot; No additional cont@@ empl@@ ative risks , &quot; the federal government will check the legal framework conditions &quot; and where necessary , adap@@ t to the new developments . &quot;
in Germany , Germany becomes quite an internation@@ ally ack@@ n@@ owle@@ dged that the allowed top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 stro@@ be increased .
in addition , the Federal Government will also introduce a change in the Vienna Convention , that previously suggested the human be@@ ings as a driver .
when automated driving will continue in increasing the car the guided tour , the driver is more and more on the passenger .
technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras to capture the environment and the data in seconds .
according to the Federal Ministry of Finance , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be techn@@ ically possible to 2020 .
you can still be able to expect vehicle access to public roads &quot; from 2004 to 2020 . &quot;
the ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ion in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany app@@ reci@@ ated the authors of the study by 2025 on some 8.4 billion euros .
the digital net@@ working of the board can lead to more safety and efficiency on road traffic , &quot; the SPD @-@ traffic @-@ cr@@ itic Sören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability in acc@@ id@@ ents and security of the personal data of the driver was clear clearly .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americ@@ ans .
one on Wednesday at the AA fac@@ ed survey of the For@@ sa Institute dep@@ end to the result that only eight percent of the German un@@ believ@@ ing that in the next ten years will get through 32 percent in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 2025 with aut@@ or@@ om @-@ assi@@ sted cars , which is 33 percent in the USA .
in Germany there are not yet ready to leave the motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts in Germany to leave their own car .
after a collection of the output of Bit@@ com@@ a would give only seven percent to complete control during the total ride on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , this could represent 15 percent in current transport , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good each Vi@@ ated would be able to control the car control under no circum@@ st@@ ances .

Gaul@@ tier fe@@ els to be one En@@ f@@ ant terri@@ ble
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures bas@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the Designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : sho@@ vel sw@@ ap that can look rag@@ ged with video proj@@ ections .
you have the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the mod@@ es@@ z@@ ene - so that he has put men in Romans .
&quot; I can &apos;t say this day that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terri@@ ble the Haute Cout@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previous was it , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ Walk &quot; ( From civil servants to the wal@@ de ) , which is an luck to the fas@@ hi@@ oners to the Hy@@ po Cultural Foundation , it is a luck that the fashion cre@@ ator has changed his initial position at a vision over its person .
actually , in contrast , for this time he was a bit after me , he said . &quot;
when you dies , one comes into the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Canadian Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just nice gar@@ ments , &quot; said the director of the Kunst@@ halle , Roger Di@@ ed@@ eren .
it is walk about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits come back to an in@@ sight into the situation of man &apos;s history , who has ever been successfully completed a voc@@ ational training in the world .
therefore , the watch is not structured , but it is an excellent cho@@ re@@ ograph@@ ed total plastics , which was used for much effort : in order to add the doll@@ s , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged .
14 metric tons of material have been closed according to the information given by the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the beginning of the Ok@@ tober@@ fest another special f@@ man@@ ker@@ l was yet another special case : a leather handle out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are che@@ er than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier .
the T@@ eddy SRP : T@@ eddy is seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tender , att@@ emp@@ ts to design the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in the football ) he moved to his T@@ eddy B@@ H@@ s and gar@@ ments , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a pupp@@ et , his parents have not allowed him .
the designs of fashion he was then brought later .
he ste@@ aring steel sign@@ atures and saw the designs of other design@@ ers , just as the Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it then .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the Model Models .
they re@@ aff@@ ed nothing but kept the cl@@ am@@ ans .
Jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ed tip as Mode @-@ N@@ ic
previously , it went to the long em@@ bro@@ id@@ ery in and around Pl@@ auen to make meter .
the em@@ bro@@ idered fabri@@ cs and points were created in great quantity for customers that they are contri@@ but@@ ted to the ceil@@ ings and gard@@ ines .
it is not working today anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mod@@ ules .
instead , the mode is important again .
in the beginning of the pl@@ au@@ c@@ er l@@ ace mode a large role played through the textiles processing industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is a few examples : Tip in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional tra@@ inees .
in all , bil@@ ly , the so @-@ called Vintage mode that rej@@ ects on stil@@ ts Stil@@ ep@@ o@@ chen , an incre@@ as@@ ingly end@@ ment potential .
who is not used in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
with us she make half of all orders .
Mod@@ esp@@ hes Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies Member of Bran@@ ch &apos;s Pl@@ au@@ ges and Stick@@ eries .
only they can carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of the turnover is de@@ alt .
private sk@@ ies and whol@@ es@@ ale are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly able to help customers on this way .
the mass ware become more che@@ aper in the Asian space and is distributed exclusively through chains .
also we@@ ak@@ ness of export , currently in Russia and the USA .
so sufficient reasons for new ways .
the industry association has also been trying to evalu@@ ate environ@@ ment@@ ally con@@ sci@@ ousness as Cord@@ ula Bauer of the em@@ bro@@ id@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we lead a quality seal that we prove that we will receive ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; it is also refers to the materials . &quot;
the designer U@@ te Schmidt was taught at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger foreign office of the Western University of Zw@@ ick@@ au - thanks to the Faculty of Applied Arts , University of Applied Arts , and speci@@ ali@@ zes in em@@ bro@@ id@@ ery and tips .
in order to deci@@ de the competition about the Asian space , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
this needs time and cour@@ age .
there is a voltage range between the fr@@ ott@@ est ideas of design@@ ers and establ@@ ish@@ ments , which are mainly econom@@ ically , &quot; says Schmidt .
that is why , a existing design is only slightly varied to hold a customer base .
some years ago animated tex@@ tures Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter has been re@@ gre@@ ased the historic snow@@ man top .
she ends up the machine at some places of small c@@ ows .
the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ sch@@ mi@@ ed@@ em@@ ei@@ ster@@ in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße showed that : &quot; before I could do not start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ges . &quot;
now they used the snow@@ shoes for their jewelry .
in a complex procedure they pr@@ ono@@ unc@@ ed the patterns in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ au@@ ener l@@ ace - j@@ ung and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies the United States , to Australia and Finland - especially on customers whose ancest@@ ors have lived in eing and surroundings .
with that I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ ador of the pl@@ au@@ c@@ er point .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit in coar@@ se fishing
the European Commission int@@ ends to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large room rates and consum@@ ing considerably higher dose of ner@@ v@@ eng@@ es .
the consumer organization Fo@@ od@@ watch , which is a corresponding working post@@ paper of the EU , critical hits : &quot; risks , and ad@@ verse events are related to severe economic and environmental policy . as well as Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Fo@@ od@@ watch .
in addition , the limits of the ner@@ v@@ eng@@ i@@ ft@@ es should be raised by a little fish at the end of the food chain like Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; polit@@ ics to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of Mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
great cra@@ b@@ fish are already loaded as strong as long as mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the applicable limits , about 50 per cent of the catch are not sold .
according to dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.5 percent were non @-@ wi@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
in return to this loos@@ ening the EU cor@@ respond to Fo@@ od@@ ology the limit values in other f@@ ishes of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
fo@@ od@@ ology recorded this as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller peac@@ ek@@ e@@ ep@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low as low as they are the planned peak values already today .
the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ all be therefore &quot; a de@@ fi@@ able Abl@@ ation man@@ eu@@ ver that assi@@ sts in the economy by the economy , declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt alone .
mer@@ cury is a f@@ atten@@ ed heavy metals that are pl@@ en@@ rich@@ ed over the food @-@ chain above all in smo@@ kers .
consequ@@ ently , the Federal Government therefore war@@ ned that &quot; already low amounts are particularly with the lost shafts of ner@@ v@@ ous system .
the Federal Ministry of Environment announced on his homepage in terms of the previous price , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population will not be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury sco@@ red primarily through the coal consumption in the environment .
according to a written information of the federal ministry , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock produce more than six tons of mer@@ cury from the year , two thir@@ ds of the German exports represent total amount .
the concentration of Mercury in fishing approximately in El@@ be , the Rhine and the Danube is &quot; perman@@ ently and super@@ int@@ end on , &quot; mir@@ rors &quot; mirror &quot; in March from paper .
last year , in the past year , war@@ n@@ ings in fish already reported to the most common health Ris@@ ks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SFF .
