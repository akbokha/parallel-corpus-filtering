the present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ader Report ( EP@@ AR ) which is explained as the Committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) has been assess@@ ed to recommendations concerning the application of pharmaceu@@ ticals .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package template ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tray ( tablets , which are in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ectors solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ uc@@ inations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic disease , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( Peri@@ odic att@@ endance ) altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate @-@ severe episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the drug .
injection @-@ solution is used for rapid control of dist@@ orted disorder or behavi@@ our@@ al dys@@ functions if the or@@ ale intake of pharmaceu@@ ticals is not possible .
&quot; in both ill@@ nesses you can use the solution to take or the mel@@ ting tray for patients , the closing of tablets trouble . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use other medicines , which are as shown as A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , the dosage should be adapted by A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of the ner@@ ve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol seems probably mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tryp@@ t@@ amin ( also Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tryp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less measure than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tryp@@ t@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia , and bi@@ polar disorder seems to play a role , the activity of the brain can reduce norm@@ ative or man@@ ic symptoms , and their re@@ occur shall prev@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , to prevent the re@@ occur of symptoms , has been studied in three studies about up to one year . &quot;
the eff@@ ic@@ acy of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or similar diseases that compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a further study conducted A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that have been stabil@@ ized to 160 patients when the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy injection @-@ solution was used in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that is dist@@ orted by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( a different anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ik@@ um ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies the change of symptoms experienced by means of a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder , or the number of patients who studied at the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies in order to investig@@ ate how the body can take the mel@@ ting tray and the solution to res@@ hold ( absor@@ bed ) .
&quot; in the two studies in the two studies showed patients who received A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in dos@@ es of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction of symptoms stopped as the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in application for treating the bi@@ polar disorder decre@@ ased A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms are more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy &apos;s participation in addition to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the revival of man@@ ent episodes in previously treated patients and when it was in addition to existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg cans have also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms stopped and were similar effectively like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy for use ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ y@@ ram@@ id@@ als , He@@ ath@@ y ( in@@ flamm@@ ation ) , stor@@ ing , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , f@@ atigue , nau@@ tical ( nau@@ sea ) , f@@ atigue , and ex@@ haus@@ tion , ru@@ ben@@ o@@ ness , In@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee for Human@@ ities issued ( CH@@ MP ) h@@ ed to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy for the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and from Central to severe man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes had to over@@ wei@@ gh the risks associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee on the result came to the outcome that the benefits of inj@@ ectors solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance , if a oral therapy is not suitable towards the risks . &quot;
June 2004 received the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the domestic use of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a starting dose of 15 mg / day once daily except meals .
an enhanced effectiveness of dos@@ ing over a day dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as Mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I@@ - disturb@@ ance in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ation should be considered when clinical factors this justi@@ fy this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ fl@@ ector from the combination therapy is set to be reduced the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dosage will be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ izi@@ a behavior belongs to psych@@ ot@@ eric diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change an anti @-@ mental therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epi@@ demi@@ ological study demonstrated that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no elev@@ ated Su@@ izi@@ a risk compared to other antibiot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine diseases ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ anti@@ bacter@@ ial diseases ) , cer@@ vic@@ al cancer ( de@@ hydr@@ ates , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressure drugs ) or hyp@@ erten@@ sion ( including ak@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which was one year or less lasted , there were occas@@ ional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; if at one with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y patients to occur patient signs and symptoms of a sp@@ atial dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ese , should be considered to reduce the dosage or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed , which has a m@@ ns h@@ ashes or dar@@ ares high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all antibiot@@ ics , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with her@@ amp@@ fan@@ fare in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with patients with psych@@ osis had to be associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who have been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a elev@@ ated ster@@ is@@ iko compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixing dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the An@@ talk for un@@ wanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment patients . &quot;
&quot; Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients diagnos@@ ed with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ mental agents , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related events with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ic agents patients who allow direct linking .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ h@@ ag@@ ie and weak@@ ness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monit@@ ored regularly with regard to a det@@ eri@@ oration of glu@@ cos@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; a weight increase is generally known in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia , and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the application of antibiot@@ ics , with which weight increases as a part @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the Central Danube is caution , when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medic@@ inal effects associated with alcohol or other central pharmaceutical drugs ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , whereby this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy pos@@ ing increases a high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max exists remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be similar dos@@ ing reduction . &quot;
at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ans can result the common application with an effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plastic @-@ centr@@ ations from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ si@@ ves Met@@ abo@@ lic .
when one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should over@@ wei@@ gh the potential benefits for patients .
&quot; other high @-@ effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tr@@ acon@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ est@@ or@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore should be similar dos@@ ing reduction . &quot;
according to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors should be the dosage of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y on the dos@@ ing level before the beginning of the accompan@@ ying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be compared with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies dos@@ es from 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol a day not significant effect on the met@@ abo@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dextro@@ se / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( Dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph@@ an ) . &quot;
&quot; the patient should be done , their doctor will be dis@@ advant@@ ageous if they are pregn@@ ant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; due to the in@@ adequate data base for the safety of man and due to the production studies at the animal , this drug should not be applied in pregnancy , unless it is possible to justi@@ fy the potential risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ologist , patients should be war@@ ned to use dangerous machines , including power vehicles to use , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side @-@ effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than under plac@@ ebo or were classi@@ fied as possible medical relevant effects ( * ) :
&quot; frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; Schizophr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term @-@ term study conducted over 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total reduced inci@@ dence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , Dy@@ ston@@ ie and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ie , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 57,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term schedule of 26 weeks was the inci@@ dence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % for patients on plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a different controlled long @-@ term study stage over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ ost@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;

all patients participating in this study patients was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ essel before they were either received on Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indic@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es between the beginning of the study and the period period between the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also put the results of a study in which the effects of a study were examined using E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 canc@@ ers who received an chem@@ otherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients who were caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by patients , which were maintained on se@@ se@@ amed , in the same dimensions as with those patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the patients , the continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received , an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
the most commonly referred to by Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to sy@@ mp@@ tom of an En@@ c@@ ic@@ opathy ( Hir@@ n@@ problem@@ e ) such as su@@ dden , st@@ ech@@ eful head@@ ache and Tur@@ b@@ ulation can lead . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who might be exc@@ essive ( allergi@@ c ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections among the skin is not recommended for treatment of kid@@ ney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that it is trig@@ ger@@ ed by no allergi@@ c reactions . &quot;
&quot; the committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) h@@ ated to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of Pro@@ of proof , that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and eff@@ ect@@ ric@@ ation profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; if the HB increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) each month or a HB value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose is to minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ hic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ist an@@ emia ) between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl . &quot;
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a utility risk pro@@ gression under the participation of each patient who should take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elek@@ tive orthopedi@@ c procedure , if possible , before the start of ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;

&quot; there is a increased risk for thro@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ m@@ ical events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ar@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on the whole survive cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far this results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ver@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin with chem@@ otherapy , which can be transferred to 13 g / dl , since few patients were included with these characteristics in the veri@@ fied data . &quot;

&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et may only be prescribed by doctors , experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attr@@ acted to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and it was investig@@ ated the number of sp@@ ine and hips over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study com@@ pris@@ ed 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently studied a Hip fr@@ act@@ ory ; it was investig@@ ated the number of fr@@ ac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( one other Bis@@ pho@@ sp@@ hon@@ at ) . &quot;
main indic@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine Pho@@ sp@@ hat@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( a enz@@ ym@@ ble ) in Ser@@ um ( a enz@@ ym@@ es ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ aci@@ ties , under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patient under plac@@ ebo around 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all the Pati@@ ents , under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) with those of plac@@ ebo was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with Hip fr@@ act@@ ory had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a fr@@ act@@ ory ( 92 of 1 065 ) compared to 13 % of patients on plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta meet within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in inf@@ usion inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who could possibly be over@@ delic@@ ate ( allergi@@ c ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic or other Bis@@ pho@@ sp@@ hon@@ ate or one of the other ingredients .

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ader Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained , as the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) has been assess@@ ed to recommendations concerning the application of pharmaceu@@ ticals . &quot;
Ac@@ tos will be used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular superior patients ) . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can also be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular superior patients ) which are not satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest dream@@ ful dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ r@@ ile or In@@ sul@@ ulin can be kept in combination with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ har@@ n@@ ings@@ s or ins@@ ulin with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment ( lower blood sugar ) ; here the dosage of the Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ings@@ s or the ins@@ ulin to be reduced .
&quot; this means that the physical In@@ s@@ ulin can be better im@@ posed , and the blood sugar levels , thus creating type @-@ 2 diabetes is better set . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined , thereby the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ r@@ als , in addition they received up to 3,5 years of either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , allowing the blood sugar levels by applying the dos@@ es of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional forkli@@ ft from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ ness in a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values about 0,@@ 94 % , while the additional forkli@@ fts of plac@@ ebo on a lo@@ wering of 0,35 % led . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and In@@ s@@ ulin have been investig@@ ated to In@@ s@@ ulin , a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values of 0,69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.3 % in patients who participated in addition to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper breath@@ es ( encour@@ ages ) , weight increase and hy@@ po@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( decre@@ ased sensitivity towards matur@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients with liver problems , or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , in@@ fertility or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin ( high K@@ et@@ on@@ mirror - S@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was chosen that Ac@@ tos within the scope of a mon@@ otherapy ( when any use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 provided the European Commission of the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approved permission for the domestic accounts of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved , and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wor@@ ding &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown for combining with In@@ s@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and with which met@@ form@@ able due to con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations or int@@ oler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , for patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endanger@@ ed by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart disease or sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ p@@ aci@@ ousness ) , the doctor should start treatment with the low@@ est available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be located on signs and symptoms of a her@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight increases or o@@ dem@@ os to be observed , especially those with reduced car@@ dium reserve . &quot;
patients should be assess@@ ed at signs and symptoms of a her@@ in@@ suff@@ oc@@ ular to be weight@@ ed and o@@ dem@@ os when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and temporary advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
this study result@@ ed in an increase in reports of in@@ fertility but not led to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
patients with increased extin@@ ction cups ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standardi@@ zation ) or with other signs of a liver disease can not be used by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror up to 3 @-@ increments of the upper limit of the stand@@ ar@@ der are increased as soon as possible .
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed to prove a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , f@@ atigue , f@@ atigue , f@@ atigue , f@@ atigue , f@@ atigue , f@@ atigue , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver data values . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is continued until the prevention of the laboratory parameters of the clinical trial will be guided .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight increases , which can be glori@@ fied by fat deposits , and in some cases it is connected with a liquid . &quot;
as a result of an hem@@ or@@ atory entered the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a slight reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ er ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ um@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.2 % ) .
similar changes have been observed at compar@@ ative studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ ym@@ ins and In@@ s@@ ulin ( relative reduction in the hem@@ og@@ ym@@ ins and In@@ s@@ ulin ( relative reduction in the hem@@ og@@ ym@@ ins around 1 @-@ 2 % and of hem@@ at@@ oc@@ um@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased in@@ tru@@ in@@ duct@@ ance in patients who received Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale branch or triple @-@ match therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ index@@ es , including pip@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , over a occurr@@ ence or det@@ eri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s . &quot;
it is un@@ clear whether between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s have deli@@ ber@@ ately be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s to report on the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s ; an appropriate oph@@ thal@@ mic detection should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events with regard to bone bre@@ asts , controlled , double flash@@ es clinical studies over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the deli@@ ber@@ ate fr@@ act@@ ory @-@ inci@@ dence was 1,@@ 9 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treatment of women and 1,@@ 1 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with an equ@@ ation @-@ media . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , study about 3.5 years on the examination of cardiovascular diseases , fr@@ ac@@ tures , fr@@ ac@@ tures , compared to 23 / 905 ( 2,5 % ; 0,5 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients were treated with a compar@@ ative operations . &quot;
the patient should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes you desire or this entry is to implement the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tik or Phar@@ mak@@ odynamics , in War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ co@@ um@@ on and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions involving drugs , which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enz@@ ym@@ es , e.g. or@@ ale contr@@ ac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clo@@ spor@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ alb@@ lo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ cher ( one Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) results in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( one Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ du@@ ck ) results in a lo@@ wering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to it that among treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which decre@@ ases in the pregnancy Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistant to the mother and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single case : unknown ( from present data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the bre@@ ach of the left , as they can also be observed in other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on tr@@ aten AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents over the upper limit of the stand@@ ings are frequently placed on the same as plac@@ ebo , however rare than in comparison groups of met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ r@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in a Out@@ come study when patients with existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ inary disorder was the inci@@ dence of severe her@@ in@@ suff@@ on by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1,6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch has been rare about Her@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with In@@ s@@ ulin or in patients with in@@ fertility in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it was a summary of reports of un@@ wanted events with regard to bone bre@@ asts from rand@@ om@@ ized , controlled , double flash@@ es clinical studies over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the associated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients in comparison with compar@@ ative operations . &quot;
&quot; in the course over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , fr@@ ac@@ tures near 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of the patient treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treatment , compared to 23 / 905 ( 2,5 % ) with patient @-@ media . &quot;
&quot; while taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work over a activation of specific key recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ep@@ tor ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ DS ) ) ) which leads in the animal model to an increased in@@ tru@@ in@@ duct@@ ance of liver , obes@@ ity and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is reduced the glu@@ co@@ se@@ production in the liver and the peri@@ pher@@ al glu@@ co@@ de@@ valuation in case of ins@@ ulin resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ver@@ sus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years to investig@@ ate the time up to re@@ placing the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood sugar was ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ li@@ fied study about 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar were adjusted despite tri@@ mon@@ ati@@ ger optimization phase with ins@@ ulin in@@ sufficient , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; if the harm@@ onic period after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dosage can be increased by once every day 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment course , still there are still tox@@ ic waste ; therefore the patient is recommended for at least during the first six months under treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and patients who had a organ@@ tran@@ splan@@ t as there was not investig@@ ated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , at 1 0@@ 72 patients took part , the effectiveness of three different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ es ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with a plac@@ ebo ( pse@@ udo @-@ t@@ ol ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) . &quot;
two dos@@ es were compared with Al@@ lo@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year in 762 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kid@@ ney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indic@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients whose res@@ ell@@ ular pi@@ egel in the blood during the last three measurements at 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) the patients who took the A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who had a res@@ ell@@ ular pressure in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , and in no of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , penetration , nau@@ sea and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac , it may also be a increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) h@@ ated to the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in the blood has more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the process of ser@@ um@@ har@@ al re@@ centr@@ ations in Pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their kid@@ ney function ( 58 % in the group of normal kid@@ ney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary final point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ re@@ con@@ centr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact @-@ study ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh @-@ con@@ centr@@ ation of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension of the phase 3 showed that the permanent lo@@ wering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh bri@@ cks on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , that is needed less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients needed any treatment against a pl@@ aster ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of po@@ ison@@ ed sizes , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of tox@@ ins until month 24 . &quot;

recommendations on the decline in full blo@@ t The dose should first be based on the clinical assessment of de@@ grad@@ ation and compatibility in the single blo@@ cking of full blo@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ni@@ li@@ m checks .
it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ ation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during refurb@@ ishment . &quot;

&quot; da Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose of several days , until the ste@@ ady State is gone . &quot;
&quot; the information in clinical trials will make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the tal@@ mirror in blood 20 g / ml not exc@@ eed . &quot;
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m usually lies in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 g / ml and in am@@ ination - and cor@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent development therapy of liver , kid@@ ney and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious un@@ wanted events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ ories or other side effects , which may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or exc@@ essive position . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dos@@ es ; con@@ stell@@ ation of the wor@@ ding or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ w@@ ful control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ ation of an experienced medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

&quot; because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a her@@ ing of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant surgery during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ arr@@ h@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be subject to significant variations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was considered as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , the chamber or se@@ pt@@ ary hyp@@ ert@@ ro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , an already existing heart suffer from treatment with cor@@ e@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , hyp@@ erten@@ sion or Leb@@ er@@ dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation , and o@@ ils . &quot;

the simultaneous use of pharmaceu@@ ticals or herbal medicines that are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duct@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m .
it is therefore recommen@@ ds the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood level in comparison of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A anti @-@ metabolism and to set the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ dose for maintaining equ@@ itable concentr@@ ations . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

&quot; da Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can increase the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ ac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , and therefore the hor@@ mone ex@@ position can increase in decisions on recep@@ tive measures to be particularly careful . &quot;
the results of tier@@ es have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m potenti@@ ally reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ma@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their sem@@ iconduct@@ or .

adv@@ ent is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ ia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditional , inn@@ ate blo@@ cking disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application depends on whether we are used to treat ble@@ eding or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedure .
patients with H@@ äm@@ ophil@@ ia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack of blo@@ ody crimes as ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extr@@ acted from human plas@@ ma but after a method which is called &apos; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ Technology &quot; :
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a G@@ en ( DNA ) was introduced to trans@@ mit it to the formation of the human sense . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ent is another in the European Union promised drugs called re@@ plac@@ ate , similar , however , is different , so that the drug contains no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with serious and moderate ag@@ ophil@@ ia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medication has been investig@@ ated by the prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was awarded to the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are sw@@ in@@ del , head@@ ache , Py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who might be exc@@ essive ( allergi@@ c ) against human mind factor VIII , Maus@@ er or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other ingredients are . &quot;
March 2004 followed by the European Commission of the Company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a approval for the main building of Adv@@ ate throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defic@@ iency after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .
&quot; at the following ug@@ onic events , the factor of VIII activity during the course period is not under the given plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
inj@@ ections all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the ac@@ ute imp@@ air@@ ment are elimin@@ ated .
inj@@ ections all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patient is above .
&quot; during the treatment , the control of an adequate dose , and frequency of inj@@ ections will be a proper determining factor for the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma level . &quot;
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII various in vi@@ vo recovery and change different half times .

&quot; if the expected factor is not achieved in VIII plastic activities or if the ble@@ eding is not domin@@ ating with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed in order to prove an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ters , it is possible that the factor of VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be er@@ ased . &quot;
the passage rate is to be determined by the patient with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min .
the formation of neutral anti@@ bodies ( in@@ bit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with yeast infections .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII ated Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins that is quantitative in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da Ass@@ ay quantitative .
&quot; the risk to develop in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ position on the largest and of gene@@ tic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the patient patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) has been known to more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ development , the conversion of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ act of ( low@@ est ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare adv@@ ent of the h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ ia A with women lie over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still @-@ time experiences . &quot;
&quot; the most significant number of patients consec@@ u@@ tive AD@@ R@@ s were in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who appear all the patients previously un@@ treated patients , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fe@@ ver and sw@@ in@@ del ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;

blood circulation was maintained throughout the time and both the factor of VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plas@@ ma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values .

the main dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay @-@ logis@@ tic symptoms resulting from patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment were reported .
&quot; during the study , patients tru@@ sting their symptoms every 12 hours into a di@@ ary and rated with a standard sk@@ ala , such as hard the symptoms in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in cont@@ empl@@ ation of all hy@@ ve @-@ logis@@ tic symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ odi@@ ze , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients , the pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone took place alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nose is considered , the patients among aer@@ ina@@ ze showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms around 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of Aer@@ in@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ den ( cardi@@ ac ) , an@@ or@@ ec@@ y ( appe@@ tiz@@ ing ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ y ( in@@ flamm@@ ation ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ y ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ in@@ arity ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ ness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ ze may not be used in patients who might be exc@@ essive ( allergi@@ c ) against di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ ze may also not be used in patients who have caused Hyper@@ thy@@ el ( increased water pressure ) , ch@@ ain@@ less ( hyp@@ erten@@ sion ) , Hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( over@@ temperature of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already have an ug@@ hness of the thy@@ ro@@ id di@@ arr@@ he@@ al ) or have had a risk for a moral stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission concluded by the company SP Europe for approval by Aer@@ in@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole ( i.e. , without cr@@ y , to break or to k@@ ap ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data and eff@@ ic@@ acy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after compl@@ eting the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days to limit the activity of Pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time .
&quot; after the decline of sw@@ elling of the mu@@ co@@ upon in the upper bar@@ ge , the treatment can be continued when needed with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity of combined application of pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ gu@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , erg@@ ot@@ amin , Di@@ chlor@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other De@@ con@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , per@@ or@@ ot@@ amine , mus@@ edr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc. ) . &quot;
security and the effectiveness of these combinations have not been tested for this patient &apos;s patient and the data are not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ ze were not tested in patients with kid@@ ney or liver inter@@ fer@@ ing and the data are not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyp@@ erten@@ sion or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ ro@@ ds or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac , nau@@ sea or other neuro@@ logical Sy@@ mp@@ tom ( such as head@@ ache or rein@@ forcement of the head@@ ache ) must be set . &quot;

&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been met , however , not a clin@@ ically relevant interaction or changes in the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ical tests could not be significant differences between the patients with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients with plac@@ ebo patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; it has not been identified for the met@@ abo@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible entity , such inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ mt in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ co@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the imm@@ ort@@ ality of the application of aer@@ in@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancy , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to frequency population . &quot;
&quot; since the reproduction Studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ eph@@ ric properties of Pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be clari@@ fied that it can come in very rare cases to a ben@@ chmark of traffic or the ability to control machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS Depression ( S@@ edi@@ fication , Ap@@ no@@ e , ver@@ apped mental attention , Com@@ an@@ ose , Kom@@ a , cardiovascular diseases ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ uc@@ inations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ als . &quot;

in controlled clinical studies were found at recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg a day no increased frequency compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale app of pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can give further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS ter@@ reg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seas@@ onal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis , with 414 patients Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined using the total cor@@ es for the Sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nas@@ en@@ schl@@ angen@@ sis ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pse@@ ud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment times . &quot;

the eff@@ ic@@ acy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic group groups . &quot;
as part of a single dose for the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ odi@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes after the adoption in plas@@ ma .

for children under the age of 1 to five years the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ ru@@ p . &quot;
for children aged six to eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ ru@@ p . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was conducted in total eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies on seas@@ onal allergi@@ c and two studies in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( Jubilee , number and size of the squ@@ aring , imp@@ air@@ ment of the sle@@ eves and the performance on the days ) before and after sixth treatment . &quot;
&quot; there were further studies to prove that the body can take the Sir@@ up , the solution to take and the mel@@ ting tray in the same way as the tablets and the application with children is unden@@ i@@ able . &quot;
&quot; when allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis led when the results of all studies were summar@@ ized , the two @-@ week treatment performed with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average absor@@ ption of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the Sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ ato should be compared with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who could possibly be over@@ pri@@ ced ( allergi@@ c ) against di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other ingredients are . &quot;
January 2001 the European Commission concluded by the company SP Europe for approval of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms in allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ aci@@ dity and pers@@ ist sm@@ al r@@ hin@@ itis ) , and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are limited experience of clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in with young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ al allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease pro@@ gression and may be recorded according to the def@@ ects of symptoms and to res@@ ume their recycling .
with the pers@@ ist allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergi@@ c time .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not observed in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets were not observed where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been met ( see below ) 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharma@@ co@@ ological study was not emphas@@ ized by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol which is no ampli@@ fied effect of alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , the patients should be clari@@ fied that it can be used in very rare cases that can lead to a loss of traffic or the ability to control machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis and chr@@ onic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most frequently asked side effects which was reported about the more common than at plac@@ ebo were f@@ atigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth@@ ness ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 578 youth@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common @-@ term head@@ ache , these entered at 5.5 % of patients who were treated with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) have been observed , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ in@@ flamm@@ able cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human masturbation as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the Ad@@ ul@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ S@@ elect@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple profession@@ ally , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day is given over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect is described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharma@@ co@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days was given , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ ing study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measuring sizes , including rein@@ forcement subj@@ ective fl@@ ails , or the tasks that are related to the fing@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and ju@@ ice of the nose , ju@@ ice , tr@@ en@@ ings and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as ju@@ ice at the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , can allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms , also in inter@@ actively r@@ hin@@ itis and pers@@ isti@@ zing allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis will be defined as a occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isti@@ zing allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis will be defined as a occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; like using the overall appearance of life at Rh@@ ino @-@ Kon@@ junk@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown , di@@ min@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively emphas@@ ized by seas@@ onal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
the chr@@ onic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was exam@@ ining the under@@ lying path@@ physi@@ ology since the under@@ lying path@@ physi@@ ology import@@ antly the simil@@ arity with the different forms is similar and chr@@ onic patients easier pro@@ spec@@ tively record .
as the hist@@ ori@@ zer is a great factor among all the ur@@ ari@@ zed diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except in the chr@@ onic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria also leads to an improvement of symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chr@@ onic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squ@@ aring at the end of the first dos@@ is@@ inter@@ val . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , in chr@@ onic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the minority of patients who do not rely on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of plac@@ ebo patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of the sleep and the vig@@ il@@ ance as is measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of this variable .
&quot; in a Phar@@ is@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients @-@ dem@@ ograph@@ ics with the general seas@@ onal r@@ hin@@ itis can be compared to 4 % of patients a higher concentration of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no lasting points for a clin@@ ically relevant sor@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; it has not yet identified the met@@ abo@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible entity , but inter@@ actions with other drugs do not be excluded completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ mt in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ one is .
&quot; in a single dos@@ ing room with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg effective meals ( fatty , cal@@ ori@@ ous breakfast ) does not appear on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed pre@@ clin@@ ically studies , in a comparable degree of exposure of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quanti@@ t@@ ative differences in terms of tox@@ icity from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gifts , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to re@@ produce the pre@@ clinical data with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular dangers to the people . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals for the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms in allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ aci@@ dity and pers@@ ist sm@@ al r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the doctor &apos;s doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data are presented to support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper resp@@ ir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in the diagnosis , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin testing . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abo@@ de Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher addi@@ tions ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up with children from 2 to 11 years , the restricted met@@ aboli@@ ze , is identical to the children that are normal met@@ aboli@@ ze . &quot;
this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take care of femin@@ ine problems of a Fru@@ c@@ tose @-@ int@@ oler@@ ance , glu@@ co@@ se @-@ Galac@@ tic absor@@ ption or a Sac@@ char@@ ger Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- In@@ suff@@ iciency of this drug . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not observed where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been met ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharma@@ co@@ ological study was not emphas@@ ized by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol which is no ampli@@ fied effect of alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the total number of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group like at the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ itis and chr@@ onic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary study to adults and young people , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) have been observed , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnos@@ tics S.r.l. Committee ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influ@@ enza by adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and older people to protect flu which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a tri@@ pp@@ ery that could cause a future pand@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ and@@ em@@ ie breaks out when a new trunk of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus , that can easily spread from man to man , because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the submission of the vaccine will det@@ ects the immune system that contained in the vaccine used parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus , as &quot; physi@@ que &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
this is why the immune system later is able to form a touch with a ch@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this Stam@@ ms rapid si@@ RNA .
&quot; subsequently the membran@@ e h@@ ats of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ e surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , clean@@ sed and be used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study centers that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thus , the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not in order to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ ME@@ A for pregn@@ ated vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ als medic@@ inal products for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human immun@@ o@@ weak@@ ening De@@ fic@@ iency Syn@@ drome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not s@@ wal@@ low the capsules are not available as a solution for taking , but these cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be dispos@@ ed if the doctor has checked the anti @-@ tiv@@ ir@@ als drug has been taken before , and the prob@@ ability has assess@@ ed that the virus on the drug will speak . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ als medic@@ inal products . &quot;
&quot; for children aged four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase according to the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in combination with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ als and keeps the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to he@@ al AIDS , however , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus hes@@ it@@ ating the development of with AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ alen pharmaceu@@ ticals , however without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not been treated with prot@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; that with low do@@ si@@ ert@@ em rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r rein@@ forced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was taken with 206 adults , the earlier prot@@ eas@@ iness had been taken with other prot@@ otyp@@ ing numbers . &quot;
main indic@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with no proven concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ectors , namely after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients a Vir@@ us@@ last under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children reduced A@@ gener@@ ase also the vir@@ us@@ last , whereby one had been treated with the children , which were earlier with prot@@ otyp@@ ing numbers , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , the earlier with prot@@ ru@@ in had been treated with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r rein@@ forced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment , just as effective as other prot@@ ru@@ ff : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV that was resistant to four other prot@@ ru@@ in , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a greater waste of vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in patients who took their previous prot@@ est@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ h@@ ö ( blood ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and f@@ atigue ( f@@ atigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who might be exc@@ essive ( allergi@@ c ) against Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients with patients , the cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplements for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are as well as A@@ gener@@ ase , and in high concentr@@ ations in the blood is harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase must take the risk of a li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ( dis@@ dy@@ ing of bone tissue ) , a oste@@ op@@ tic syn@@ dro@@ ms ( dis@@ dy@@ ing of bone tissue ) , or a immun@@ o@@ re@@ v@@ atives syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that will be caused by the recover@@ ing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) h@@ ed to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of prot@@ otypes treated with prot@@ otypes and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharma@@ co@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously been taken not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 approved the European Commission of G@@ la@@ x@@ o Group Limited approved for the domestic use of A@@ gener@@ asis in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs for the treatment of HIV , prot@@ otypes , prot@@ otyp@@ ing adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules to the phar@@ mak@@ es@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r along with low cans of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r should be done with consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance levels and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the biology of Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than from Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence are A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take up to a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the rein@@ forced supplement of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ ung ) must be applied higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a day maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r that should not exc@@ eeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the Phar@@ is@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low cans of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ otyp@@ ing numbers were not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data for un@@ certainty and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharma@@ co@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for adult patients with medium @-@ heavy living dys@@ functions at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe living dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with easier or moderate liver with caution in patients with severe living dys@@ functions it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used simultaneously with pharmaceu@@ ticals who own a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduction Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations and a ver@@ tically therapeutic effect of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cur@@ se of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complic@@ ations of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ am@@ ination with blood .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low cans of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines will be applied ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chr@@ onic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have increased risk for heavy liver actions with potenti@@ ally de@@ d@@ able course . &quot;
for the event of an simultaneous treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chr@@ onic @-@ active Hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of living dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monit@@ ored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ c@@ ok@@ o@@ ids that will not be recommended it is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment the risk system@@ ic cor@@ tical cor@@ tis@@ ation of the effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of secondary function over@@ weigh@@ s ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the det@@ ri@@ ment of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duction Ac@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended by the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic@@ al anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods of identi@@ fying the drug Con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to fat@@ al plas@@ ma &apos;s less than ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abo@@ lic inter@@ actions with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contr@@ ac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monit@@ ored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ental symptoms , especially when dan@@ es even lower cans of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity due to the high Prop@@ y@@ ly@@ mph@@ atic level of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in children under an age of four years , and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set at duration 5 if a r@@ ash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergi@@ c Sy@@ mp@@ tom or the mu@@ co@@ her@@ es ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ est@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that were necessary to their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drugs @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer and@@ ern@@ al anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ ectors , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spont@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ect can develop a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al manip@@ ulation therapy ( ART ) a fl@@ oral reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al infections that leads to severe clinical states or det@@ eri@@ oration of Sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ ans .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial e@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ tical cat@@ astrophe , alcohol consumption , heavy body @-@ mass @-@ index ) , were reported by O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combinations ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Sub@@ str@@ ate with minimal width of A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used simultaneously with pharmaceu@@ ticals and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ate with slight therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmaceu@@ ticals whose agents are mostly changed over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical temp@@ o and to a resistance development . &quot;
at the attempt to ex@@ er@@ ated plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel through a dosage increase of other proteins in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been observed very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes cur@@ vy , the Am@@ per@@ av@@ ir@@ ley and , if possible , the Vir@@ us@@ last to check and to put the cur@@ vy . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required when Nel@@ or@@ avi@@ r along with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is given ( see also E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % reduced , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies have been observed at 600 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r twice daily , and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which is the effectiveness and harm@@ less@@ ness of this treatment . &quot;
52 % reduced when Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which have been reached in combination of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , roughly 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; an dos@@ ing of charge for the simultaneous approval of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a narro@@ wer surveillance , as the effectiveness and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharma@@ co@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in Gab@@ e of E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the Ex@@ position of both prot@@ ect@@ or@@ em@@ mer would be low .
the effect of Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in on other proteins and available data can be found that Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ is possibly possibly sen@@ sus the Ser@@ um Con@@ centr@@ ation of Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be utili@@ zed at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din because of the ver@@ r@@ amp@@ les and possibly subtle plastic mas@@ cul@@ es may be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous forkli@@ fts of Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plas@@ ma centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus associated with a rise of ri@@ bb@@ ing side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended to a reduction of dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; Pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel of both medications be increased in the case of simultaneous adoption . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r once daily led to a increase in C@@ max by K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in Plas@@ ma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ion ) on the 2,@@ 69@@ ple compared to 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a daily basis without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ate , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duct@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to inter@@ actions . &quot;
patients should therefore be seen on tox@@ ic reactions to be monit@@ ored with these drugs when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acid may not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as En@@ cy@@ cli@@ m@@ kt@@ ors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ sm@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r can lead to a cur@@ ing of the Plas@@ ma level of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ alb@@ lock@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ an@@ pin , No@@ f@@ edi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin
the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase the plastic mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations and with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in connection @-@ side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , not@@ ions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g cur@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , around 86 % ab@@ san@@ k ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless that the possible use of a treatment that is the risk system@@ ic cor@@ tical cor@@ tis@@ ation of the effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ ce @-@ Hem@@ m@@ ons such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose coating reli@@ ve strongly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pr@@ ono@@ un@@ ced cre@@ ations of the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel in simultaneous operation of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
da Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ Enh@@ anc@@ ements of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ cog@@ ni@@ es can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ se , the combined application of this medicine with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
there will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabil@@ isation of the mirror as the plastic mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of Cy@@ clo@@ spor@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by Am@@ per@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) during the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ s@@ onic Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ s@@ onic Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ est@@ or@@ bit@@ ors to a possible increase in the plas@@ ma level of Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am around 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ her@@ ents should be compared with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monit@@ ored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ental symptoms , especially when dan@@ es even lower cans of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the per se low reliability of historic compar@@ is@@ ons can currently no recommendation is given , as the Am@@ per@@ av@@ ir@@ - D@@ osis is to adjust when Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous forkli@@ fts of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased inspection of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) due to the possibility of a dis@@ lev@@ elling or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional adoption of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contr@@ ac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predict@@ able to therefore also recommended alternative methods of contr@@ ac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amin and Nor@@ tic@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous for@@ e of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after a careful reduction of possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks to Fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk lak@@ tier@@ ing rats have been proven to Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ org@@ y is over@@ looked at people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;

the imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase was investig@@ ated with adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most of the effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated effects were easy to th@@ ink@@ able to im@@ posed early and led to a treatment .
&quot; in many of these events do not clari@@ fied , whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ lying disease . &quot;
most of the below side effects are from two clinical trials come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 30@@ 01 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) where patients were not treated with prot@@ ru@@ in patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were root@@ ed in connection with the examin@@ ations and in connection with the study of medi@@ ation , and with more than 1 % of patients re@@ vers@@ ed , as well as among the treatment of emerging laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy has been associated with an redi@@ stri@@ bution of the body perf@@ um@@ ton ( Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ y and fa@@ ther@@ al fat tissue , hyp@@ ert@@ ro@@ phy of the bre@@ asts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ al fat . &quot;

the proof of the eff@@ ic@@ acy of tremend@@ ous A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ author@@ ised studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in dos@@ es of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients were 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI un@@ treated patients previously had one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of ab@@ used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks the patients received a plas@@ ma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA @-@ concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 @-@ cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Bas@@ ement on this data should be considered in the treatment of treatment with PI un@@ treated children who are expected to be considered to be considered .
&quot; after an appointment , the middle duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule , and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % reduced , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the adoption of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of acceptance of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) of food intake un@@ influenced , although the simultaneous food intake the scale and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent volume volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and thus be a great deal volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r from the blo@@ od@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total @-@ centr@@ ation of the drug in Plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ anim@@ ated Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r that remains the active proportion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ anim@@ ated Am@@ per@@ rier is constant , pregn@@ ant the percentage of free active component during dos@@ ing inter@@ val in dependence on the total pharmaceu@@ ticals in ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;

&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r exposure to adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;

these liver tox@@ icity can be monit@@ ored in a clinical daily life by measuring A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine Pho@@ sp@@ hat@@ ase . &quot;

&quot; an dos@@ ing of charge for the simultaneous approval of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a narro@@ wer surveillance , as the effectiveness and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the Ex@@ position of both prot@@ ect@@ or@@ em@@ mer would be low .

&quot; in the study , mainly the security of pharmaceu@@ ticals was investig@@ ated , but it was also tested its effectiveness ( in terms of reducing G@@ ag concentr@@ ations in ur@@ ine and with regard to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag concentr@@ ations in the ur@@ ine around 60 % , and half of the treated children proved a normal large liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain , pain , ar@@ thro@@ sis , pain , pain , fe@@ ver , fe@@ ver , fe@@ ver and reactions at the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side @-@ effects for patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ der ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fe@@ ver and p@@ hers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who would possibly react strongly ( allergi@@ c ) on lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) are not applied .
&quot; the European Drug agency ( E@@ ME@@ A ) will each year all new information , which may possibly be known , check and update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients that Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be observed with regard to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
June 2003 the European Commission concluded by the G@@ enz@@ y@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for author@@ isation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ M@@ amm@@ alian @-@ cell@@ ars ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term grand@@ bed therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ co@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ ch@@ ari@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase @-@ lack ) index@@ ed to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other female metabolism .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased when the patient is carrying this to a maximum capacity of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and eff@@ ic@@ acy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established and for these patients may not be recommended for an explo@@ iting scheme .
the safety and eff@@ ic@@ acy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kid@@ ney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency is not determined and for these patients may not be recommended for a dos@@ ing scheme .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any associated with the inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion unit ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monit@@ ored by this patient , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment in the re@@ bel@@ tive facilities for medical emergency . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study is expected to make virtually all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who are developing anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion un@@ conditional reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience with regard to res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minim@@ ize the potential record @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , and / or reducing the inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate , when the reaction is occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of individual , heavy inf@@ usion un@@ conditional reaction must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too p@@ added . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usion can be recorded with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate , when the reaction is occurred . &quot;
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of an inter@@ ference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
&quot; animal experim@@ ental studies can not leave direct or in@@ direct harmful effects on pregnancy , the em@@ bry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ der over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the side @-@ side effects in clinical studies have been assigned mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions to be observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; un@@ wanted drugs relating to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3@@ - study and extension for a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often observed ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with heavy M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of upper breath@@ es and l@@ ungs in the history of history , even heavy reactions to , including bron@@ cho@@ sp@@ as@@ mus , breathing and faci@@ als ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted drugs relating to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy loads and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; with most patients there came within 3 months after the treatment of treatment for a ser@@ o@@ on@@ version , whereby it came to the patient at the age of 5 years with a heavy loads in the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase @-@ 3 @-@ study ( or up to a premature outputs out of the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients none by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ zo@@ cip@@ itation ( Rip ) Ass@@ ay re@@ vers@@ able anti@@ bodies , including 3 patients when it never came to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with regard to a lower anti@@ bodies form a robust reduction of the G@@ ag @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els in the res@@ n , while patients with high anti@@ bodies an variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 @-@ study and one in the phase @-@ 2 @-@ study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutral inhi@@ bit@@ al effect on enz@@ y@@ matic lar@@ gement activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to inter@@ fer@@ e the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not in connection with the inci@@ dence of un@@ wanted drugs , even though the appearance of un@@ wanted drugs typically typically created with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the reason for the En@@ z@@ ym@@ ology therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the ak@@ k@@ um@@ uli@@ ar sub@@ str@@ ate and prevent further acc@@ umulation of acc@@ umulation .
&quot; after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly taken away from the circulation and of cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ es , most likely about Man@@ n@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ pho@@ sph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been studied in a rand@@ om@@ ized , double flash@@ es , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ li@@ fied phase @-@ 3 @-@ study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were dependent on the middle phen@@ otype , and only a patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had an active exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end points for the effectiveness were the propor@@ tional change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - Ge@@ ht@@ est .
all patients were subsequently presented for an open @-@ label extension where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients to be treated compared to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of the lung function and con@@ duc@@ tivity , which is represented in the following table . &quot;
&quot; at the open extension , an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as shown in the table below . &quot;
the acceptance of the anticip@@ ated percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ atitis , on treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal living size . &quot;
within the first four weeks a marked di@@ arr@@ he@@ al of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ atin@@ in ) established until the study was constant .
&quot; with regard to het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous hospitals between patients who summar@@ ise by using a combined end @-@ level , the clin@@ ically significant changes ( compared to five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a det@@ eri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
it was a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients were investig@@ ated to the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe dis@@ connected form and 4 with the medium load @-@ form ) .
&quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased for increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the res@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks of 200 E / kg . &quot;
in several patients there was a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( N = 3 ) established after the Z @-@ Score for this age group . younger patients with severe dis@@ connected form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the medium dis@@ ser@@ ial form indicates a normal spiritual development speed on wo@@ ven with the elderly or even no progress in the cog@@ ni@@ tive development .
in a phase 4 @-@ study studies have been carried out investigations into pharma@@ co@@ odynam@@ ic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ es on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minutes ge@@ ht@@ est . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks can be used in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a reasonable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ es is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ ME@@ A ) will evaluate all new information , which is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharma@@ co@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile among patients at the age of 5 was similar to older and less strongly affected patients .

the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed slow@@ s the formation of the DNA and RNA and prev@@ ents that the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active shape goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of pharmaceu@@ ticals and a longer period of action in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ig@@ ar Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms was investig@@ ated A@@ lim@@ ta in a main student at 456 patients who had not received any chem@@ otherapy against their disease .

&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 cans of foli@@ c acid , and intake must be continued during the entire treatment of therapy , as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients also have to obtain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dosage , as well as after each third time cycle . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , should be created in front of each for@@ e a complete blo@@ c image , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ enz@@ l . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine Pho@@ sp@@ hat@@ ase ( AP ) , Asp@@ art@@ at Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limits . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle must take place under consider@@ ations - correction of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood or the maximum non @-@ ug@@ gage tox@@ icity of the preced@@ ing therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the information contained in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as Mon@@ otherapy or combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common To@@ x@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not @-@ ug@@ al tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( except the neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy has to inter@@ rupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient is the value before the treatment . &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 dos@@ ing reduction or non @-@ ug@@ gage tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occur or as - fort at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies would be no note that in patients at the age of 65 anniversary or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 is increased by elev@@ ated by means of elev@@ ated risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to incorrect data and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , in patients with a cre@@ atin@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment is necessary to go beyond for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
&quot; the data base in patients with a Kre@@ ator @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients have been diagnos@@ ed with a live functionality of &gt; dem 1.5 @-@ purchase of the upper bor@@ rowing machine and / or Trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ ic of the upper limits ( in Ab@@ out@@ - Wes@@ ness of Leb@@ er@@ metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ increments of the upper limits ( in existence of living metast@@ atic ) not specifically in the studies . &quot;

a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology and maximum non @-@ ug@@ gage tox@@ icity as they are observed in the preced@@ ing treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ug@@ al and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ aten when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients have to be referred to with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed patients to be explo@@ ited tort@@ ure and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ y@@ - lak@@ tical measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with easier to medium @-@ sized kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous action of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al Anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ a ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ o ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and mind@@ set of 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients when these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence of hyp@@ erten@@ sion or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - acc@@ umulation of the trans@@ cell@@ ular room a dra@@ inage of the result in the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arina , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally reported when this drug is usually achieved in combination with another Cypri@@ ot drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ised living @-@ poll@@ ut@@ ants ( except that vacc@@ ination is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a ir@@ rever@@ sible shepherd by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out of the treatment - g@@ inn , advice regarding the sperm . &quot;
in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can high cans of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al anti @-@ ph@@ yl@@ lic ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ amine in high dosage ( ≥ 1 g daily ) to a ver@@ ted P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with a result of a multip@@ lied up@@ setting of side effects .
therefore caution is offered when patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high cans of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ amine in high dosage are applied .

&quot; there is no data regarding the action potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fe@@ co@@ xi@@ b , the simultaneous use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoid@@ ed at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the great intra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the not@@ ation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between or@@ al anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chem@@ otherapy requires a higher detection frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ qu@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ er@@ ol@@ ites will be expected during a application in the pregnancy heavy birth @-@ def@@ ects . &quot;

Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
&quot; at chem@@ otherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , showed 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , over 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherapy , an un@@ solv@@ ent for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , showed 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) to 69 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;

da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ os@@ et@@ ron to be patient with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ho@@ ver@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ Ant@@ ag@@ onists is taking advantage of the ongoing forkli@@ fts of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medic@@ inal products , which is pro@@ long@@ ed or in patients when the Q@@ t@@ - inter@@ val is pro@@ long@@ ed or which can be extended to such a extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another Chem@@ istry @-@ Gab@@ e , Alo@@ xi should not be used in days after chem@@ otherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials inhi@@ bit Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , against tum@@ ors of five under@@ taking chemical therapeu@@ tics not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ pho@@ sp@@ ham@@ id , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical study there was no significant pharma@@ co@@ gene@@ tic interaction between a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .

in clinical studies were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ gram to wat@@ ched effects ( total 633 patients ) which at least possibly with alo@@ xi in the context of head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of exc@@ ess reaction and reactions at the passage ( burning , cur@@ ing , complaints and pain ) have been stated in post marketing manager . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequency of un@@ wanted events such as in other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dosage to observe relationships .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large proportion of di@@ aly@@ sis , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not likely be effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ ogen@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; in two rand@@ om@@ ized double @-@ blind studies have been received in total 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , with patients compared to the 32 mg On@@ dan@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;

results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the Indi@@ c@@ ation Chem@@ otherapy in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( CIN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the inv@@ ented investigation of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , the ability to block the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy pro@@ sec@@ uring the study conducted by the EC@@ G @-@ Eff@@ ect of i.@@ v. dir@@ ty pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single ho@@ ops from 0.25 to 0,@@ 75 and 2,25 mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption After in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Gab@@ e follows an initial settlement of Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations , a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average balance of half of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration of concentration time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally throughout the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ / kg at mess@@ es and cancer patients .
after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Gab@@ e from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es stood between day 1 and day 5 gem@@ ess@@ ed medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; from pharma@@ co@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations goes out that at once daily in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift from 0.25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to 3 consec@@ u@@ tive days reached by 0.3 mg . however , the C@@ max was compared to 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % will be elimin@@ ated via the kid@@ neys , and some more than 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abo@@ lic , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on met@@ abo@@ lic have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less measurement , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;

&quot; according to a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous bolt , the overall physical body 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients are increased with severe living dys@@ functions and the average systematic ex@@ position with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of dose is therefore non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies have been observed only to ex@@ positions that considered adequate over the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From the pre@@ clinical trials hin@@ ts that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be block@@ ed in very high concentr@@ ations , which can be involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action @-@ potential . &quot;

June 2006 the committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) a neg@@ atives report to be recommended in the temp@@ tation of approval for the in@@ corporation of the treatment of hep@@ atitis 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon of a biological medicines called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ tive effective element should be approved , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chr@@ onic ( long connected ) hep@@ atitis C ( one by vir@@ gin infection ) .

&quot; in the study to patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks , as well as 6 months after adjustment of treatment on drug languages ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and of the market medication have not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , who spoke on treatment with alph@@ eon and ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A an@@ chor , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon flame retard@@ ed the disease with more patients back to the reference agent ; also alph@@ eon has more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this in the study exam@@ ining the question pert@@ aining to the question , in@@ cum@@ ew@@ y the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body creates anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not suff@@ iciently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with Kru@@ sten@@ ing @-@ in@@ coming skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( Ris@@ ing or wr@@ aps ) , pick @-@ and non @-@ viol@@ ent wo@@ unds . &quot;
al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections that may be veri@@ fi@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections might not appear .
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may not exc@@ eed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking about two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient once more and alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block@@ i@@ als Ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of bacter@@ ial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ c@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was in all five studies the proportion of patients to dis@@ agree with the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients on plac@@ ebo spoke on treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alex@@ in similar contact : if the results of both studies were combined with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treat . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of waste ( ei@@ ter@@ ated hol@@ low spaces in the body tissue ) or of infections that were proven or probably due to MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most commonly referred to with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an ir@@ rit@@ ation of the client .
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) ar@@ ang@@ ed to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks are over@@ wei@@ gh : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small laz@@ ations , sh@@ aw@@ ns or gen@@ ates wo@@ unds . &quot;
May 2007 the European Commission concluded by the G@@ la@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the domestic market of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who shows within two to three days are not shown once again and has been considered to be considered aging therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of Sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or serious local ir@@ rit@@ ation by applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment is abandoned , the sal@@ be carefully wash@@ ed and an adequate alternative therapy of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treating infections where MR@@ SA is known as char@@ ger ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies under secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by an Meth@@ od @-@ resistant stack hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient . &quot;
an alternative treatment should be considered when after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no concern or det@@ eri@@ oration of the in@@ fic@@ ated place .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not tested and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations , which were achieved by people looking for top@@ ical application or in@@ ated super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous forkli@@ fts of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max by top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be placed on sec@@ uted skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systematic ex@@ position for top@@ ical application in patients will not be held accoun@@ table when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reaction tox@@ icity according to oral intake and are in@@ adequate regarding a statement on the birth and red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy only if a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacter@@ ial therapy is clearly indi@@ ces , and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to be prefer@@ able to a system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; when deci@@ ding if the breast@@ feeding is continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated , is between the benefit of breast for the m@@ amm@@ ers and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on 2150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most common reported of ir@@ rit@@ ation at the passage of the passage of approximately 1 % of the patients viewer . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used for protecting hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that are applied ) with children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of two dos@@ es existing vacc@@ ines whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may be reached only after approval of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is allowed only to be used while the immun@@ ization is low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is assured that the resulting from two dos@@ es will be guided to an end . &quot;
if a re@@ bel@@ lion against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis is given or -@@ B vaccine . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by bringing the immune system ( the natural absor@@ b@@ ent of the body ) , as it can live against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and created anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients such as the vaccine vaccine for Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine for 1997 approved for 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children in the frame of one of three dos@@ es existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the proportion of the mental children that had developed a month after the last inj@@ ection of anti@@ depres@@ sive anti@@ bodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine were compared with a hex@@ ag@@ onal zone and a 12 @-@ mon@@ ary distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led to between 98 and 100 % of the mental children a month after the last inj@@ ections for the development of protective anti@@ bodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix on a six @-@ six and at a 12 @-@ mon@@ ary distance between inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appe@@ tiz@@ ens , pain in the inj@@ uries , red@@ ness , mat@@ iness ( f@@ atigue ) as well as stim@@ ul@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react in patients who might be exc@@ essive ( all@@ erg@@ ically ) on the molecular entities , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) will not be applied . &quot;

&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two impor@@ ters , whereby the first dose of the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months is given after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ bel@@ lion is required for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ als vacc@@ ines or with a combination @-@ using fluid . &quot;
the according to a gr@@ di@@ m@@ mun@@ ization with the combinations of anti @-@ hep@@ atitis is anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ bodies are lying in the same size as according to the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ar vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons have talked to a Hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - Imp@@ act as protection , as they are also not proven with no longer veri@@ fi@@ able anti@@ bodies , as they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ ectors should be available for rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the Gab@@ e of the vaccine for appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and surveillance always available .
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended that the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ able hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis , and persons with disorders of immune system is achieved according to the prim@@ acy Anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ bodies , so that in these cases the for@@ e of other imp@@ lic@@ s can be required . &quot;

in clinical studies the 2029 impor@@ ters Ambi@@ rix on a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines in the age of 1 to including 15 years .
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 up to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination . &quot;
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ernity on a calculation basis per imp@@ ulse Ambi@@ rix but not on a calculation basis for per person .
&quot; pain was observed after the Gab@@ e of Ambi@@ rix at 50,@@ 7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of 3 dos@@ es combinations . &quot;

&quot; the frequency of mat@@ ernity was also comparable ( i.e. , compared with the whole vaccine cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the ambi@@ ent converted , compared with 36,@@ 2 % with the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ cans of using the 3 dos@@ es combinations ) . &quot;
the frequency pre@@ cau@@ tious pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable that after the adoption of the combination of combinations with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine has been observed .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study for 1- up to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actors and general re@@ actors in the ambi@@ tion with the 3 @-@ cans combination with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ able hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis is observed . &quot;
&quot; however , for the 6@@ - up to 11@@ - year , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ uries ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that have been using Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ able hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis @-@ B@@ - Surface Fin@@ ished was statisti@@ cally different .

&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was performed at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two dos@@ es Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined with three dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ity was consum@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against Hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after forkli@@ fts of 3 @-@ dos@@ es significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune answers , which were presented in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1- till 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after ending the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the emp@@ t@@ inge either received a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ able hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B surface .
&quot; among people , who were at the time of prim@@ ers between 12 and 15 years old , the persi@@ st@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be proven at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ination . &quot;

&quot; the Hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways such as bathing in through waste waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark Ur@@ in , a bl@@ ender face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms , which may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines can ambi@@ rix not fully protect against infection with hep@@ atitis , or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 dos@@ es . &quot;
if you are looking for your child before the adoption of both Imp@@ os@@ osen Ambi@@ rix is already infected with hep@@ atitis C virus or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you are not feeling un@@ comfortable or si@@ ck / feel ) an vacc@@ ination may not prevent disease .
a protection against other infections that are the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis or hep@@ atitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
&quot; • If you have already seen a allergi@@ c reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( a antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
an allergi@@ c reaction can be caused by ju@@ ice r@@ attle or the tongue . • if you have an allergi@@ c reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or Hep@@ atitis B . • if you have / your child have a heavy infection with fe@@ ver .
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the usually designated adoption of the second pulse dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you on your child from an vaccine with ambi@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis C @-@ vaccine with a r@@ alled sal@@ ary units of an form@@ al@@ in@@ able hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; the second impor@@ ters of this vaccine with decre@@ ased sal@@ ary to effective components usually reaches a month after the first dose , and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ines before termination of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix suffer from individuals who had to suffer from severe blood trou@@ bles , among the skin and not in the mus@@ cul@@ es . • If you are n@@ apped / your child due to a disease or a treatment in your / its body . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people may not be suff@@ iciently necessary to see so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 If you have received your doctor , if you have received your child further medicines ( including those that were you without en@@ roll@@ ment ) , or if you have received your child ( anti@@ static ) or im@@ m@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( si@@ RNA ) have been planned or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
but it can be that in this case the immune answer on the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be given to separate positions and as possible as possible as different li@@ mbs . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ ance at the same time or shortly before or after a inj@@ ections of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely to be suff@@ iciently that the reaction to the vaccine yet will be adequate . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregn@@ ant or breast@@ feeding women are not ad@@ minist@@ ered unless it is urg@@ ently needed to become mist@@ ak@@ ed against hep@@ atitis A as well as Hep@@ atitis B spirit@@ ually . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown a allergi@@ c reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on data , which have become known since the distribution of the first approval for the domestic use , the CH@@ MP was the view that the benefit risk of ambi@@ ance remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix was limited only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to its low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect or hyp@@ erten@@ sion .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps - split by several individual things to meals - s@@ lu@@ cks , under the food mixed or over a gast@@ ro@@ st@@ angle ( through the ab@@ dom@@ inal tube ) or a nas@@ al hose ( through the nose in the m@@ ages leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , as am@@ mon@@ aps cannot be compared with any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pse@@ medi@@ ation ament , i.e. without effect ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also have an appeal of appe@@ aran@@ ces in the blood , depres@@ sions , matur@@ ity , impot@@ ency , impot@@ ency , impot@@ ence , impot@@ ence , impot@@ ence , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , in@@ flamm@@ ation , im@@ pregn@@ ant , un@@ pleasant body or weight increase . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) ar@@ ang@@ ed to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high fish@@ ings are effective .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug . &quot;
the use is in all patients index@@ ed in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ et is already manifest@@ ed in the re @-@ born age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a del@@ ays form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life of life , if in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; for babies , for children who are not able to s@@ wal@@ low tablets or for patients with conclusion , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein @-@ toler@@ ances and for the growth and the development of the daily prot@@ ests of the patient .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose so@@ dium v@@ yl@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as with up @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of car@@ s.@@ pho@@ sph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ bub@@ ble , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or Arginine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with a non @-@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack must buy Arginine in a dosage of 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.6 g / m / day or 8.6 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be lab@@ elled to patients with hat@@ ching disorders that is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium in accordance with 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium for each 20 g so@@ dium v@@ yl@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum day dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be effective in patients with con@@ don@@ ated in@@ suff@@ iciency or serious kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with so@@ dium and o@@ dem@@ ic states only with caution .
da Met@@ abol@@ ization and secre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat about the liver and the kid@@ neys is done by AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in patients with liver or kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution .
the meaning of these results in terms of pregn@@ ant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high rate ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication , and to a dist@@ ur@@ red loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a del@@ ayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ ebr@@ al syn@@ ap@@ sen and a decre@@ ased number of functioning nervous person in the brain and thus a disability of the de@@ growth .
it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate when people fall into the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during shut@@ down . ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS entered at 56 % of patients at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events that they were not connected with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ chairs , peri@@ pher@@ y Neurop@@ ath@@ y and P@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis were developed . &quot;
a case of a brid@@ ge@@ ation occurred during a 5 month old small child with a vers@@ ed single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the acc@@ umulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at which showed for an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous approval of dos@@ es up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing limit@@ ing neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is an met@@ abo@@ lic active connection that is con@@ stitut@@ ed by ac@@ et@@ y@@ ging with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ alan@@ amin which will trigger over the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ alan@@ amin with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amin is therefore suitable as an alternative carri@@ ers to ex@@ cre@@ ased nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram obtained so@@ dium v@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gluten @-@ nit@@ rogen can be produced .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis and treatment is immediately started to improve the survival of the survival , and the clinical outcome . &quot;
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the early manifest@@ ation of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ lat@@ ed and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their stere@@ os@@ copic analogue within the first life year to death .
&quot; by Ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative secre@@ tion ( so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at ) , protein @-@ reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to diag@@ nose the exc@@ essive growth of post@@ part@@ al in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ state ) of diagnos@@ ed diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients , their disease has been diagnos@@ ed in the course of pregnancy and were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic@@ onic end@@ opathy , but even during these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a del@@ ays form of the disease ( including femin@@ ine patients with het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous en@@ han@@ dic@@ ine defic@@ iency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduction diet , was the exc@@ essive rate 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versi@@ bly and in some patients can occur another det@@ eri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical states .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ox@@ i@@ ded is ox@@ i@@ ded , which is created in Leb@@ er and kid@@ ney enz@@ y@@ matic with glut@@ amine con@@ jug@@ ated , whereby phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amin arises . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abo@@ lic in plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were determined after forkli@@ fts healthy adults and in patients with inter@@ ference of the ur@@ inary cy@@ linders as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of or@@ als from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abo@@ lic has also been investig@@ ated with cancer patients after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gifts of so@@ dium v@@ ard@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
according to a or@@ al individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium v@@ ard@@ yl@@ y@@ rat in tablet shape have been established 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plastic mak@@ in of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cir@@ cuits or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was after different dos@@ es Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) at the next morning after the next morning after the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at in plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; with three of six patients with liver circul@@ ating , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day of oral in three parts ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate con@@ centr@@ ations in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
the medication is within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amin over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests with tox@@ ic and non @-@ tox@@ ic cans with tox@@ ic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after the adoption of a single dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ul@@ at is taken either oral taken ( m@@ amm@@ ers and children , which are still not s@@ orted , or patients with hat@@ s@@ essive ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ st@@ angle or an nose . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose so@@ dium @-@ bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as with up @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , Arginine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ t chain amino acids ) , car@@ ni@@ tin and Ser@@ um@@ prot@@ ein in plas@@ ma should be kept inside the normal field . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of car@@ s.@@ pho@@ sph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ bub@@ ble , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or Arginine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium = 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium is equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium which corresponds to the maximum day dose .
when R@@ atten@@ u@@ ders were exposed before birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyram@@ id cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ chairs , peri@@ pher@@ y Neurop@@ ath@@ y and P@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis were developed . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ alan@@ amin with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amin is therefore suitable as an alternative carri@@ ers to ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ fication of over@@ shad@@ y
based on investigations on phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ alan@@ amin in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram is produced by 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gluten @-@ nit@@ rogen .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients can occur another det@@ eri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical states . &quot;
according to a or@@ al individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium v@@ ard@@ yl@@ y@@ rat in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form have been established 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plastic mak@@ in of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
during the duration of durability the patient can charge the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
&quot; with this procedure the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium v@@ yl@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication by a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can be dis@@ solved in water ( the solution from so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain Leb@@ er@@ enz@@ y@@ me , so that they are the stu@@ ds of oxygen in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are consult@@ ed with you , you must notify the doctor that you have AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as so@@ dium v@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratories . &quot;
&quot; when taking by AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines and have recently taken out of pres@@ cription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the still time you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since the medication may be over@@ throw in the mother &apos;s milk and could harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases have also been confusion , head@@ ache , flavors , desc@@ end of the hearing , dis@@ oriented , reminder and a det@@ eri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states . &quot;

&quot; Angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patient with &quot; &quot; mar@@ sh Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood vessels to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest with different strength ) or M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ g ( He@@ at ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ i@@ o@@ grams or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; Angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cells in patients who is intended to under@@ go one PCI , a higher dose , and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or the heart to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; appro@@ ached 14 000 patients participated in the main study about treatment of ACS , in which the effect of Angi@@ ox in all@@ some forkli@@ fts , or in connection with a gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine was compared with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ qu@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient was often used a stone ( a short tube , used in the ar@@ ter@@ ie to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cells , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was Angi@@ ox - with or without Gab@@ e from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , warmth or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year , just as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who was subj@@ ected to one PCI , Angi@@ ox in regards to all indicators just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy blood during which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
an@@ an@@ ox may not be used in patients who might be exc@@ essive ( all@@ erg@@ ically ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other shepherd or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients who had a con@@ gestion process , as well as people with rigi@@ d hyp@@ erten@@ sion or serious kid@@ ney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ it@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) ar@@ ang@@ ed to the conclusion that an@@ an@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ ot@@ able replacement for Hep@@ arin is .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission of the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd will provide a permit for the insurance of an@@ Angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with ak@@ ed cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ abil@@ e Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ market ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in a emergency access or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ ald@@ osis of Angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous bolt from 0,@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is performed a PCI for the patient , an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion can be increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after PCI can again be taken to a clinical coverage of up to 12 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg can be obtained , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ te@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initi@@ als in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one relates to immediately following in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bol@@ us Gab@@ e from Angi@@ ox has not been investig@@ ated and is not recommended if a short PCI procedure is planned .
is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on less than 225 seconds should be short@@ ened by 0.1 mg / kg / body weight .
&quot; in order to reduce the record lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicines prior to the application was carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis can be achieved rapidly in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate u@@ pright functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h &quot;
lies the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg to adopt and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ difficult cases , which led in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Studie ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which result@@ ed in phase III minutes after Gab@@ e of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion at average 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with heavy ro@@ uter ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also at di@@ aly@@ se@@ able patients is Angi@@ ox con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see below Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with Angi@@ ox can be created 30 minutes after the end of in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Gab@@ e of un@@ fr@@ action@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours following the termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gab@@ arin .
• Unknown hyp@@ ers@@ ensi@@ tivity to the drug or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • Active blood circulation or higher blood circulation system . • heavy anti @-@ bacter@@ ial end@@ ocr@@ ats ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ se@@ aled patients
patients are carefully monit@@ ored during treatment and signs of a blo@@ cking when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with other anti@@ qu@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if using PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most of the ble@@ eding products can occur in patients , which can occur in patients who appear to a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment basically throughout ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the war@@ far@@ in and be treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should ensure a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) in order to ensure that the value is achieved after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , prior to the treatment of existing levels . &quot;
&quot; depart@@ ing from the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ag@@ em@@ mer ) can increase of it that these agents increase the blood range . &quot;

&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in an Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn off the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus reducing the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regener@@ ates . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , juven@@ il@@ es and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with ins@@ ulin pen@@ s . &quot;
Ap@@ i@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a per@@ im@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is an ail@@ ment when the body does not have enough ins@@ ulin to control the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the In@@ ulin is not effective .
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very low @-@ class of human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it has faster and a shorter period of time has a short @-@ effective human . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is used in use in combination with a long @-@ effective In@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the body can not produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults , and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , Ap@@ i@@ dra was investig@@ ated in a study with 878 adults . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator of the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving children with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % ( of 7,@@ 60 % on 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin exp@@ ires pro . &quot;
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0,@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ i@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal standards . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra may not be used in patients with patients who are potenti@@ om@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against ins@@ ulin , or in patients who are already suffering from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ es of Ap@@ i@@ dra need to be adapted , if it is im@@ posed along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cos@@ ism . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission of the Company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Aven@@ tis Deutschland GmbH is a permit for the in@@ corporation of Ap@@ i@@ dra across the European Union .
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is considered sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections either in the field of pan@@ cre@@ atures , the thig@@ hs or del@@ to@@ ids , or stim@@ ulated by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of pan@@ cre@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; due to the r@@ amp@@ ed glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis , and of the ins@@ ulin ins@@ cription can be her@@ ed in patients with a restri@@ ction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effectiveness , the brand ( her@@ oes ) , of the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , n@@ ph , zin@@ k@@ ph , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal In@@ s@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change of ins@@ ulin @-@ form . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage , or the dem@@ oli@@ tion of a treatment , in particular in patients with a insul@@ ating diabetes , can lead to a Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin ; these states are potenti@@ ally life @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient on another ins@@ ulin @-@ type or an ins@@ ulin of a different vend@@ or should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
&quot; the time of occurr@@ ence of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the usage of the used ins@@ ulin , and can therefore change from the conversion of the treatment schem@@ es . &quot;
&quot; to the substances which can boost blood circulation and reduce incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , In@@ op@@ y@@ ram@@ id , Fi@@ br@@ ate @-@ Ox@@ id@@ ase , Pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hs , S@@ aliz@@ x@@ yp@@ hs , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide and antibiot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tica like Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pin the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ ater counter @-@ pressure due or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experim@@ ental studies showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ it@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the em@@ bry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the human mother &apos;s milk , however , in general , In@@ s@@ ulin does not enter into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it according to or@@ aler application . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials known according to those un@@ wanted drugs , group@@ ing according to the organs of their appearance ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( inci@@ dence on the availability of the ord@@ ba@@ - data is not estimated ) . &quot;

Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy Bl@@ d failed to jump the inj@@ uries inside the inj@@ uries at the inj@@ uries can occur in the result of a li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy at the injection site .
serious Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia with consci@@ ence can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is treated by one according to a trained person or by in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Gab@@ e by a doctor .
&quot; after a Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ ist project , the patient should be monit@@ ored in a hospital in order to determine the ur@@ el@@ .@@ stationary for the heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
In@@ s@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar by the stimulation of peri@@ pher@@ al glu@@ cos@@ ine ( especially by Sk@@ el@@ ett@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature and gre@@ ase ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glu@@ co@@ production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be carried out faster and shorter period is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - t@@ us showed in@@ sul@@ ational pressure range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more an optional increase in glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , exactly like human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast impact as normal human@@ ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data , it was clear that in an application of in@@ sul@@ em@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved such as human@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; En@@ sul@@ ek@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , became a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than with human nor@@ m@@ ins@@ ulin , which was made 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulate l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ emic control , such as human@@ istic gly@@ ca@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 mis@@ es before the meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at Gab@@ e 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal of the meal in comparison to human@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( graph 1@@ A ) , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( graph 1@@ B ) . &quot;
