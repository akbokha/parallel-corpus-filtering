<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate-severe episodes and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection-solution is used for rapid control of distorted disorder or behavioural dysfunctions if the orale intake of pharmaceuticals is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both illnesses you can use the solution to take or the melting tray for patients, the closing of tablets trouble."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who use other medicines, which are as shown as Abilify, the dosage should be adapted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of the nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol seems probably mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less measure than the neurotransmitter, to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder seems to play a role, the activity of the brain can reduce normative or manic symptoms, and their reoccur shall prevents."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the reoccur of symptoms, has been studied in three studies about up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in a further study conducted Abilify over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized to 160 patients when the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection-solution was used in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that is distorted by Lorazepam (a different antipsychotikum) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies the change of symptoms experienced by means of a standard skala for bipolar disorder, or the number of patients who studied at the treatment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in the two studies in the two studies showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant reduction of symptoms stopped as the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in application for treating the bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms are more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify's participation in addition to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the revival of manent episodes in previously treated patients and when it was in addition to existing treatment.</seg>

<seg id="24">"the most common side-effects of Abilify for use (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidals, Heathy (inflammation), storing, nausea (nausea), fatigue, nautical (nausea), fatigue, and exhaustion, rubenoness, Insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the committee for Humanities issued (CHMP) hed to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify for the treatment of schizophrenia and from Central to severe manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes had to overweigh the risks associated with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee on the result came to the outcome that the benefits of injectors solution in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disturbance, if a oral therapy is not suitable towards the risks."</seg>
