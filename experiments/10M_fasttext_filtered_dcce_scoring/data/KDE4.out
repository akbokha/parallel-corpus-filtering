&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated into place of the entire &amp; URL ; &quot;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish is in the best case a gro@@ om translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore the translation does not make any important decisions made available without the translation before .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translat@@ ing on the Bab@@ el@@ fish website even where you can add to translat@@ ing texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; capacit@@ or ; despite their low size they provide some extra functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by taking this easier .
further information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load settings extensions .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules .
&quot; this is a list of standard settings modules from the package K@@ DE ; Ad@@ d@@ ons . please note that any more modules installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
you should install the package deb@@ ase that includes &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
&quot; to use the cr@@ ash module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extracts . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the cr@@ ash , or the list of cr@@ ashes if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ u@@ filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras section . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M Buil@@ dings in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use extras DO@@ M @-@ tree and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : Docum@@ Element , all other knot@@ s are sub @-@ elements of this plant &apos;s root . &quot;
the &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type ino@@ es / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ bar and text messages to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of propor@@ tion@@ able folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . each object is propor@@ tional to its size . this size must be propor@@ tional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder than the sum of the size of the entries can be specified in this way . therefore , the size of a folder than the sum of the size of the entries can be easily recognized when they can be easily det@@ ected in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UN@@ IX ; -@@ Comm@@ ls you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ ble representation of a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for sim@@ pler navigation , the right area have useful colour control and compl@@ aint . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle which is swit@@ ched on the view color mode , can be either deep for the light detection of the fusion or the illustration of another file . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can set with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether they can be displayed at all , only if enough space is to be used at all ( with consequently , thus , the relative position allows you to specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; when drawing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should usually be observed that the area is propor@@ tional to the size of entry . at the Tre@@ plat@@ in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always available . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as the division of the area of a entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is carried out , remains the implementation of space and to avoid space requirements as well as to avoid space requirements that right square are to be as possible . the best methods of this respect are lines , columns or re@@ cur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal area for an entry on the menu item , but instead , a diamond pattern in the area of the public entry is signed to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an inter@@ section entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets thought it was developed for the application KC@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras @-@ gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

modern digital cameras are signed by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) and its der@@ iv@@ atives will also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its der@@ iv@@ atives . older cameras will also use the Serial Port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which was a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras suppor@@ st@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely known protocol which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to b@@ ills and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the ser@@ ial interface to communicate with the computer . since photos in general files are swit@@ ched and transmission through the ser@@ ial port slowly , this connection has now been swit@@ ched . &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found on this link . &quot;
li@@ bg@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ vest@@ if support to be reli@@ ably read by some li@@ bg@@ photo@@ 2 camera channels . if the Exif support is not available in li@@ bg@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support is not available in li@@ bg@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support is not available in li@@ bg@@ photo@@ 2 or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to provide . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to complement &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either move the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + change + F . &quot;
&quot; the move and drop of images everywhere , you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ m above the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only restri@@ ction is not in keywords , fil@@ en@@ sli@@ ste or search@@ es . &quot;
&quot; - a file type @-@ selection allows you to expand the most widely used : JP@@ EG , PNG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , Films and Audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields that can be displayed in the tool@@ box only if this ind it is also shown . which fields are displayed in the dialog box .

choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em ligh@@ ly added from the context menu . if you come back in &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; main window will open you to the lumin@@ ous fast with L Extr@@ as ligh@@ ly open .
&quot; from the pre@@ views , you can compare the pictures that you want to see in the left or right area of the window and put it there . if you perform preview out of the tool@@ bar and you can perform a lot or se@@ atic oper@@ ations at one of the pictures , then you can compare them in the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to use quickly from a picture series , then you will display the left mouse button on an arbit@@ r@@ ary picture in order to display it in the left @-@ hand side . this will be shown in the right area . this is simpli@@ fied it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal wages are also directly from the lumin@@ ance such as F@@ 4 file machining .... &quot;
all image information from the right page tool@@ bar of the main window are available for both pre@@ views in the lighthouse . this makes it e.g. simply visual differences with ventilation data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find an built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you recognise the visible area of the image , you must hold this ank@@ li@@ ons and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode , then both images are shown in the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ om@@ es works as well as in other views . simply use the Zoom controller under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad around into the image and out of zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital component management - apart from the process of the process , after the image has been made up to the fin@@ als issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos show , sc@@ ans or digital photos show a form of digital services . most of us do this , but not in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips as you can backup your pictures , please remove and convert photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photo@@ grap@@ her and digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; we are looking forward to convert , protect , protect , maintain , maintain , and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital @-@ Management takes on , index@@ es , categorized , search@@ es , search@@ ed , transformed , assembled , assembled , assembled , assembled , assembled , assembled , assembled , assembled , and export@@ ed content that a mon@@ et@@ arian or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata are defined according to your definition data , which provide information about or an documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I d@@ are to claim to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ adata to store very fast su@@ cking and a secure archi@@ ving to you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
the first thing you do and know before you have to maintain anything in your system . you have to decide whether other access to your photos are to be saved on your computer . you need to save it to a reser@@ voir drive or etc ; Be@@ watch it that you eventually need to switch to a bigger drive .
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday homes can be found quickly via your storage place , because you were staying in a year several times at the same place . if you do have enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , working enco@@ ding of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking process easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option Met@@ adata in the installation page of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; this makes sure that Ex@@ hi@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this represents a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attri@@ butes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work , since you should then choose any photo , as you should select all images that you need to select the same attri@@ bute and put the value then . you will start the best with the rating or the leader@@ board . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now with samp@@ ling , keywords as you continue with other programs often hot , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you are kat@@ alog@@ y pictures from a different source with built @-@ in keyword , then the tree came into the right place . the re@@ sort of Hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drawing of a sub @-@ tree . the changed keyword are being pursu@@ ed by &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; updated during it the sub@@ mit@@ es . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is cut off . this is a very large representation as each block of met@@ adata in truth from many sections . fil@@ ename and cal@@ ender@@ data are characteristics of all pictures .
&quot; enough of the keywords , the next section refers to compl@@ ying or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ing your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most anyone to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you see it closer , then catch it to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after land@@ ing . Wow ! one begins to dream , association , you might even hear the silence . the let@@ ter@@ ing has changed completely your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for other who see your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the image itself . if you show images you should tell a story about how to help him about the mot@@ if you are moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when a picture is not perfect , when the strength has only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; you can export your images in Web galleries , then you can even export them for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE , you can even export them for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE , you &apos;ll have to export your images in Web galleries . you need to tell you the story so for the opening period no second time . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you go into another city without navigation system ? it was earth not a boring planet prior to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Earth ? good because with pictures goes on the train of sp@@ atial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to increase Geol@@ ocation are already in@@ concei@@ v@@ able and will be sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travel files with geographical information . this can also be k@@ ml files you can also export at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . with the Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Maps @-@ Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; copy@@ left is a voc@@ ative with copyright and identi@@ fies the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description says you what information in the Settings page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( Syn@@ onym for Adults and authors ) : this field should protect your name , or use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organisation , it should not be changed . this field does not support com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title ( Syn@@ onym for editor ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work design@@ ation of the photographer . examples of this can be the photographer . examples of this can be the photographer , freel@@ ance photograph or Independent photographer . since this is an inheritance to the author , it must be filled this as well . &quot;
&quot; Editor ( Syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider &apos;s provider to identify the photo . if the photographer has been listed here . if the photographer has been listed here . if the image is an image photo , then the group / agency will be specified here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . each of the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is only for the majority of your photos only by little interest . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is per picture unique . &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed in the near future there is such a module for st@@ acking processing .
&quot; topics : error , turn@@ out , electricity poles , EC@@ C , Transi@@ tion , restoration , red@@ und@@ ancy , des@@ patch , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ation , li@@ fest@@ y@@ age , temperature , data size , common Aber@@ deen &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that went on the road or a fire . this kind of loss is the same that you can also happen in traditional paper photos , or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the biggest data recover@@ ed company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem at CDs / DVDs to fight these pre @-@ sight@@ ed and one can keep you longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ ving DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece is worth a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you think that is in your in@@ meas@@ ur@@ able space . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good performances . the best DVD records are not much more expensive than the cheapest properties , but you write much lost . it therefore turns right to choose the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are highly vulner@@ able for mistakes , even if you have just been written for mistakes . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting and the check@@ sum@@ s . despite this massive protective system they need by chemical ag@@ eing , ultr@@ avi@@ ol@@ ettes light , scr@@ atch , dust , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged dis@@ ks , HD@@ Ds , Fl@@ ash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
Op@@ tical media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ ks seem to store the form@@ ul@@ atory war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all things to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
&quot; burn slowly with a good absor@@ ption of high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . Read the data on a clean , dar@@ ker dri@@ es , and in front of animals protected site . do not forget the data to read the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
Disk@@ manufacturer will retain your statistics for itself . your manufacturer &apos;s guarantee includes a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field of dis@@ ks about the error mechanisms of hard dis@@ ks .
&quot; in brief : dis@@ ks hold off at the lon@@ gest temperature of 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the most frequent bug@@ fixes , S@@ MAR@@ T can not determine this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T does not determine this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T does not determine this error . these are in particular reading and publ@@ ishers . the expected life @-@ time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete se@@ aled due to over@@ tension . of course , you can also have data recover@@ ing due to a current time before you have back@@ ed the files , but these losses can usually be elimin@@ ated without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices sets not much out , it looks different from devices with computer chips and high speed processes , complete data loss , destruction , destroyed mother@@ boards and other def@@ ects . protect yourself from the in@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against electricity supplies is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of energy supply absor@@ bs , and the rest assured . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . do you think that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a pre@@ volt@@ ages , then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also consider it to protect the protection against flash and thus protects the correct devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can use each cable to your computer , you should be sure that all peri@@ pher@@ als can be connected to your system . others also provide a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others provide connection possibilities for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of cable gland and TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will require a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . so you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system is protected from smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a drop of few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ authorized data . it may therefore be useful to invest up @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ volt@@ ages , these devices automatically occurs cor@@ dless energy . this gives you the possibility to store your data and running the system . if you need a US@@ V then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the present software is interesting . &quot;
concerns the potential risk that is exposed to your b@@ ent system and compare your safety when you think about it . this is just a small price level when you think it is just a small price level when you think it is just a small price . this is just a small price level if you think about how good your computer can protect it . at the end you should always think all the cable before you go into the holidays .
&quot; Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer to store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; they are at home compared to the hard dis@@ ks at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB expenses &amp; dollar ; in addition , you must send the data over the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution but it is not a general security solution . it is too slow .
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q.com is available on photos . your free store is not available in full resolution . the professional variant will not be available to you in case of fli@@ ck@@ r dram@@ atically more . for 25 $ per year you will get in@@ limited storage , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the Web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission is automatically clean@@ ed and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . therefore they are Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmission are due to exc@@ use error . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integr@@ ability between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst of it is that you no one says if an exc@@ essive error occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ reported in your computer . nobody seems to have thought it in your computer . nobody seems to have thought it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much saf@@ er way than those in your computer .
&quot; Un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission , as they generate inter@@ ference within the data stream . at normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with turn@@ outs on lower level and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . Read this article in English .
oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still used in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protective mechanisms of the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the core .
do this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data exchange with the not@@ ebook and 46 % with the work@@ top systems . in Not@@ ebooks is the proportion of the theft .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most popular , e.g. Di@@ eb@@ st@@ äh@@ le or Neu@@ install@@ ations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple user only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer any more sight@@ ed . &quot;
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data recover@@ ed as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than EX@@ T3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS and XF@@ S to call the most common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a su@@ dden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an in@@ defined status will be avoid@@ ed before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main sense of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blocks of fundamental physical bound@@ aries . shared that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and car@@ v@@ ings for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution has more det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras and the end result is the optimum size of 6 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resol@@ utions you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk can be held today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , you are responsible for any other data base . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a backup and test this backup before you are anything more dangerous such as the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of hard dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; sup@@ pose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash f@@ ails have luck if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a des@@ aster sugge@@ sts locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ condition : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ den@@ ung always means a non local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stair@@ way up , into the neighbor@@ ing house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for a backup , despite sec@@ uring the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be guaranteed . it is a snap@@ shot of all files without the history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last finish . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time @-@ points : the complete backup , and the last difference . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next time with the exception that it is only down@@ stock and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer@@ able scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files really changed . this happens un@@ comp@@ ressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h . &quot;
ensure important pictures directly after you are stored on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this procedure lets you discover enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moments for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ adata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , recover@@ ing images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , refl@@ ections , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; to make valuable pictures the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you , because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future due to your nature is un@@ predict@@ able , you need to view and new rate all over time . unfortunately , there are no other option to be compatible with caution . unfortunately , there are no other option to be back@@ ward with caution . the less variations are used in the past . the less variations are used in the past , so much easier to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered as using the explanations in this document . use and switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is nowadays for any available . if you have an old system to read your images , then keep it on and install it on a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup data , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay at open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the pres@@ sures for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always true .
let &apos;s go out of that you have planned the scal@@ ability with entry and the area you want to enlarge a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new plate :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record is det@@ ected from the system , but hang it not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / sd@@ b &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / sd@@ c # source is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ T ; # works with ext@@ 2,@@ 3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Rei@@ ser@@ FS &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad c@@ 1 # changing the size of Rei@@ ser@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can be read , then you can create it . this task is easier for year to year . &quot;
&quot; gif is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you therefore should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG transparent as an open source standard developed by GI@@ F . it can store C@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata for an improved color instruction on het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a slow comp@@ ression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as image size . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed shape or in a container with a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free comp@@ res@@ sion@@ ism ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . there is a problem that this format is adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and comm@@ its for the use of met@@ adata . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and we hope to use the competit@@ or Canon and Nikon it also some@@ time .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in order to re@@ placing the &amp; quot ; Bild@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ml@@ quot ; stored that for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographer draw it to an original your recep@@ t@@ acle , mostly in the raw format , too archi@@ ving . X@@ MP can be stored separately from the image file , and how we are already registered with the link between the met@@ adata . therefore , you should decide whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models to work for a wide range of applications and business models , discussions and shared work in the DC@@ MI communities and the DC@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard , and clari@@ fied efforts to achieve a wide @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera r@@ amedi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
Convert hard@@ files to DN@@ G and save them in your Ro@@ har@@ chi@@ v . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a hos@@ tile editing you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; digi@@ pack ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under circumstances by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the be@@ edited paintings for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ erien , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print you &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can get a description of how to add photos , you can already add photos to your hard drive . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your screen . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , connect them with the computer , turn the camera on the display and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is produced , a fer@@ er -@@ Indi@@ c@@ ator will appear at the bottom of the bottom and the Thumbnails of all photos on the camera . some cameras will be displayed , the fil@@ ename and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the si@@ deb@@ it features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an item or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file properties and photo information , which are stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras will not be available all information . &quot;
&quot; the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata like a , manufacturer , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata are not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on button Download and then the selection of all download . this loads all photos of their camera into a single record and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safe to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the photos selected by the default methods of &amp; K@@ DE . once you have selected the photos , use the button . the button for download it is as long as aus@@ ed until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this is an option of new download . these pictures were not downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in advance . if you choose this option , of course , the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All to download or Selected as a dialog box , with which you can choose the target album , shown in the photos of the existing albums , shown in the section called My albums . select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete them all at once . if you don &apos;t want to delete them , so you need to select this first and remove it from it . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no way there are photos that you get deleted from the camera . if you have been completely deleted . you should carefully check if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ tization . if you do not want to delete them from the camera . if you do not want to delete the camera image , since this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly mean@@ ing@@ ful names . the fil@@ ename will usually load again , if you were able to double pictures from the camera . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time , to which the image was made to be integrated in the fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for the rot@@ ate and Spi@@ eg@@ les of the picture and for dat@@ ic@@ based under@@ carriage . if you use this latter option , automatically a folder per day is created . &quot;
the options Wh@@ ile the transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the photos stored on the plate . the first two concern the data about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images .
&quot; if you want a different data format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ ename , you have the opportunity to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in case letters if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; for a photo is used under the name , the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used , if you can open the next time the camera . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera on the timeline . not all cameras put this information ready . in the page row Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not delivers , leaves &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button in the bottom area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is made available on the date , where the photo has been made available to download &amp; digi@@ tization . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same album . all pictures with the same date will be available in the same signature . all the cameras will be available in the same signature . all the cameras will be available . in the section page row Meta @-@ data you can read , which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually out@@ dated , and in this case , you want to change the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button on the button at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to load photos from their machine to load their camera is the kno@@ b . select dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears in which you can select the files you need to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
&quot; after the brightness is finished , as@@ ks &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; you when the pictures will be loaded up . select a folder dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and click OK to upload the uplo@@ ading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position shared which can be specified in long@@ it@@ ude and lati@@ tude . thus the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS to the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photo@@ graphic it may be interesting to link an image with a pre@@ precision geographical location . not everyone is used to link an area by automatic recording of the GPS @-@ data protection , military , police , architecture offices , and are used to use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can select a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; users wish to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; users wish to loc@@ alize the place of photos therefore , it is good to document the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS @-@ data into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields are supported . the question is actually more , such as the data contained in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the use of GPS @-@ data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera who has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recipi@@ ents together . either as a card module , or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ bab@@ el . you need to store these data in the g@@ px format because this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ it@@ ude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters to be created by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; try to give you a lot of control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many at@@ titudes to select the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; change in the menu settings digi@@ tization . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; select action can display in embedded preview or start editing process . you put the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and b@@ ite data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also with a database synchroni@@ zation , these data is written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for dis@@ comfort : this field should be the professional design@@ ation of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations like e.g. an@@ ter photographer , freel@@ ance photograph or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description to the car field , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; Editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to use the photo as such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus the met@@ adata will permanently include in the image and can not only be used in the database of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; and these met@@ adata are available to other programs and can be import@@ ed in &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; and to be import@@ ed without lost .
&quot; cap@@ tions as a built @-@ led cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images , this synchroni@@ zes the comments that you can have read to your photos , with the pictures included in pictures , which were already written by the images , which were already written by the images of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the site settings contains all options for the information , which appear if the mouse po@@ inter in the main window via a file rests . depending on the selected option will display this information or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; supports a number of different images and video formats ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; display that you can add file extension to this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner who has none of these extensions ; ignored by &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; ignored .
the standard settings can be back again by clicking the button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse of &amp; digi@@ ous ; can then be inser@@ ted on this page to the standard values . however , you can then use the ligh@@ thous@@ es . however , you can only use different sizes and the syn@@ chr@@ onic mode . if you have a fast b@@ ills . if you have one , then you can obtain better results of results . &quot;
&quot; default , the image processing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full training mode . &quot;
Over@@ - and under@@ ed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or h@@ ager color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing can be specified here . in the image processing can be swit@@ ched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Subs@@ amp@@ ling is meant that the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance can be obtained in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance , please read this article in Wikipedia to the immediate explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting PNG @-@ comp@@ ressing , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not require the image quality , because PNG transparent machine , since you have a fast computer you can put this value to a high comp@@ ression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression . &quot;
with the T@@ IF@@ F files comp@@ ress you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m .
&quot; with the setting loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can hide it freely . even if you have written the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ alled setting , the relationship between quality and file is written far better than in the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers , the image editing only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default end is that all green pixels equal to the CCD @-@ Sens@@ ors with sensitive light in the output . if you use this option a little soft spot in the output . if you use this option a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gr@@ illing patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality methods . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ ening of the camera is used . otherwise if the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only when the whit@@ ening is not set . default , it is a fixed color balance that is photograph@@ ed on a white card which is photograph@@ ed in the sun@@ light photograph@@ ed , based . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the Ben@@ der of the second sensors has the effect that supp@@ ered images in four steps more details in the top @-@ way . for other cameras will be ignored this option .
&quot; the standard is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your images are recover@@ ed , due to the in@@ duc@@ tivity of your camera is created , because they can see the most sophisticated white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the re@@ curr@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , since blue pixels generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try the lack of green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option , you get the option to set up a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture separately . &quot;
&quot; Set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ worth to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the Standard 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go conserv@@ ative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to det@@ ect a complete picture from the parti@@ cles data that provides many cameras and the one matrix colored pixel available . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or far@@ ming .
&amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; and D@@ cra@@ w represent you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of G@@ radi@@ os ) was the first algorith@@ m of D@@ cra@@ w ( variable number of G@@ radi@@ os ) was interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can get the red and blue cor@@ rec@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a dy@@ ing correction , since you performed during the raw converter . &quot;
a profile translated the color form@@ ations and gives instructions how this should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tis@@ es ; information such as the color form@@ ations of a Far@@ br@@ aum in the others are thus possible to translate the colors as accur@@ ately as possible .
&quot; conduct questions , if a picture is open in the image processing / colour management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; colour profile folder button here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .co@@ chlor@@ ine / ic@@ c , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed , and investig@@ ates this folder then during the Star@@ ts . &quot;
settings of the IC@@ C profiles you have here the possibility to store &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ared ; for your profiles to store . everything can change in opening the raw file later .
the colour scheme is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures of colored not the whole screen .
&quot; the entry profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are included on the same type . currently , there are no colour ton@@ m@@ apping or gam@@ mak@@ es@@ y . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma do not need for con@@ versions at 16 bit deep . this means that you have to perform the Col@@ ton@@ m@@ apping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can stim@@ ulate how your image has been able to print picture as your camera and some colours can therefore be very saturated . this could be correct@@ ed manually , rather than on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite apparent which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is natural in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon type extension can be recognized in the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for portraits , P for portraits , and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; pictures and image of modules were supported ; many modules were written to support with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I module , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers . this module will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and in addition , you can also find some also in the context menu . &quot;
short @-@ run for tasks that are performed by modules can be set by modules in the menu under Settings menu .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller is easy to understand the time between the image , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other pres@@ enter fields are switching the met@@ adata that are acquired during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to make use that the camera is connected , swit@@ ched and in the Bil@@ th@@ zei@@ o@@ dus . currently there are Serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or I @-@ Link ) . you have to select a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire club camera from the camera . you must indicate the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , where you specify your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , you must connect the camera with your computer to put them into the display and switch . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers came automatically ; if not , you can set camera dell and port manual . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation of dialog for the rel@@ ocation of &gt; pictures in the du@@ ke , you can set out the talk of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; during the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo album in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you can find further details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right page bar can be silent through &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; if you use the option changes in the right page row without queries . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button to use the button . &quot;
you can also under@@ go the indication of the welcome package of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; this acceler@@ ates under circumstances the starting point of &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers .
setting Bei@@ m Start to look for new photos &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed albums / fotos came to search for new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the basic ord@@ ner was deleted . if something from the basic folder was asked ; you if it should delete it from the database .
various colour schem@@ es can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be chosen under Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be found below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ pack came ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these photos to view and correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers . they are therefore not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section Imaging editing .
&quot; status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current dates number , larger fil@@ ing factor , and the current bri@@ an@@ ist shows . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the processing functions of the image processing changes your photos . no of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saving or the kno@@ b saving out of the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer re@@ produce the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should therefore possibly have a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with file .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the button to restore the button . you then lose any change that you have performed on the photo since last update . &quot;
almost any action of the image processing can be re@@ vers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be re@@ activated or restored by making sure you will select res@@ ign@@ s from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to re @-@ consum@@ ed and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ re@@ ty @-@ Z to re @-@ restore . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the resi@@ dual or recover button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will select a context menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also res@@ id@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can use the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar picture high , image below or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to store them . &quot;
you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge : enlarge &quot;
view full screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ mode . you will also use the tool@@ bar button . if you don &apos;t want to change this in the imagination dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; change this can be found out of the game dialog box ; main window will be able to view the section for editing of image processing .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print in the menu picture and get the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; press dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can select single images or all the pro@@ positions . the picture gallery can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ters . if you follow the wizard , you will only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; main window has a page bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for selected images . the same page bar is available without the navig@@ ational parts , even if one of the five tab is displayed : &quot;
click on the same rider can appear the si@@ deb@@ m or disappear in the edge .
&quot; in the compl@@ aint , you can insert compl@@ aint with unlimited size or insert . note that all special signs are permitted . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are shown on 2000 characters . all comments are tr@@ unc@@ ated to 2000 characters and special characters will be re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC cap@@ tures in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after which you have commented , you will either use the button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the use buttons , there is a kno@@ b . with this you can read more met@@ adata from selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ adata in the files you will always have chosen a met@@ adata settings that is always written into the pictures . &quot;
the section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and Sorrento . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the page row or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the si@@ deb@@ ar will be used to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows this diagram in the following table :
&quot; the liter@@ al view shows a search box to the filters of the keyword , the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; -@@ session im@@ pregn@@ ated samp@@ ling . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search engine . you can easily limit the number of options in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom of the end is another relief in the input of keyword at a picture series . if you have inser@@ ted various keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ings of the appropriate an@@ arch@@ ery in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view , and you will find a keyword in the keyword picture and not applied to the whole selection , if you want to send a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword . &quot;
&quot; the si@@ deb@@ tor keyword is used to change the selection of the main window shown pictures . usually , the left page row can be used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search@@ es , only the inter@@ vals of these two are displayed , only the wr@@ aps of these two are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and put them . sup@@ pose you have selected in the main view several pictures to disp@@ ers@@ . if the keyword has already exist , you can simply put it out of the right page row and draw up a dialog box if you want to place the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures at a cal@@ ender tag . they have been reduced by Str@@ g + a . they were drawn with str@@ g + a . they were asked to select a keyword from the right to the right . a dialog as@@ ks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place in every start of the program . it can also be swit@@ ched under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that there is one or be , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database was sought . this may be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string chain , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you may use e.g. an extended search across all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the app@@ enn@@ field at the end of the rule and then use the button . the options see then as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space location is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly to &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one sets a colored workflow , the colors available from your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ ful workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner and that the colours you can print or publish them on the web sites from your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes to colour management , then everyone wants to express what buttons it needs to provide information for the results . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate information about color management . additionally , you will receive links with deeper information to make your own inform@@ ational decision to make you the desired result . &quot;
if your cap@@ tion has met all the six listed below then you will not have to take care of colour management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
your only other cap@@ tions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB so good works and life for all so easy to do , why you should then use another color space and have to worry about sh@@ aman@@ ic control ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hu@@ is@@ sen@@ ess region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular area . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger Far@@ br@@ aces so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms ann@@ ente page and then click on info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to det@@ ect my monitor if I have decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum , since s@@ R@@ GB thereof you need to raise your monitor . if you work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , then you need to use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a matching monitors . &quot;

&quot; norm@@ alize , this method scal@@ ed the lumin@@ ous point on the entire picture , so the dark point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without its sh@@ avers . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures the dark or out @-@ wash . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , this method j@@ us@@ ed the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image so as flat as possible . therefore , the same very good results in improving the contr@@ ast@@ ation of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation that works either mir@@ acle in an image or it destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ iz@@ es the color range in the red , green and blue @-@ sh@@ ades , and j@@ us@@ ed the rot@@ tle @-@ t@@ ints , and j@@ us@@ ed the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ int on the complete hist@@ og@@ ram area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ os@@ ity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the low@@ est and highest values on the biggest area and a re@@ ji@@ b of all values in between images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ equal from &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whit@@ ening of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited because of a far@@ br@@ aum with 8 @-@ bit can occur . if you can work too far from the original image , which will perform the white wall in the raw mode , which are in the 16 @-@ bit mode so your ways to correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white gradu@@ al algorithms , the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m is protected . they run it via the menu internal colors of white trans@@ forms of image processing . &quot;
the pre @-@ gr@@ ading can be adapted in the size . on the left side you can see dynam@@ ically adapted the settings of the tool . if you want to watch dynam@@ ically the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original or click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos features a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the Hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; right above a Hist@@ og@@ ram displayed that dynam@@ ically , once you have a parameter to change . this hist@@ og@@ ram you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shad@@ ows lets you improve the Sch@@ att@@ end@@ et@@ ails to improve your photos or also down di@@ mming . &quot;
&quot; check@@ out with the above controls around you , you should use the color temperature of Pi@@ p@@ ette . press the images to use the colour temperature of the white wall . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white list with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the d@@ ressing Indi@@ c@@ ator increases the colors if more than a colour can@@ al of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white screen . this is shown in the preview as a pure indic@@ ator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons save as well as loading exactly this . every setting of the white memory you can set up into a text file and back later .
&quot; the kno@@ b pre@@ cep@@ tions , all the filter values are back on their standard values and the associated neutr@@ als . note that even neutral settings will be a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set here the enco@@ ding letters per colour can@@ al of the be@@ amed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is also suitable for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding requires better for high @-@ quality photos . this enco@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality photos , PN@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of colour profiles . it uses the change and assignment of colour profil@@ ing . colour tone can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness of the brightness , you can drag the chapter color management at rate . &quot;
another important tool is available in the menu under colours sound correction ability . this tool provides an integrated way to save several colour channels and allows you to use it for multiple photos . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner will always allow the same error . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct loading problems is the tool to the Grad@@ ation that you can find under colors Grad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ects provides you four colour @-@ effects , a solar cable , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ ization , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the origin@@ ate . this had the effect that the bright@@ er areas dar@@ ker and the colors used by the second lighting inver@@ ted . the result was a part of the image . this tool allows you to move this interesting effect . &quot;
the int@@ ensity controls the solar ization . at about 50 % int@@ ensity displays the image which is possible . an additional increase generated by neg@@ ativity that so does not create on photo@@ copy .
this is an example of solar @-@ operation . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edit the ( 2 ) . the integer int@@ ensity is at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter is sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger double @-@ effect . try it easy and spar@@ kl@@ ing many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for one on the daylight of the Japanese company F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its g@@ lat@@ te image structure . Vel@@ vet offers him the movie of choice for natural photo@@ graphic . Vel@@ vet offers him some photo@@ graphic palette , especially those who are hardly any landscapes . &quot;
the Ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ mu@@ stered ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and sli@@ ding repeti@@ tions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
&quot; digital cameras have a lot of problems with light conditions , and it is therefore not unusual that you can correct the colors of your photos with the tools shown in the menu under colors . as soon as you are happy with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you get a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the converted problem : one too large satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation reduce a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation . if you can perform the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / contrast , tool is very complicated . even if the dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the area of sli@@ der . specifically the three sli@@ ders below the Hist@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of int@@ ensity , a hist@@ og@@ ram , of active Can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ ders to change into the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to learn how to learn it is the controller to shift and consider it as the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and the preview of the picture will be considered . the preview is dynam@@ ically , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this type box can be set whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a lin@@ ear@@ piece or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix Y @-@ axis is often represented . for images of a digital camera is often dominated the linear Hist@@ og@@ ram of a single column . in this case the logical hist@@ og@@ ram will be dominated by a single column . in this case the logical Hist@@ og@@ ram will be useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ator : the top for the dark sh@@ ades , the middle for the bright sh@@ ades , and the low@@ est for the middle ton@@ es , often gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three sh@@ are@@ pet@@ pet@@ ten can be used in the preview of the original image to be used in the shadow , middle and bright t@@ ints automatically . moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output rating : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used for example . the comp@@ ression of the output values can be used e.g. for example to create an adequate picture as a background while creating something else in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the int@@ ensity of the image .
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can store the values in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later re@@ loading the Gim@@ p levels format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three sh@@ ades , the inputs are automatically re@@ generated for all shad@@ ows , means and sun @-@ t@@ ints , and click on the preview of the original image for rot@@ - , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channels . &quot;
&quot; the option brid@@ ging indic@@ ator controls all the colour channels to be over@@ loaded pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is a indic@@ ator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect in the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the Red , Green and Blue Channel of a photos . int@@ ensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original , and the target picture shown . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification channel : this type box allows the channel to specify the channel is changing from the module :
&quot; besides this cas@@ ket , two symbols are recorded between a lin@@ ear@@ en and a logis@@ tic view . for pictures that generated with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode created a wide Bal@@ ken . in this case helps the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ous mode continues . &quot;
&quot; if you want to move a curve to the right , for example the bright ton@@ es , then you can see that these bright ton@@ es with dark bas@@ kets and the corresponding image pixel . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings to the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it to and from , until the value after your taste is j@@ us@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can accur@@ ately do this . every curve that you created you can store in file system and later be loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this method and the three sh@@ pi@@ pet@@ pet@@ ten buttons automatically create the control points of curve , middle and sun@@ sh@@ ades . activate the color pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the rot@@ - , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ aire curve . &quot;
&quot; the option brid@@ ging indic@@ ator controls all the colour channels to be over@@ loaded pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here it is a indic@@ ator , so you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see an black @-@ white picture that was correct@@ ed in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . Sch@@ atten@@ - and sun @-@ t@@ ints was set with colour pip@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the cycl@@ ist : image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the sh@@ ades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another high @-@ developing tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it out of the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel type box you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram , this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and output . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab . &quot;
the preview of the target group has a red mark@@ er . if you put this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate colour value .
&quot; controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also enable the general brightness , even if you can also reduce the option Mon@@ och@@ rom , since you can also reduce the option Mon@@ och@@ rom , since you can also reduce the option Mon@@ och@@ rom . try to reduce the Grün@@ can@@ al for Black @-@ White Portra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color does not appear at the same point in the shade of colour and their smo@@ other patterns in each channel is different . if the case you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rom &apos;s conversion , allowing you to reduce the far@@ mer &apos;s first . &quot;
the save as and loading buttons are exactly used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can thus save it for later and then load . the file format is the Gim@@ p channel @-@ mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option brid@@ ging indic@@ ator controls all the colour channels to be over@@ loaded pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is a indic@@ ator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ activated . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and that worked image below ( 2 ) .
black / White @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working steps that can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white filtration filter . this looks good for portraits against the sky and fits particularly well for portraits against the sky . thus similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white filtration filter with a or@@ angen par@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and avi@@ ation . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange @-@ filter . &quot;
rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ ing filter with a red lin@@ sen@@ er . this creates dramatic direction and can sim@@ pler to the day @-@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ ing filter with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ er . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : gener@@ ates warm bright and medium ton@@ es while he added a bit of cold in the she@@ ath . this is quite similar to the process of expression of a dru@@ mmer and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and with it similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; tool tex@@ ture use you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on one picture .
&quot; by adding a tex@@ ture to your image , regardless of whether there is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil wr@@ apping on a canvas , the bul@@ lock of an old master , a Pop Art portrait of enlarged points or just like a wall picture on a wall . the menu picture can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the deep or three @-@ dimensional of tex@@ ture on the picture .
a paper text message has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . parameters Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; tool frame can add a decorative frame around a picture .
&quot; the eye of a vie@@ wers in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to add a decorative frame . this is a psych@@ ological bar@@ rier for the stre@@ aming eye . under picture frame can be started out of image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , you provide the desired circuit type for your image . continuous operation with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce round@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , it is ideal for a button @-@ shaped and decor@@ ative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of frame in percent . value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; that with the frame dec@@ eas@@ ed destination will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after shi@@ pping@@ ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ att@@ ed text into a picture at any stage . this is also available in multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to users . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . you will need to adjust the character size , the bigger the character size , the larger needs to be a frame around the text and / or half a half @-@ back background . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text , can be modified until you are stored on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture is stored , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; tool St@@ en@@ one can apply you a template over one image .
the menu picture St@@ en@@ one use in the image processing can be used to put Stencils over one picture .
for the St@@ en@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and should add your template ( 9 ) to add your template ( 9 ) to add an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ pack ; mail@@ ing@@ list feature @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
&quot; if you use this tool to get used , you need to put your template &apos;s base in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied to the template . these settings will be rented for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root of the Wur@@ zel@@ ord@@ ner , the folder structure is released , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder updates is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons , with which you can change the enlarge and change the position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button increased the present picture . it is center@@ ed to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; p@@ etty : this kno@@ b shed the above picture . in case you want to apply the size of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatic the default size .
&amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; presents three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , created but , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ b pictures . &quot;
&quot; un@@ shar@@ p @-@ m@@ ask is working on the contrast to let a picture look like it . actually , there is a really good job . you can use it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the shar@@ p . he is a little more complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this in turn leads to a little bl@@ ades . this again leads to a little vulner@@ able . the same phenomenon can be observed if paint points will be printed out of paper . SLR cameras will normally need more bear@@ able shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; in JP@@ EG images often have been applied to a camera internal shar@@ p@@ ation . images in the raw format , it must always be explo@@ ited during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can already turn a shar@@ p device during the reader of the picture . if you de@@ activate this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing coating process . you can call with the menu item .
&quot; however , you should deal with caution since the results are not very naturally effective : the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the ed@@ ges , but also rein@@ force the noise . in general it is the need for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image the tool re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing . you can reach it more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw soft and experim@@ enting something with settings . the pre @-@ re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ shar@@ p mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help edit the picture . the pre @-@ filter@@ ing shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the standard values often generate good results , and should first create the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ p m@@ ask at strong , are rob@@ ing and the impression of atro@@ cities in the vicinity of shar@@ p ed@@ ges . &quot;
the radius represents a like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter are affected . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore make pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the left one which is added to the original . thus the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is put .
&quot; the tail value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to use differ@@ ential amount . one can thus be used for a ed@@ ges of the filter . in this way these areas are taken with a soft change between the ton@@ es and therefore the nic@@ ity in faces , heavens and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ shar@@ p mas@@ king filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the worked image , ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ se mas@@ k@@ ate was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a tail value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; tool Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed a picture by enhancing the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to be protected by copyright shel@@ ter filters , algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this tool tries to get a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing quot ; this is better approach as just trying the photo to shar@@ p . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ ews . re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing reaches better results than un@@ shar@@ p mas@@ king . you can start it out of the menu by using colors re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel , which causes far from the original qu@@ amp@@ les . the F@@ IR is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular sh@@ afts : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most images should result the default value 1 good results . you can get a higher value if your image should be very bl@@ ur but should then be at home .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help arms . needed cor@@ relation can be from 0 @-@ 1 . needed values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the tight@@ ening effect of the module .
&quot; Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce arms . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 is rarely helpful , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further lubric@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arms . in most cases you should use the cor@@ relation to zero , so you might also have cor@@ relation to cor@@ relation and / or@@ den space filters . &quot;
&quot; mat@@ ric@@ ity size : this value determines the size of the transformer @-@ atri@@ x . an increase in mat@@ ric@@ ity size can choose good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save the save as and loading buttons are exactly used for this purpose . any re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing parameters which you set will be stored for later and can then be loaded later .
try all the cuts , colour and int@@ ensity re@@ viewing on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations make changes not immediately visible , but later they remain un@@ pleasant ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally produces shar@@ p mas@@ king produce better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur masks , a larger neighborhood used as a shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ shar@@ p , un@@ shar@@ p needs always produce ar@@ oma . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the un@@ shar@@ p filter . however , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always just as good as the un@@ shar@@ p m@@ ask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in dealing with small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small im@@ fo@@ ed picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ shar@@ p colour image has to be correct@@ ed . this picture was made with a analogue camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto @-@ focus left .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the un@@ shar@@ p of the area of the ab@@ eg@@ ated to generate a natural pill .
the color smooth@@ es allows a customized color for the pill . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones then you can set this here .
the tool image correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the In@@ quired algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ caution as starter to simpli@@ fy the restoration of the available settings are below :
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; Detail@@ ed p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an equal smooth@@ ed over the image . a value of 0,@@ 9 should provide details so that no har@@ dening should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
jud@@ ging addi@@ ction Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed in all directions while taking a value close to 1 only in a direction smooth@@ es . if you have a high value for similar patterns . JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te are best to be elimin@@ ated in the vicinity of 1 .
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing effect on all@@ es@@ . p defines the relative smo@@ othing . put this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , since it is then difficult to es@@ timate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you need a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns to how often the algorith@@ m is going to run . usually dates here 1 or 2 .
&quot; Wink@@ el@@ gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is also chosen , there should also be small for a long running time . you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable . &quot;
&quot; integr@@ ale step@@ width &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ale step@@ width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low . he doubl@@ ed but the term . we therefore recommend it to release him .
the buttons save as well as loading exactly this . every setting of image errors can be correct@@ ed in a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; image errors correct@@ ing is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can nevertheless take a very long time , and take a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button cr@@ ying . &quot;
below you can see how the image occurs with Small arms have been fixed . the module is done on a photo that is used in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . as you see is a pec@@ uli@@ ar camera during the trip is caused by a bad film store during the journey and correct@@ ed the correct@@ ed picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; smoke reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce Bil@@ dr@@ au@@ ges . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool establ@@ ishes a select@@ able image filters , to remove spots and other arti@@ facts on the left . it can also be used to remove sensor control of the camera or Mo@@ ire@@ ac@@ ute ; effects of un@@ sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sens@@ ors of digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot top shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ b cater@@ er that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that filter the filter per pixels and can spread the image via the image and color in it becomes smooth@@ ed and thus clean@@ ed smaller errors . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing : controls the pix@@ el@@ bow changes . if it increases the pix@@ able filter changes . if it may change the channel filter , if you may change the ed@@ ges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer receive and ro@@ ds or lubric@@ ating again . &quot;
ed@@ ges : controls the frequency response to the shar@@ p . this value improves the frequency answer@@ ing of the filter . if he can occur on a value close to the max@@ im if you want to remove a vig@@ or or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance oler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either paint or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour @-@ toler@@ ate of the picture . we recommend you either paint or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; GAMMA : controls the gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which type typically refers to increase . it also simpli@@ fy the atten@@ de@@ es . &quot;
&quot; absor@@ ption : controls the adjustments of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ it@@ ter@@ absor@@ ption . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is increased when he can occur at his minimum , can ru@@ ff@@ ling and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter in the ed@@ ges . he can remove smo@@ k@@ heads and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; save and loading : these buttons will be used exactly for this . all parameters for space reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how low reduction reduction of your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed with ( 2 ) . the room reduction was applied with the standard settings .
sometimes an image to cr@@ ack for your purpose . the solution to draw a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ p . use it with the smo@@ othing and experim@@ ent you with the smo@@ othing . the Pre@@ view on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ or@@ ations gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts , sound@@ proof@@ ing , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , com@@ plement@@ ary images in digital , original or subsequent digi@@ tis@@ ed images is carried out along the image contin@@ ents and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorith@@ m can be used for colour and tex@@ ture . the algorith@@ m is carried out with another tool , the image faul@@ ts , carried out . the algorith@@ m to rest@@ oring was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the comp@@ ression of JP@@ EG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a temp@@ ted comp@@ res@@ ist algorithms ; - small standards which will be seen in un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as well as loading exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take a very long time and take a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce space like a photo with equ@@ ation mig@@ raine . the module is applied to an black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) - this module is recognized with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO ( TM ) - the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time Tex@@ tures reduce to an old color photo that can be read with a scanner . you can see the scan arms lighting and the photo op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allowed it hot@@ pixel of photos that were used with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i Project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are especially in high quality raw mode photos a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG comp@@ ression over a built @-@ in op@@ pression for hom@@ ewood . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hom@@ ely Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; there are currently no manual method to select the poor pixel . &quot;
download this file in the assi@@ stan@@ ts with the kno@@ b dark . the tool is automatically recognis@@ ing the hot and bright pixels . these are high@@ lighted in the image @-@ show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark picture to correct picture . a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and this automatically invites you to the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result of the result . the pro@@ pi@@ er shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixel are superior in all areas .
choose an area around the def@@ ects pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
thir@@ st : it will be an average of the neighbor@@ ing pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ects on the block . for an 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation is made this separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
Lin@@ ear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ en surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of linear curve ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ects pixels in the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) will be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cu@@ bic : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ ku@@ b@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of ku@@ b@@ ische Kur@@ ven ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) will be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ects pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied to 300 % enlarged ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed picture is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the Vign@@ etting , i.e. op@@ pressed cor@@ ners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; past@@ ure objective , especially the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ated the whole sensor range not as well . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ ows ) they reduce the cor@@ ners and ri@@ bb@@ ons of the image by causing the light the sensor there . Tele@@ obj@@ ectives are also demonstrated in circumstances . &quot;
&quot; but he also has cons . many center @-@ filter need one factor 1,5 or 2 at the bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter , which it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . past@@ ure objects should also use with center @-@ filter , an opening of f / 16 or small , because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen . &quot;
&quot; with the great Bel@@ i@@ cht@@ ing areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ .@@ valve transformation at a raw image that is used without this filter . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Wal@@ ker . &quot;
with three shelves you can control the Vign@@ etting feed filters and with three other the exposure of the target area .
&quot; density : this parameter controlled the degree of light stands on the point of the greatest density filter . the standard density amounts to 2,@@ 0 , what a op@@ tic filter with a bl@@ ender adjustment of 1 , ent@@ sp@@ er . enhance the density to compens@@ ate for a bigger degree of Vign@@ etting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree of Vign@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous , contrast , contrast , and gam@@ ma -@@ settings : the machining of an image with the v@@ ign@@ ant correction , reduces the lumin@@ os@@ ity of the pixels . you have to feed the exposure of the target balance with these options , since you need to only increase the settings only . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re @-@ tuning of the target balance , so let the values for lumin@@ os@@ ity / contrast / gam@@ ma with zero and use the Grad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color Grad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vign@@ etting Cor@@ rection on a picture is applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ etting in the cor@@ ners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . an leu@@ ch@@ strength@@ ke@@ - and contr@@ asting picture was also carried out with the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Lin@@ sen@@ consum@@ ing is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric intake . colour@@ ful dist@@ or@@ tions can not be correct@@ ed with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second grass treated the general geomet@@ rical intake of the left and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gr@@ ades has a similar tour effect but at the ed@@ ges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades fixed the distant corner opposite to the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be elimin@@ ated every geomet@@ ric intake .
general : this value controls the strength of dist@@ or@@ tion second Gr@@ ades . with negative values can be correct@@ ed bot@@ s@@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tions and positive values ho@@ ver@@ tu@@ ary dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of dist@@ or@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value acts more strongly to the re@@ change than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the cor@@ ners parameter has the re@@ mark of the parameter General .
Zoom : this value domin@@ ates the bri@@ um and thereby causes a correction of the first gr@@ ades through . negative values are larger while positive the image .
&quot; light : this value j@@ us@@ ed the brightness in the cor@@ ners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the cor@@ ners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ated the dialog with a preview the intake correction . the values you use for your photo , are stored and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
the tonn@@ age or low correction should be performed before all the cuts or size of changes . at the best guide you can re@@ cut this correction as all the first by . if you perform a picture to cut and afterwards a boat @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to show you this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal storage line , in your photo and press the left mouse button to fix the lines in this spot . in the connection you can correct the tonn@@ - / low dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you have a kis@@ sing dist@@ or@@ tion will correct the resulting image black cor@@ ners . you can transform this with the cutting tool in the menu to transform out the image processing or about the Zoom controller of this dialog .
for most images the tonn@@ age correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as photographs from the front as frame and paintings is the perspective so to correct all the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always keep an easy det@@ err@@ ation of the perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age form applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u@@ .org website which re@@ produced under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensi@@ tiv@@ an area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you can see the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; ben@@ e@@ ath the preview you can adjust two parameters , film gr@@ itt and film@@ ensi@@ tivity ( ISO ) . activate the bas@@ kets of a high sensitive film and the domin@@ ance of the color Green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter colour channels to re@@ produce infr@@ ared film measures , especially the green can@@ al makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the far@@ bin@@ ations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ing@@ fil@@ ming gallery applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this worked image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been put on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the rest .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; filter film gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classic high speed filter@@ ing as for example the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to raise the sensitivity of the films made great silver @-@ gr@@ inder of photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
&quot; the film gr@@ inder of your photo gives a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to move this special , Gallery @-@ like , and @-@ photograph@@ ed sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be used to control the int@@ ensity and gran@@ ularity of the gran@@ ulators , even though often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bas@@ kets , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film work@@ book on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; filter oil gem@@ stone created the appearance of an oil of oil . it uses a b@@ ite protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; filter oil wr@@ inkl@@ es gives your digital pictures a cute appearance as an oil @-@ gem@@ s . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the ober@@ e choose the Brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brush are better suited for large pictures . smooth@@ es controlled the smo@@ othing or , from the other side view , the qu@@ eness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the bag is marked with the ( 2 ) . Brush size for this 640 pixels large image is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; filter co@@ ding lab@@ eling use colour and int@@ ensity setting to create a co@@ hl@@ ham . it is helpful for this effect . it is helpful , if you imagine what scene you could have chosen to sk@@ et@@ ate you . these would have good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller el@@ ect the tab@@ ern@@ acle and the lower j@@ us@@ ed the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the consistency filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adaptation of the int@@ ensity setting .
the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; filter Gra@@ v@@ ur has shaped your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was produced in wax . it uses a protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; filter Gra@@ v@@ ur is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he does not work well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and int@@ ensity to transform the image into a gray , car@@ rot landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the amount of filtration . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the worked image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of consumption . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ el@@ ength 1 : shares the image in cells and lets it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wav@@ el@@ ength 2 : analog to the wav@@ el@@ ength 1 will dist@@ ort the picture here with another version of glass be@@ ware .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of un@@ shar@@ p effects . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom un@@ shar@@ p : exp@@ ir@@ y the picture along the circular lines that can be seen from a central point . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ om@@ iting camera and thereby gener@@ ates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography .
radi@@ ale Un@@ shar@@ p : simpli@@ fy the picture by rotation of the pixels by a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ p of a revol@@ ving camera .
remove the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camer@@ aman . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; flexibility : simpli@@ fy the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the dis@@ shar@@ p of a linear moving , z : B : out of a car or train photo , camera . &quot;
soft@@ ens un@@ shar@@ p : exp@@ ir@@ y the picture of the dark and strong in the bright ton@@ es . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , Gl@@ am@@ our @-@ photos or to add a warm and subtle Gl@@ üh@@ ens . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ chen@@ er : simpli@@ fy the image by random shi@@ fting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ cur@@ ing of a very will@@ ingly mov@@ able camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ p : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and exp@@ ir@@ y it without the rest .
mos@@ ai@@ c : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a cute little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ops on your image . this gives it natural your images a n@@ ate appearance . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected protected algorithms .
&quot; dro@@ pl@@ et size allows the size of the drop to change . since the dro@@ pl@@ et size is not necessary automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the optical effect of drops in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; image processing a area free of rain thro@@ ws . use it to choose the area , e.g. a face that will remain freely to choose the area , the area will remain free from ra@@ ent@@ rop@@ y . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ an Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and that worked image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can transform you in the menu or transform your mirrors . &quot;
photo sho@@ ots is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge in a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to hide is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture above , how can you find a picture above ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m of this is used here , makes you a good work . try it and you will see it ourselves . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select size change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool for the size is changing an linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to bl@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio can be kept : if this setting is activated , in the entry of the new size of the original aspect of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , since it is then difficult to es@@ timate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you need a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as well as loading will be used exactly . each inser@@ tion for photo can be stored as a text file and later be loaded later .
photo stor@@ ms is very fast with what it makes it but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo blow@@ s by adding a small colored picture to the double size increases . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of lin@@ ear@@ en standard mag@@ ni@@ fication to compare .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to fix a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo by mouse button , through the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will then see the right while you move your mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut out . you can change the size of the right area . you can change the size of the right area by clicking on the cor@@ ners of the law . a new rect@@ angle will simply create it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the condition , use the button add the button button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or file saving up to the menu file to save the newly selected photo . &quot;
&quot; in the default area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the cor@@ ners with the mouse . the side ratio that you have defined in dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the tool of sales , you can specify the orientation as a Hoch@@ format or cross @-@ format . in the same format is always assigned to the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After sales ratio is used to use a relative page ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can see cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for photo@@ copy and their side ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to choose the choice automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; below in dialog , you can cut the area with the Max . R@@ atio the area for addi@@ ction to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After sales ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the composition aid allow assistance to help you put your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmoni@@ ous triangle : harmoni@@ ous parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ rule , harmoni@@ ous tri@@ an@@ gles is a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmoni@@ ous tri@@ an@@ gles at the diagram . &quot;
&quot; Golden center : the golden center is a division which is on different natural growth u@@ ster , such as the spir@@ al of a Nau@@ til@@ us Mu@@ schel or the Bl@@ üt@@ ten@@ ders of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things to which we are seen as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 4,@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it has been used for the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks that used your temple and pyram@@ ids during all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together in order to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . one composition that is usually follows as a visual harmoni@@ ous . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid auxili@@ aries available when you mer@@ ge a picture . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
the Gol@@ den@@ e Spir@@ al will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ rule the golden spir@@ al creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spir@@ al and creates a balanced visual river .
&quot; a further rule is the right corner of the golden spir@@ al , also called golden an@@ gles . it should be a line to guide the golden spir@@ al . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its purpose . &quot;
the Golden Trinity is also guided by the above mentioned Spir@@ al . your ver@@ tices are the middle points of the golden an@@ gles . take note that in contrast to harmoni@@ ous tri@@ an@@ gles , golden an@@ gles are no simultaneous tri@@ an@@ gles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be a static object of dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ an@@ gles around your frame make you generate a effect of professional photo@@ graphic dynamic Symmet@@ ry . try your image cells in one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ an@@ gles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach any other way .
the options horizontal and ver@@ tically reflect can be used to reflect the harm@@ onic parti@@ tions .
&quot; with the button colour , you can set the color of the auxili@@ aries . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxili@@ aries can be invisible . in this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any an@@ gles .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you can &apos;t make the camera with just vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things to fix a angle . you can transform this with the &amp; digi@@ tization . you can transform your free rot@@ ation and avoid the target angle .
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button , you can set the sli@@ der again on 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right top . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module provides a horizontal and vertical line available . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ se the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you film@@ ed an image you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the cor@@ ners . a possibility to fix this is the function transform@@ ing to explo@@ it out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . note that however the above warning .
all the prosp@@ ective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fix@@ ture on the so called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squ@@ ares to the cor@@ ners of your image . the preview will then automatically be added automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a bit ver@@ ted . for a single adjustment is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have adjusted the perspective you get un@@ pleas@@ ing tri@@ angular holes in the cor@@ ners . a possibility of doing this to a few , it is the image with transform@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
the sound tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is not rot@@ ating . with other words , a rect@@ angle will be transformed into a Parall@@ el@@ ram . you can start this module about transform@@ ing she@@ er . &quot;
push your image by using the horiz@@ on an@@ gles and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertical at the same time . if you click on preferences . a preview of the effectiveness will display you and the new dimensions of the target area will be displayed on the right of the display area .
&quot; to your help you will finish a vertical and a horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your photo and press the left mouse button to fix the lines now to j@@ amm@@ ate your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the shots , the image will be a bit ver@@ ily . for a single shot is generally neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , but two schem@@ es , twice as much embarrass@@ ment , and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the she@@ ar , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the cor@@ ners . a possibility to eliminate them is the image with transform@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the formats are therefore dependent on your system , and in some cases , by the type such as these libraries were utili@@ zed . in most distribu@@ tions , you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; displays only files in formats to know . this happens from the file extension and a comparison with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change the file in the image processing ; you can change the file extension . in the section configuration you will find more information on this .
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format . a more detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ resses on digital pictures . thus red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced to store the data data on an efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smooth results than JP@@ EG with the same comp@@ res@@ sion@@ ratio . the 2000@@ s version can also store it freely if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw format , so you can read at Wikipedia , The lumin@@ ous land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw conver@@ ters of &amp; digi@@ F . in the section configuration you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed ; supports the shop of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is supported in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all supported cameras you can see below on the web page of Dave coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ed :
many digital cameras will support the recording of short films . these cli@@ ps are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . however , this formats and will look for the movies . &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ers ; but the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies to play the program for play@@ back . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphics are used in science , especially in science , especially in the computer science , used . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph@@ s newly re@@ counting and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphic ; in one &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to set more than these no@@ des )
&quot; other needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graph@@ s provided . you are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without a argument , the main window will open and the ( empty ) list pay@@ ed files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like at the bottom of the screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graphics space is larger than the string menu . you can choose a fixed position in this list or select this position automatically . &quot;
the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ unter without special samp@@ ling , left and right with penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ Taste ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ om@@ es is restricted in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum seal of a graph .
&quot; if the currently in &amp; k@@ graph@@ vie@@ wers , loaded from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h will be loaded or if you want to ign@@ ore your decision , so later you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings c@@ graph@@ ically ; set up , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open an graph@@ ite body outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can store your choice permanently , but they can also change with the addition dialogue . &quot;
&quot; at the program launch , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can change your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also define how the graph can be divided into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s who will be shown on a page . if you are able to hold the side ratio , the sides may not be filled by the respective parts of the graphic . &quot;
page show with one on several pages distributed without head@@ line and with a different fon@@ ts
&quot; the Renew@@ able shop is the possibility to specify the behavior if a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically load or the changes ign@@ ore ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the opening gives the possibility to define the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if a graph is opened outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running sitting ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
the page seat management is the possibility to set up the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can define a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or do not ) or determine where you start in .
the context menu is usually associated with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; the following possibilities :
here you can select below various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries how they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for gr@@ ated graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or histor@@ ically int@@ ends of geri@@ ed graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m defines the ed@@ ges in the same direction ( from top to bottom , or from left to right ) and then tried to produce as short rab@@ bits and as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ eri@@ ched graph@@ s . it produces int@@ est@@ ation in accordance with the jump@@ ing model . thereby the Kam@@ ada K@@ aw@@ ai algorith@@ m is used to be syn@@ onymous with Statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m creates a jump@@ ing model -@@ layout . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ sk@@ er solution for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster@@ s . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can read tools available to create new pictures and retri@@ eve them .
&quot; this module can be used to be used to create new pictures from external sources and removable . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images scan@@ nen : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner which supports by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . this works you must have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; if you can open the menu images scan@@ nen , a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values of du@@ cr@@ he to read your image accordingly , before you read the image of your needs , before you see with the button sc@@ anning . the este@@ em file will be displayed in the right , lower left . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
note that the window will be completely shown because some settings may otherwise be displayed otherwise .
&quot; after you have push@@ ed the buttons , you have to wait until Scan is completed and the window will specify the options of the target image . here you can select the comp@@ ression and type of image file . you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 . you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create the image to be saved . &quot;
screenshots you can create after you selected in the menu impor@@ ters &gt; Scre@@ w ... a window appears in which you can set the various screens :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program is selected , the retri@@ eve program will disappear , so you can read other screens and windows you will read , after a short delay , read the visible work@@ space , just the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screens are waiting before it starts . if you need to turn on other working areas , you should choose this delay high enough to navig@@ ate the time to navig@@ ate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screenshot of the screen , the dialog Options page has been published with the options described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS to add GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata for an image and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geo@@ graphic loc@@ alisation provides tools available for images geo@@ graphic in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , to loc@@ alis@@ e . height , long@@ itudinal and lati@@ tude . &quot;
to download your images with geographical data you need a GPS tr@@ ace as XML files in g@@ px formats . g@@ ps@@ bab@@ el and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can mer@@ ge a number of previously selected images with a GPS @-@ track .
choose the pictures you want to get cor@@ related in the main window and call the menu on top of the dialogue will then load up a possible cor@@ relation to time and loc@@ alization . this file will of course be recorded with the same time at the same places like the images of your camera .
when the file loads a automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red . GPS Tr@@ ace will be recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore needs to be implemented in GMT @-@ time . this can be done with the tim@@ ez@@ one . put it here your compan@@ ions .
the setting for maximum time @-@ devi@@ ation gives a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and Camer@@ az@@ eit . lies the devi@@ ation below are the data combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no tr@@ ap data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then download all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t know that in reality a locom@@ otive differences between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ rel@@ ing to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog will use the coordinates from a call to the next place you will only use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found and set up with the displayed area and enlarge it , you can always be selected by way until you have to have a given accuracy . the card can always be selected between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ f@@ tool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to Version 4.01 . you can specify the albums which are export@@ ed as HTML pages , and set the parameters for the HTML pages , UT@@ F @-@ 8 co@@ ded to make a best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four tab in which the settings can be adapted . the rider selection allows you to select all albums on the right . you can quickly select a large number of albums on the right , you can quickly find a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this tab is largely made . the option for each picture is created . if you then click on an image , the image is displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder that contains the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
with other color deep you can change the default depth . it is of course the fil@@ esi@@ ze . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab occurr@@ ence allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the Thumbnails that are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progressive step indicates the user as far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the sides , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore launch the program . the web browser is started automatically at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press closing the module . &quot;

&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the file selection dialog with which you will then copy the files to which you will copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you put on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all images . you can copy from anywhere , but not in every target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ di@@ sers module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the module MPEG co@@ di@@ sers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module is used to insert a basic video file . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are set automatically onto the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards you can start using Extr@@ as MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected images are recorded in image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD you need to select the respective TV Standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the image will be displayed . a low value gener@@ ates very su@@ dden , a high against it is very su@@ lat@@ ed image change . &quot;
the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt you should set it black . the name and the path of the generated file you can specify under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as possible as the name mp@@ g .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy the creation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can drink a coffee or enjoy the slideshow , if you return . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ di@@ sers or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below . &quot;
the printing wizard allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper together in standard Photo@@ graphic sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. : useful to improve you or using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in one of three formats , JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command@@ ment tools d@@ cra@@ w by Dave coff@@ in . an original outcomes created by d@@ cra@@ w not that it will be the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
&quot; first select the raw file to be converted , and launch the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the kno@@ b preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adapt the values to optimize the conversion process for the conversion process . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be j@@ us@@ sel@@ . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a quarter of R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contr@@ asting information . if your camera has been working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conver@@ gence . JP@@ EG uses a consum@@ ed algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free L@@ ZW comp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; if you present your pictures often or you later continue to use elsewhere , you should not use the JP@@ EG format before proce@@ eds the image quality det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the raw file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break the conversion again , so you can cancel this process . &quot;
the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode so you are sure if you are using testing on a single image which are the best settings .
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for some pictures . you have here the possibility of an existing file automatically to over@@ write . this is helpful , if this in an earlier attempt was produced . a preview is not available . the pro@@ gressi@@ ves is evident on how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album , using the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame of all images of a album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starter and the timeline stamp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it is used to enlarge the image range from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can use the image below or enlarge . these are provided four types of image change :
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the side ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : compare change in two dimensions . here remains the side ratio unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional size change in two dimensions . the side ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for image pressure . the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , edge size and back@@ color , is accordingly adapted . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the other pictures before .
&quot; after which you have started the module , the images will be displayed in the selected images . you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog box . for the most recently selected picture will display a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also move images to the picture list and add to the images to add the images to the list .
&quot; with the kno@@ b images , the selected images will be removed from the list of the pictures . &quot;
after you have selected all pictures to open the button OK the New News -@@ window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and subject to the subject .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most of e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of the e @-@ mail . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for setting the pictures . your configuration is stored and every time used to change it .
choose your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird so you must specify the correct path for your installation .
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the election of comments in a attached file , the comments are attached to the pictures into a text file , and the mail is laid . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free formats as for example T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore do PNG transparent using a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
if you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format and add the original files in the JP@@ EG format then the original exhibits can be added to the pictures .
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically with the status messages , in search of errors . your E @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button , you can watch this window ? s . &quot;
&quot; after the drawing of the module &apos;s advanced Di@@ asch@@ au will be shown a window with questions like you have shown your slideshow , here you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the OpenGL cap@@ tions used in the presentation emplo@@ ying very elegant pic@@ ks using OpenGL . you have to possess an appropriate graphic card , because otherwise the slideshow will be very slowly . &quot;
the Fil@@ ename option shows that the fil@@ ename of images in the lower left corner during the presentation will be displayed .
the option Bow ensures that the presentation in a final loop is displayed . you can then stop them manually with Es@@ c ; Canc@@ el .
&quot; the option images to choose by chance , that the pictures are shown in a random order . it is therefore not used the order of images in the album . &quot;
&quot; in delay between the pictures , the tim@@ eless distance between the individual images are set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition period . you should therefore share this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there is more than a do@@ zen transition between which you can choose . rand@@ om@@ ly select from any transition between the images to another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can keep the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side screen , you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Module Time &amp; Date j@@ us@@ ement currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ en.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module back@@ grounds is a tool to put an image as wallpaper for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menus , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by this brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in people , places and in the group keywords items available . &quot;

&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is shown by pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather than same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and have a look at the quick@@ start , the screenshot and the intro@@ duct@@ ory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and select the demo , if you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo start . presented a few sample pictures and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an integral HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the captain of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the timeline . a picture of this guy see here : . as the name sugge@@ sts , this box shows you about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display several different time units . each tab shows then another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by clicking the lad@@ der only 10 @-@ minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the timeline can be used on the following ways : you can change the displayed view from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first image of this date in the preview display ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navig@@ ate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select one area of the timeline by clicking the mouse button and drag the mouse over the rul@@ er of the timeline , so if you choose a domain , you will see you in the preview view only pictures of this time box . you can choose the selection by clicking on a beams of the timeline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; presents two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create using the File File Format .
&quot; before HTML pages , you must make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and destination . in the following each area is described more exactly . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the sur@@ plus and a description one that is supposed to include HTML @-@ file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is created whether one &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is intended to see on the track page . stit@@ ching information about export files can be found in .
&quot; most recently , you can choose which information can be shown on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information is shown from a party . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are shown . you may not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain views . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like the HTML pages . most settings are clear , which is why not specifically entered . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resol@@ utions for the pictures . therefore , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no more photos that have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the vie@@ wers of your side can change the resolution at any time . he can thus search your images with low resolution , as well as if he wants to display a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this Settings area you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
best select the basic set for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set of a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first of all you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored . this folder will be automatically added and the next time , you can select either a folder or one of K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is able to choose a URL , after the pages you were created , the URL you can select here . otherwise the web browser will be laun@@ ching in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files created by you created HTML files still not in the final destination , see how the import function , see , correct , you must specify the final destination of the files , but the base ord@@ ner in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the just described settings have been included all three on the base folder or URLs . in this will be a sub@@ folder , whose name is set in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might have to add an HTML page to the image of pictures , etc . if you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not yet to do . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images in a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file . these can import other into your database . the image characteristics are used with ex@@ - and import@@ ed .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . you are differenti@@ ate whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file . the advantage to save all images to the file . the advantage is so independent and this file can be so independent . the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either create a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ters ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im -@@ file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im -@@ file is looking for the pictures in two simple way . first , the images will not be found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im -@@ file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im -@@ file by using HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the exports of images described you can refer to the File menu file . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im -@@ files . there are you the following three options available :
with the option Manu@@ ally to copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ ated to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already been comp@@ ressed and the XML file itself very small is worth unable to comp@@ ress it . if you want to un@@ comp@@ ress this and simply select the option of export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum load@@ ability . if you want to send your friends photos , since the .@@ k@@ im -@@ file otherwise would be very large . here you can limit the size where every picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the En@@ ding .@@ k@@ im from the Web@@ browser or from the menu file , it is export@@ ed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the export@@ ed data as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for impor@@ ters consists of four steps . first , you need to select what pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import@@ ing images to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you would like to import the category individuals who means to import file ( if you are called a Dan@@ e ) , while this category will be import@@ ed in the third dialogue window , which are import@@ ed to import files in your database , and which categories are in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can switch the categories of the file to import file with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen on the picture .
&quot; it needs to be easy to browse and watch images : if you see pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy vac@@ ations and a picture with your friend , you might want to see all images on which this friend is de@@ pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to set out the information about your pictures , above ( 2 ) the search and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; this album has started as a program for the wal@@ kers of your pictures . however , it was enlarged and today it takes care of your videos . on many places in this manual , but frequently they also include videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of his information in the file index.@@ xml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy on a flo@@ ppy disk or re@@ visions at CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; mer@@ kt the folder that are stored in which your images are automatically saved . if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index.@@ xml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu item settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you can find the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings and options for vie@@ wers can be found . for each setting there is a detailed aid available to you by a ke@@ yp@@ ress on the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in it has been described as you can set for each image different properties , e.g. individuals , places and keyword . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to process an existing groups in order to handle an existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories already mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as stated in . &quot;
&quot; in see the setting options , which are available to you to specify the membership groups , you can select the category you want to configure the category . in the left hand , there is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications such as digi@@ pack and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plugin Interface . sewing information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help @-@ page you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications can be shared with each other , it can test it that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo @-@ database you can either visit the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I could not have war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules of K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share features with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , that the other applications are not supported in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , thus all images that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also must pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all the people , then each entry is an album viewed for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you are using for example the category individuals , it will be selected , so whether you could have chosen people to view and on the module this . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the field modules which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
on the picture you will see an example for a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top a menu and a tool@@ bar window . at the tool@@ bar you will find out more information about your images . in the section we will show up any information about your images . in the section we will show you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to watch any picture with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can add any picture either individually or for a larger number of images to show certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is recorded and all images in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all of these comments can be used for addi@@ tions and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in see three lists with a text field by selecting people , places and keyword . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as you can always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the rel@@ ocation of the pictures within the list , if you have a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be found , so that the names used are moved to the top , the persons can find quickly and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting with date below the list . &quot;

&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to highlight all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California lie all in the US . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to indicate that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the remarks , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is ahead that you can quickly sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the remarks di@@ ver , by moving the lad@@ ders of the frame form , click and move . you can also move from a frame also a private window by drag him out of the window . &quot;

&quot; it is also possible to set a password , which must be given to un@@ lock the images . to set this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please consider that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one you can read all images on the hard disk and to the other , anyone can read the password as an un@@ encryp@@ ted text or delete them . this type of password protection applies only to those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and write hours over hours with them , of course you want to view them at some point . for this reason it has a picture and video viewer . these can be seen from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer you can see in . he clearly shows the picture , but additional all the information you will be using the image , like who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can configure these easily with the mouse and can be displayed correctly . all these options are shown according to a right @-@ click on the viewer . so you can see the context menu you can see below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , right entries to this view . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by clicking the buttons image high and image below . you can jump to the first and last image with tromb@@ one and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . as often it load a new image after a few seconds . how often it will load a new image by selecting the str@@ g button and Plus respectively Min@@ us . started and stopped by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful ability of the beh@@ older of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in completion of a mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch into the full @-@ mode and back to change .
&quot; if you use the vie@@ wers you can use in the image and figure out . with the Min@@ us button , you can get back to a rect@@ angle . with the min@@ us button , you can go back to the middle of the image , and shows how a Zoom rect@@ angle is marked and displays the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can res@@ et your z@@ oom , so that the image is not ge@@ zo@@ om@@ t . with the equ@@ ation sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixels on the screen is equivalent to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos work that in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and min@@ us are .
&quot; with the fil@@ ing menu from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item remarks from the context menu . &quot;
if you can view images it can happen that you can forget a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten it on the picture . at the moment you can check out the image and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . you might not consider the picture to highlight and see more pictures .
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos do you want to launch the viewer with the images and then select it as good or bad , while you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewer to watch images with Mer@@ km@@ alen while you can watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can use the corresponding letter . in see a picture , where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , you can edit them in your browser . this is described in . if you can edit them all of them with comments . this is described in . after that you can copy a module to copy the pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the pre@@ views view , then you can add characteristics to the pictures by clicking the picture for the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for that case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can turn your mixture later . &quot;
&quot; in order you can see an image on the old album . to turn off the painting , from the context menu . to finish the image , simply complete the cross in the tool@@ bar top in the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pov@@ n@@ er ; work , you need to fully control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not completely domin@@ ate , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood . &quot;
in the object you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and presented the object in the wire model .
&quot; you can also choose multiple objects simultaneously . but not the under@@ object of a already selected object , since all under@@ object are already selected by the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object into the object tree , select the position to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; indicates possible positions , the following set @-@ up menu is built @-@ in , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
by delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have altered properties , click on use to take these changes . then you can check the entry into an error message . then , you can click on an application with a fault description . then you can edit the entry and drop the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the integration dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the presented object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL User Documentation to use this property . if this documentation cannot be included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a tex@@ ture or part of a tex@@ ture , you can see a preview of the own view . &quot;
click on preview in the pec@@ uli@@ ar view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen tex@@ ture and if you want to have an underground element ( for example a tex@@ ture within a tex@@ ture map and not the entire tex@@ ture map ) , kreu@@ z you locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation will select the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by fir@@ es with the mouse inside the whole window .
&quot; each object has a wire model a visibility of over@@ head object , or as absolute value . objects are only shown if they are selected or her refl@@ ections of smaller or equal to the work@@ top of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; has a shut@@ down as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need a different match you can set them arbit@@ r@@ ary . you can also save several shut@@ down and easily switch between different regulations . &quot;
&quot; to an@@ chor a window via or under a present view , drag the lower back to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will then show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the starter button in the middle of another view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the card @-@ card top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window of window are f@@ using views , views that are not available in the main window . to solve a view out of the anch@@ oring , drag the starter button on the desktop or click on the little to the left top left in the occasion . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross at the port bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are flo@@ ating , you can make them anywhere . &quot;
the current window view can store you with view window ... save it . it will be a dialog box where you can save the window of the window under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written right . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon of the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu item scene . &quot;
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to fit a scene in various sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes of produce at the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar click or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that can be recognized the properties of the mode . &quot;
in the card card size you can enter the width and height of the calendar image . if you want to enter a small area of the image you choose the app@@ artment field and enter the image cut to the ren@@ dering in the entry field .
&quot; in combination @-@ room quality , you can choose the properties that uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user re@@ flexi@@ bly lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture comes with only a beam per pixel , there may be different errors . these images often do not appear a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or pl@@ ural effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed , if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixels . this technique is called super samp@@ ling .
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super samp@@ ling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ re@@ cur@@ sive method ; re@@ cur@@ si@@ v , because every pixels is becoming more and adap@@ tive because every pixels is dependent and adap@@ tive because the record high@@ lighted by the track@@ ed colors . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , persec@@ uted POV @-@ Ray fixed pixels . if the difference between the pursuit of pixels with super samp@@ ling , then the difference between the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ samp@@ ling , a gradient of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a dep@@ endance of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional str@@ ades per pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
&quot; the re@@ cur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixels . if the difference between colour values are shared , then the pixels in 4 sub@@ pixel , the maximum depth of records are provided with the dep@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is called J@@ it@@ ter@@ ing , called J@@ it@@ ter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ it@@ ter@@ ing , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the bl@@ asting to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular samples . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use Re@@ flex@@ ion . this is an experim@@ ental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use of light reflex@@ ion . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this card card you can set whether the Alpha channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have no object met .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sole Output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import the menu folder ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if during the impor@@ ters error messages or war@@ nings appear ; a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ pov@@ n@@ er ; import@@ ing , write this source text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object into the editor to import the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it adds to the source text of the object into the first opened text file in the editor , just highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste into &amp; k@@ pov@@ nig@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command will be called &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ derer . usually this is pov@@ ray or x @-@ pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the Self @-@ Table View , opens &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; users provide the path to your documents and version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; search@@ es for external files ( for example Al@@ timeter data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first folded file is used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type marks .
you can set the object @-@ catch of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model @-@ views . you can adjust the R@@ aster separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and speed . &quot;
&quot; greater values make a more accurate model , and hence a better result for the shown objects , require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level of two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you provide high degree of proj@@ ections for advanced proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are used . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and sens@@ ory proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display wall , a wall behind the objects indicated . the wall is represented in a chess file patterns made up of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display ground , a floor below the objects is broken down . the floor is represented in a chess file patterns made up of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ on , the non @-@ re@@ cur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for the ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling you can adjust . exact indications concerning parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing shut@@ down procedures or create new window regulations . in the section window , as you can create shut@@ down . &quot;
the combination of standard module : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement during the start of the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ down . a new arrangement can be added with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the kno@@ b removal .
any window of window is identified by the name . the name must be un@@ clear and may not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views of the chosen window configuration . new views can remove you with the button and remove selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with inj@@ ectors , you get the window under the existing window , with card card , you will not receive a card card , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ pov@@ hole ; and now , you would like to begin with any more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create simple scene , among its beginn@@ ings very popular : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warning , consider yourself as a result of only a black screen . if you use a 3D program . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you are unable to adjust camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you insert no light sources , your whole scene in the dark , and you will only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have all faul@@ t@@ less installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window : &quot;
take a little time to get the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols are frequently used , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ pov@@ nig@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . highlight the scene and select the menu item . therefore , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene , which you can produce . especially notice the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene from the view of the camera . this is showing you the result of the Ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera . if they click on , you see the content of the view object , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find out more details . &quot;
&quot; change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the camera on a button and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you use the button or press the input button , change the wire model @-@ views and the object instantly according to these settings . as a result they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ ser@@ ted body Qu@@ ader ) , and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an aw@@ k@@ ward method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ nig@@ er ; actually offers a simple possibility . you can use an infin@@ ite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button or paste the button . in the object , the new name will be immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is now also the level , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , stret@@ ches the level up to the horiz@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if you can see the object tree , you will notice that you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so that you get to know some of these parameters . choose shi@@ fting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; choose only the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose from the moment you choose something different . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inser@@ ted . please change the name in the stand@@ ings watch ( name = ground pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button of view , you can see how the Pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments will only be a Matt@@ it &apos;s material because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment nor do you think that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also there are many possibilities , but take the easi@@ est way . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see in the preview no colour on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
the material for the soil is now correct . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
&quot; of course , this is not the far@@ ben@@ . you have expected . here are another settings necessary . in the window list you have to enter into this record twice ( you can also edit this entry twice ( you can also do so much more frequently , but the chess board color can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object of jed@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step you should already exec@@ ute you , since you should have understood the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; it should be understood as simple as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the entry into contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball is weak@@ ened with the ground . otherwise , the ball will flo@@ p over the ground , since you have moved the ground around a unit according to bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now yield a strange result : as previously seen , the ball @-@ surface appears as a Matt@@ it &apos;s material . put you in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now move a material . as in the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
choose first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click the sphere of pig@@ ment and select the values as follows :
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects if you take time , some Fin@@ ish features include : &quot;
change the values like in the following screens and click on or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the at@@ titudes and reflection result are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed finishes , even if metal : even not selected is : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you have &amp; k@@ pov@@ n@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have already learned so much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you are a scene ray@@ trac@@ er , sho@@ ots the Ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the vie@@ wers ( i.e. from the camera to det@@ ect the scenes , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how to fo@@ g the atmosp@@ h@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus the scene will be processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see any camera with which you can view the scene . without a light source you will also see nothing but the image is simply black . obviously needs every scene to be ger@@ ated , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ pov or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; created
always when you open a new model or create the file in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
&quot; if you have already stored the model it is stored under the same name , there is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space . &quot;
introduces the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last store will be disc@@ arded .
this menu item you can only then select if you have not saved any changes in the scene .
to be repeated the last rear command . this menu item you can only then select if you are not going back @-@ going back .
stores the current window of window and opens a dialog to enter a name for a new order or to write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ pov@@ n@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ zel and the standard behaviour . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new options with this option ; -@@ Comm@@ ands change or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add to this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; -@@ Comm@@ ands and remove .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to adjust the surface , without any Beu@@ le on the surface individually , and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is usual , the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a tex@@ ture map . &quot;
basics are simple geomet@@ rical shapes that you can use as building blocks . these models are produced from do@@ zen or even hundreds of this fundamental body . these models are then processed in order to give them a realistic look .
a tex@@ ture map is a way to give the surface of a object on pixel base , by application of an image file as colour card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser which you can select images to be displayed .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ page .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files on you with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the button Return .
you can adjust whether any picture is to be displayed in a separate window or if all images are always the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just select the first characters of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . if an appropriate fil@@ ename is found , the file will be high@@ lighted by pus@@ hing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cartridges cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up in the two others , short rest for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective windows can be defined . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen is filled with the background color , which you can set down further down . default . default &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when sending the name of the last open folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to fill out a background color , in order to fill out the background of the screen in full training mode . if in the window , the window is bigger than the image is also filled in the background with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also be de@@ pic@@ ted . &quot;
this option is enlarged for large images on the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
determine whether the slideshow with the first image in the folder or with the selected image should start .
&quot; the time period between the image change at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . is this value to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until they will edit the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the various types of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cart@@ on cards for the display and short @-@ run @-@ in for the browser .
this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo working based on the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; project .
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo , a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform cor@@ rec@@ tions and modifications . &quot;
&quot; as the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ foto &apos;s photo , making it as simple as possible errors or possible improvements . where you can use a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to complete your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. that users and developers have to help each other . if you want to answer any more frequently user of &amp; show@@ ing@@ List . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you should be spoken English , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best way to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer of mail@@ ing list . instructions to join the developer mail@@ ing@@ list by &amp; show@@ foto . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you a lot of control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that select the behaviour of &amp; show@@ foto ; you must change in eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Bel@@ i@@ cht@@ ation indicators , you can select the color that will display the colors with what you should show in contrast , in contrast , under@@ exposed a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has one side bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to select the pictures . the same page can also be found in the image processing . you can display them in which you click on one of the five tab : &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a application for scan@@ nen of images that does not make more than images to scan and ab@@ err@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images , which can no longer be opened as images to scan and remove the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can display the pictures before leaving it . &quot;
you can check the status of support your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ project@@ .org / cgi @-@ bin / driver@@ .pl .
a standard scanner can be opened on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal can be opened or if no standard scanner was opened , then a dialog to choose from the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press the OK button to open the scanner . Canc@@ el will end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ bk@@ san@@ e ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; in order to start a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ sch@@ can and then the sc@@ anning area for the final scan can be started by the Pre@@ view button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can be drawn into the image and out of the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the z@@ oom in the window . &quot;
when the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview show a preview show in the settings , then the image will be expressed in a for@@ efr@@ ont , shown below is displayed , then the image will be stored and lie ? en leads to an ab@@ ort and you get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the kno@@ b settings , the same name will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , prior to save the memory . in this case the option is selected to display a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be elected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images will open up . dialogue to save the dialog in a previously defined folder . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it is automatically saved with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save Save without after one file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored on saving without after a file name , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button . &quot;
this parameter defines an image fix for automatically to save images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in dialog . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of the jed@@ es@@ mal . the string chain # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adapt to save the image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression value at stor@@ ing . if choose the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the kno@@ b aid starts the K@@ DE @-@ aid with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button of the button is laun@@ ching dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the kno@@ b settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; &quot;

&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used like all other programs sc@@ ary . below you will find a list of this pump@@ zel and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut you can set up with the right mouse button in the player window and select the button @-@ mouse button in the player window click and select short@@ cut .
you may possibly respond to existing multimedia keys that it function as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; short @-@ run out function . this makes your keyboard to &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features which can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
AMAR@@ OK supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has still some own command lines . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a refund if the script is not executed on your script , if all required modules are available and use of dialog , so that the user will not run , why a script is not running . &quot;
&quot; begin require &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( K@@ DE Bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is , for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos;@@ exit &quot;
&quot; in the folder of @-@ templates / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts relatively easy . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can control your scripts data with Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be attached .
most of the scri@@ pt@@ ing languages enable the exec@@ ute of external programs and commands . this is usually the function Ex@@ ec ( ) can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; send messages to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts against the default of script . for this reason , the script should be constantly monit@@ ored and appropri@@ ated accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ign@@ ore the events even if it has no use for this . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ figure shows the script to view the storage dialog . to save the storage and loading of the installation data must be run every script itself , Amar@@ ok sets the work place on the folder , where all the data should be saved . &quot;
&quot; track@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played , the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece @-@ length ) . &quot;
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ iz@@ able Tit@@ le : sub@@ menu item@@ 24.de , re@@ placing the path to the selected files of the playlist , you can also use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ized Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu _ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to termin@@ ate , or when the user sends a script , send &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to handle the script . this signal should be processed to do for example , e.g. the storage of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok Script management can also install script packages , which can be compiled by user &amp; z@@ b ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can also be comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can be seen clearly as a Amar@@ ok script . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the bl@@ um@@ ing amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages .
&quot; the main kri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining for lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
if your script is ready to load it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and connect the link to the wiki script page of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; att@@ ach the category AMAR@@ OK ; scripts .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is a audio @-@ player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surpris@@ ingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you can easily drag music into the playlist , instead of going through end@@ less menus within your collection . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos;s Coll@@ ector browser and the quick@@ search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists is still difficult for you . and if you decide on the right hand , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically determine the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gener@@ ational USB devices , so that SI@@ E you want to hear your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok to the advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and f@@ ick - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources the following , to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok to comp@@ ile and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ con@@ f and autom@@ ake , you should comp@@ ile any trouble . if you encounter problems , please note this in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has the most applications for some options that can activate or dis@@ able with the configure script via the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of compil@@ ing options must be fulfilled certain depen@@ dencies , so that they can be used . details can be found in the section System@@ Requirements . &quot;
&quot; enabled Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you should use a full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; leaves yourself without trouble passing on dialogue . the initi@@ ation dialog has several cartridges cards to set up the various functions of &amp; AMAR@@ OK .
player window display the player window in addition to play@@ lists one or out . if the option is swit@@ ched out is only the play@@ lists ( show@@ n@@ 0@@ K ) .
voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ able was compiled . the option out@@ dated the experim@@ ental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
&quot; full design : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ able . this will be compiled the color scheme for the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
voting files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; associated with support for m@@ ood@@ correctly comp@@ ile . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; start , when a browser needs to be required . &quot;
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not listed in the list above . &quot;
playlist to save the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the running playlist .
relative paths for manual stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting becomes &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory of the playlist , use the absolute position of the music files . &quot;
up @-@ to @-@ date piece of the piece change are visible to keep the play@@ lists of play@@ back window - / ab@@ roll@@ ed to keep the running piece always in the visible window section .
&quot; when the piece change to the context @-@ browser change automatically displays the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section of appearance you can adapt &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in fon@@ ts section you can use the use of various writ@@ ings in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; set out fon@@ ts for the following section : play@@ lists window , player @-@ window and context @-@ browser . click on select ... so you can choose a desired f@@ ont out of the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Custom color scheme , you have chosen even the Qu@@ al of your choice and can define a separate colour scheme . use the dis@@ able colors for front and back@@ ing colour . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; after the program play@@ back the play@@ back automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at last bur@@ sting . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is a preview of the O@@ SD and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the f@@ ont . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired f@@ ont for O@@ SD . the App@@ ear@@ field shadow acts that the text in the O@@ SD is sh@@ aded .
own colors will use you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for Scrip@@ ture and background . a click on the color surfaces . if the colors will not use be activated , the pres@@ et &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ colors will be used . &quot;
the sub@@ section display text presents the text created in O@@ SD . through the type of plac@@ ements can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available Plac@@ ards and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ fold monitor environment will appear to O@@ SD .
the card card Audio @-@ Edition lets you select a audio driver from the selection range . some drivers still enable further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card @-@ card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder that you want to browse the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to add a folder into the collection with each name . this section also includes arch@@ ery areas , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder re@@ cur@@ si@@ v as well as this causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; both the anim@@ ated as well as their sub@@ folders according to music .
&quot; changes : allows &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; , the selected folder to monitor changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import@@ ing : causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; all the play@@ lists in your Coll@@ ector folders ( .@@ pl@@ o and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) appear to your collection . the automatically re@@ added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browsers .
the part Coll@@ l@@ ungs database is used to select a database for the collection . the combinations field : can choose between sq@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected as well as My@@ S@@ ql is necessary .
&quot; the section My@@ S@@ ql setup will be used to insert the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; under calcul@@ ator , the computer is inser@@ ted on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is available under which the database is available under Port : the network name , which is made to the connection . &quot;
&quot; using username : and password , enter the data required for the connection to the database . &quot;
the card card last@@ .@@ fm is the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can trans@@ mit the names of st@@ ressed st@@ acking to a last@@ .@@ fm server and to create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your util@@ .@@ fm profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
&quot; stret@@ ched pieces send and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; , the name of a shar@@ p pieces to send your last@@ .@@ fm profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters gain : after activation of this setting will be &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to be stored in each case . note : you do not need comp@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is a audio @-@ player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screens .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK needs only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including those contained ther@@ ein programs , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you have written a small guide on how to K@@ deli@@ bs minimal compiled . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD put ahead that your window manager will work for example . GNO@@ ME will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example , we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably puts one of your files a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can watch the file to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang out the broken file that can delete the cr@@ ash . then you can delete the file and set the collection again .
&quot; mostly , that T@@ agli@@ b is located in reading the Meta @-@ Infos from this file . please note this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; AMAR@@ OK . &quot;
make sure all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if e.g. &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x comp@@ ile it then leads to precip@@ itation at work of Meta @-@ information .
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with blu@@ ez@@ d , then dis@@ able min drive , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the Back@@ tr@@ ace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens onto a cr@@ ash ) and send us a good Back@@ tr@@ ace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is due to that many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the Meta @-@ info write , this is not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status De@@ activated in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . however , you can see the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that you can see in some cases up to three times on a symbol until this attitude shows their effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map . this can be shown with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may possibly remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ble Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ con@@ f so that AMAR@@ OK the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy yourself the light@@ est by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to search . please enter only one mistake , if you are looking for a bug in AMAR@@ OK . &quot;
after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; only a le@@ ere playlist . how can there be music pieces there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start was converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under extras . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed for Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are automatically calculated by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist size and select column on page . click anywhere in the new application column to select the rating for a piece . you can also use the short description of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok in the background is .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist and let them drop it exactly how to make it with other files . so easy : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , there is the button of playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably lack@@ ing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . look at li@@ b@@ ID that package contains many very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( using the right mouse button ) . also you will find it via the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; use one of the back@@ ing independent approach , therefore , the real question is supported G@@ stre@@ amer / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support as pretty every only concei@@ v@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and PNG de@@ code ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , what will be supplied in the default file ( from patent @-@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 K@@ DE , En@@ ter . &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . na ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; playing MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . check out the assistance D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the output of this command should help you search for problem @-@ ache and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
&quot; this is doing &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; already . do not forget that media first need to be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can give directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ins . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ver@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buff@@ er ( warning ; see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that l@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause dist@@ orted play@@ back . Read this bug report . see enlarge the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ Settings file .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the fast@@ ing Arts @-@ Co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts @-@ Drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine @-@ driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts @-@ buff@@ er in the control centre and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ er . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix him . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ; stor@@ ing &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; from . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . perform a register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
Read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish AMAR@@ OK before ! ) : - Download ff@@ mpe@@ g down and install it . run it in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ mpe@@ g files ( you will find the module @-@ folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it once again . run &amp; AMAR@@ OK .

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , it is already possible . place in your calendar program a alarm and let you perform with the alarm that command : d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; start playing back . make sure that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; runs before you go to bed , then you get off from the san@@ ctu@@ aries of the music you go ahead of bed . &quot;
how to know the currently in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; ongoing title if one is connected to another computer ?

&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been stored once again , the previously presented file is recorded , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ ename . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . K@@ DE &apos;s dialogue Save below is displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you save for every single project file .
&quot; clos@@ es the current project . if a project changes and still not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what happened . you can then choose between save and changes . besides , you can also stop the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; clos@@ es all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is prescribed for any non @-@ stored project , which should happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; clos@@ es all the opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project will be asked to happen , as if you were called by file . &quot;
&quot; if you can call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you drop the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project will appear directly from the upper view to the project , appear so on the added files in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b bre@@ wer ; the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project is already used . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . here you can use many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings to most of them are described above the what is the ? -@@ aid ( re@@ achable over the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ sit@@ ing CD . this is useful when you can not use files for a multi @-@ sit@@ ing CD . it is more important for you to see the medium already existing files and folder .
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this feature ver@@ an@@ be &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , import@@ ed files from the current project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it ends only the previously import@@ ed files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD Copy dialog . this enables a CD to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn just one image of a CD . you should also prefer cl@@ oning to copy you if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ects sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD Copy dialog . this allows the copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn just a picture of a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying . furthermore , the target medium does not need to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source of source in original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this enables you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens up the dialog to the formation of a DVD . with this dialog , you can create a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the cursor i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previously er@@ stell@@ ated CD @-@ Picture . the dialog as@@ ks you to a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c files are currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously er@@ stell@@ ated DVD image . the dialog as@@ ks you after a * .@@ is@@ o -@@ file as a data source , which can immediately burned down by pus@@ hing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously trained DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog box will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content , but can also be used separately . it contains information about the read video , co@@ di@@ tions and even possibilities for modi@@ fying the size and cut black ri@@ bb@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occas@@ ional medium . this information is represented in the content , and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
shows a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed out is the tool@@ bar currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is crossed , a small box is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and his activities . if this is not termin@@ ated , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , the content is displayed in the content . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media information , locking and un@@ lock of the balance . &quot;
&quot; insert the content , or off . the inhal@@ ation enables you to select and draw files into the project view . the content is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head bar in the project view is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ ers has no real function , it looks just pretty and separ@@ ates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window for change the key regulations for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can custom@@ ize the key attri@@ bution to them . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; it is necessary to set the correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the wizard rights , therefore , you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general terms can be done . nearly all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and refin@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface also , with the help of this interface can be controlled parts of the functionality for example through a Sh@@ ell@@ script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly comfortable program of K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functioning program , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which the sample programs can give you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we take that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must take advantage of that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program reported , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; presents features such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for tools of new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Audio@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ C@@ d@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ C@@ d@@ w ( cur@@ l url ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( cur@@ l url )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will receive by # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which are only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( kur@@ l url ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String Proc@@ essor , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data @-@ project , several folder and adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T @-@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ efil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is a audio @-@ CD ; -@@ read@@ able for &amp; K@@ DE ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the En@@ coder which are installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s and FL@@ AC ( comp@@ ressed air packages must be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD are read and stored in W@@ AV files on your computer ( comp@@ ressed and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then &quot;
are comp@@ ressed in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats like the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ sers have already been installed . however , it is not most likely to comp@@ ile something itself to comp@@ ile . however , it is not necessary for example FL@@ AC , its installation is not required . &quot;
which co@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format shall be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pri@@ ced factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to cop@@ ying of protected audio @-@ CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lic@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to deal with a copy of cop@@ ying . in any case , it is not possible to deal with a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ying power . simply avoid the purchase of cro@@ pped audio @-@ CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; during the entrance only once you must be done ( the arrangement dialog , however , you will be called up to a suitable configuration for reading a &amp; CD ; to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , about which you will be frequently proud of . &quot;
&quot; can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ sers programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can pick up &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby all manually is recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main windows . on the page step by step , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the internet . ) &quot;
starts the read and - if an En@@ coder is configured in the Registration of Co@@ di@@ ment settings in the alignment unit - the co@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the choice with another En@@ coder can be read as the default . it is too aware that previously the En@@ coder is configured in the registration dialog box . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , making an already selected file for the co@@ ding will instead be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; and to co@@ ding . &quot;
opens the guidelines dialog to configure the type of notifications ( such as proto@@ col@@ s ) for programs ( such as you read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
&quot; opens the main terms of dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes Ton@@ quality , co@@ di@@ sers and comp@@ ression rates and helps you in choosing the right co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to go , a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free audio format is needed . besides FL@@ AC there are also others like &apos; sh@@ ak@@ &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the low comp@@ ression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can be recover@@ ed in these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information provided by data comp@@ ression depending on their psych@@ o@@ ak@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio @-@ quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over these bit@@ rate are the differences less important as both Ko@@ di@@ erer is very good audio @-@ quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distribu@@ tions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper acid .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or one computer based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG .
&quot; MP3 - when music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car @-@ ster@@ eo@@ systems . today - initially , these devices are mostly only MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list with parameters for audio @-@ quality and resulting comp@@ ression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most musicians don &apos;t acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ ster@@ eo@@ systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps VB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex musicians and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ ster@@ eo@@ systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate approximately 5.5 . needs more 256 k@@ bps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ ster@@ eo@@ systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R shared stereo , comp@@ ression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ le . good fitting for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ eo@@ systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi @-@ ster@@ eo@@ systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information provided manually or through the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with carbohydrates programs , there are often a combination of programs for the co@@ di@@ sers and these parameters . the manual or the help of the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. around the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) add when MP@@ 3@@ s will be enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
&quot; this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Files ; parameters , which can be used ( = Kn@@ op@@ per design@@ ation in assi@@ stan@@ ts ) : &quot;
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which the persons can download the audio CDs , so that all other these information can be stored instead of the computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not an attorney . however , no one cannot prevent on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so cannot be attri@@ but@@ ed by the artist nor the music . all information can be used in a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively an app@@ enn@@ field ( use of a address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address used to be used by the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use the free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphic is needed at the next present mirror server . this saves band@@ width in the network and the load between the b@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; a visit to the page b@@ .org provides a current list of refl@@ servers for the online @-@ call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database may be downloaded or ( usually issued ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ m@@ ors that used cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading from audio @-@ CD ; see Z@@ u have to be installed first , if this is not yet to be done . &quot;
&quot; to save the output W@@ AV files can be chosen the co@@ di@@ sers , and thus add the desired file format for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FL@@ AC ( a simpli@@ fied comp@@ ression for audio data ) can be added to this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ sers . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ sers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ sers are in the chapter of the Co@@ di@@ sers .
&quot; after installation of a co@@ di@@ ers , you can get more information about its switches , as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . there must be &apos; l@@ ame &apos; replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the &amp; CD ; / DVD running on it , and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read one @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , but it is somehow still un@@ sure what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use by MP@@ 3@@ s with a VB@@ R ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , since it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files that you can naturally always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something . )
the first section covers the basic inser@@ tion of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ grap@@ her ; something which is probably done only once and
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each explo@@ iting &amp; CD . &quot;
here we define how to use Ko@@ di@@ sers to comp@@ ression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; VB@@ R 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are laz@@ y to use the program using the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will not likely to alter them at any reading a &amp; CD ; if once the right settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is transferred to the read@@ able program that you can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can read .
&quot; frequently is / dev / cd@@ rom a symbo@@ lic link to the real device @-@ record of your running gear . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is possible , it can also help the drive into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts can not be much to do . here it can be an additional conversion base . in our example everything will be as inser@@ ted as shown in the screenshot .
&quot; only with in@@ complete information please select , so you will be informed if information about the tools of samp@@ ling ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; with the Internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second instruct@@ or is easier , is found a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately connected with the database entry and the resulting list name / records or day entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example is to be considered : if you want to use all manually , so de@@ activate the options available before . however , you can use the database previously . however , the two sel@@ ections may be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following cart@@ on card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is free@@ ze for us free@@ DB . these are Settings for the data @-@ request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how to get the data about free@@ DB . put everything as it is shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we do not have downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page reports b@@ .org and look them to a mirror server located near . on this path the burden will be distributed among the b@@ ills . this setting will work as a first attempt .
&quot; both are equivalent to the server , since however many fire@@ walls protocol 88@@ 80 may be compared with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to trans@@ mit &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be able to de@@ activate the first announc@@ ing field .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer exists )
&quot; number of simultaneously release pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one same time when just an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , you can throw this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are unable to be specified in which the W@@ AV files will be useful in which the W@@ AV files will be displayed in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
&quot; all that enter as it is on the screenshot . the command is something long , under circumstances something must be put on the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio @-@ quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi @-@ ster@@ eo@@ bikes . this is a good balance between audio @-@ quality and storage power . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; tags for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the entry . ( including the full path ) and the output ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this passenger :
number of simultaneously to co@@ operating W@@ AV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than an W@@ AV file at the same time .
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it ends . this configuration is used as default for each outlet of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described as the process of le@@ ague of the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , it is described in the previous section , since we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is to be described in the previous section , the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for each trigger &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use the screen cap@@ tures , a little different from the for one &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB , you will learn how to pick up the &amp; CD ; data will be manually to pick from the internet . comments are shown on the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this passenger can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet to be done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not happening , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD were pic@@ ked up from the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled and also , the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window item , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion will be best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cru@@ ci@@ ble for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also have any local database , but the data from the internet you require the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the Tit@@ le of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screens . the title of the piece in the first line of the entry field &apos;s title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist does not have to be given in the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ p.@@ ell per piece , the comment box is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful call of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD Edi@@ tors ( e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artists , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; maximum this option is set up on the tab card and take a look at the section &apos; basic settings . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags will not be supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help to the co@@ di@@ sers to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously associated with the style of ex@@ changing CD ; this is not important because we don &apos;t trans@@ mit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the website of Check@@ lists and read the information about the categories . Pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under rock .
&quot; after the election of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window , just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields marked for the album already recorded with the given data . simply enter the item for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece to any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not be downloaded when you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already s@@ orted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album viewed via the piece list .
note that there are a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles which are so marked . a simple click on the line to choose from the piece or select the button all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces on once .
&quot; was started by clicking the button selection of the read@@ out process , so this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the tre@@ aties and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab for switching on the Princip@@ ality . it is placed in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the work@@ pieces . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window .
&quot; this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co @-@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces which were not co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have released here in the example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the initial piece of the piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the enco@@ ding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , please read and co@@ ding parallel . note the status of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the Program@@ mes has found no configuration settings to read this behavior , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . in performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem simultaneous and co@@ ding ( from however two different stages ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last titles is read , while a different piece is co@@ ded , and a dr@@ itter order in the qu@@ eu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ di@@ sers of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is enter@@ tain today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ hum@@ ane package , there is already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ package . install this package k@@ dem@@ o from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is addressed to people who compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs when it comes once more then the following is right for you :
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays displays of the different card cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read out ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked away from this somehow empty screen ( above all , if at the time of the program does not go audio @-@ CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu from ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who has reads this , pres@@ um@@ ably already started the program . it should somehow look like : &quot;
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author may not maintain this hand@@ book . it is as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Files . who also do it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you &apos;re reading this section he has rank@@ ed this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
&quot; stran@@ gely , if it has succ@@ eeded the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ mark@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; . besides others he has not added with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real release of texts also some features , the other &amp; UN@@ IX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ player . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs on &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS - and FreeBSD . it also work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support for CIS . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supported a sequence .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity each MIDI @-@ channel thanks to the lifting of the penet@@ rated keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Windows to KM@@ id can draw .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( sun@@ bathing ) . KM@@ id is determined automatically the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you stop &amp; K@@ DE ; during playing a song , KM@@ id starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer , A@@ WE , FM and GUS -@@ maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P -@@ driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; it also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of play , open it and ask the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu or fill the empty stomach . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will move it to a collection and then re@@ played by one another . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is playing , you can jump to any place by clicking the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can change on the arrows left and right of the template . to get back the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is playing , a pressure on the button break , or the removal of the menu @-@ off break in the menu copies , so the play@@ back is played while no piece is playing , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two species in a music piece . some pieces using tex@@ ture , others use lyrics , and again other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically chosen , allowing you to adjust nothing manually at the menu settings , automatically the kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected . you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event , choose from the menu settings the entries of text files or songs . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ise . these will be played by the series . in this section where you can use collections effectively .
&quot; to create a collection , open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point of organis@@ ing .... click there to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the loc@@ alization in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection comes all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application this collection will not be saved . concerns , if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is activated once a piece of opening ( using file opening or Dr@@ ag &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
&quot; if Automatic add to the collection is not activated , in the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and stored . this collection will then continue to be added to opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the song and then click Ent@@ fernen . &quot;
&quot; you can choose the order in which the songs will be played , if you choose the row after the sub@@ menu check @-@ off of menus collections , the songs are played in order how they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection of the kar@@ aoke @-@ text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu &apos; or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump around a song back , select the button Next piece , the entry record from the menu &apos; or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection of the collection and click the button of Del@@ ete . &quot;
the temporary collection can not be deleted . it does not play any role as they do when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events , which under@@ stands the syn@@ thesi@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map which makes all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Typ@@ ho@@ et Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and thus always a trumpet can be playing , when originally a piano play . &quot;
&quot; if you just have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( incl . A@@ WE - and GUS -@@ maps , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favour@@ ite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file which can save all necessary con@@ versions for the playing one piece .
&quot; each section may only appear to appear but the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . however , that every record has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
they see that def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of an interface is reached .
&quot; please send me your map file as email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard is shown . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches in the correct order are ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not leave any line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all the t@@ ints , which supports the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note using patch 127 ( Win one ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI @-@ file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the concept of Drum @-@ patch of the patch is , in which each tone is a different Per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ment ( drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not that the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( like him have some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to use like t@@ ints on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define for each channel and each instrument to define multiple key@@ maps . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to complete t@@ ints on the Per@@ cussion channel . check out as example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to dis@@ connect some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , you make it simple at CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , num@@ ber@@ ed from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; in this case the channel is used to use the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map option will naturally be defined in the file name for this channel . if you want to change the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored the patch on this channel . in this case a patch will be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for instance to always use the Per@@ man@@ sions patch on the Per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio there are multip@@ lied , in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events will be multip@@ lied with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is used , so in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ com@@ mas stand ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM there is a keyboard , that is a keyboard that will be playing with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , but some key@@ boards get higher to play at an Oc@@ t@@ ave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; return . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI @-@ Settings &quot;
the can@@ al view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ anos ( one for any MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which t@@ ints can be played .
&quot; you can also use the can@@ al view , to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is an instrument that you can choose an instrument that is no longer green but red , to view that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al view has ( until now ) two different views to view the split t@@ ints . view the view menu settings under the point of view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text , you can change it slow@@ down . to change the pace left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a musical piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same bank@@ note in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I cannot do anyone &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s main page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree that it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dr@@ ag &amp; Drop . open the folder that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
activate previously necessarily the setting automatically Add to collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can restore the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD display to slow@@ down the play@@ back . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD double .
&quot; I have to play on a &amp; K@@ DE ; working area a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Windows with my MIDI file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to hear only a file , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting automatically Add to collection , and the new ; file will add to a temporary collection of files . &quot;
&quot; take on , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . feed only just want to play the first file . so , adjust the setting automatically Add to collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection includes exactly this one MIDI @-@ file . &quot;
&quot; then join , also close to B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all cor@@ dial thanks ! if I hear these songs , or the postcard I see me that , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ros@@ a.@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I studied mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; LA@@ GA ( Spain ) I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , music do and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question to make a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ arr@@ ak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;

&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesi@@ zer , since the sound quality depend on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or a A@@ WE card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could hear a sound@@ card , except that you can of course listen to music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is needed to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; the application window is formed from so @-@ called windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed if information can be recover@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to retri@@ eve the preferred connections with the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to be played a list of entries that you should be played after each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get groups to get an additional hier@@ archy , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category and the play@@ back begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent re@@ vocation may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; km@@ player is not running out . the different files in directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player , but also by application itself . simply by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; according to the amendments from XML files , you need to be elected from the menu with playlist , and either the Edit mode , or another category will be selected . &quot;
all changes are lost when the working mode are left or selected a different group without using the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be swit@@ ched by the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation during st@@ ables and finish can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily installed . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during st@@ ables do not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated through the opening of another source . this would be disturb@@ ing in the end @-@ Animation , the user can therefore termin@@ ate the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite . &amp; lt ; img D@@ ur = &quot; thread ; &amp; lt ; img D@@ ur = &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / diam@@ onds ; &amp; lt ; / diam@@ onds ; &amp; lt ; / gt ; In the source tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; here you can set the path of the M@@ Player and the clip@@ memory size of the network and other things .
another tool to Trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the kno@@ b &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played : &quot;
Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be installed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to add the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be restored , the &amp; km@@ player has to be specified as a service provider for the M@@ IME @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the regulations of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or km@@ player ; is in a con@@ soles to start and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes occurr@@ ing within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console out of the context menu . &quot;
&quot; with this , a given back@@ drop for a specific M@@ IME type is taken ( of course only if this was also established ) , this must be done by manual modifications of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example shall PH@@ ON@@ ON give all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can be installed from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to use the scanner and the TV channels can be configured manually or the configuration file can be configured manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the user player is to use the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ int &gt; &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be selected ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contain a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support from km@@ player can be used only X@@ Video ( probably , this type of video feature is currently working on Linux . this is also only working on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this will also be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ally are used by KM@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , source scanner , TV@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin using the play@@ back of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; are there indications such as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play by him ( not by the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the command hd@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / cd@@ rom is as user root to exec@@ uting the device . thereby it is absolutely sure that / dev / cd@@ rom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for compil@@ ing &amp; k@@ ile ;
latex ; : a professional writ@@ ings application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be attri@@ but@@ ed to the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; web@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be included .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distribu@@ tions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must not read this manual , however , all the proposals for the documentation is considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or when comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; setting up for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within these one simple , direct and tailor @-@ made tools within the source of texts , and conversion tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project administration . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and his opportunities to experience , the manual should be attr@@ acted by K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with the reading of the chapters with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the right out@@ fit : lay @-@ TECH . W@@ Ã ¤ hr@@ end the opening &amp; tex ; difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( English ) can also use a La@@ ie ( English ) . a less demanding but realistic walking distance .
&quot; here only a good insight into &amp; latex ; given it is not the ultimate book for example , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Computer ; : Document P@@ repar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just like other expres@@ sions include &amp; pages ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ ational properties like paper format , Sei@@ t@@ enn@@ um@@ bers , and tex@@ ture set with the command \ \ begin { item } and needs to be closed with the command \ \ \ \ document } . &quot;
the quick cl@@ as@@ cent assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a nÃ ¼ tz@@ liche function for quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the document highlights . it can also be used to create some of the document settings .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of re@@ placing document is : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ap@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ap@@ cl &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; brochure &#93; , or custom . &quot;
enco@@ ding : hereby the time enco@@ ding of the system should be used . modern systems will increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ enco@@ ding as standard . be@@ ad should be used UT@@ F @-@ 8x ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ Documents ) .
this list may be used mostly used for additional packages . for the integration it can only be fitted out in the app@@ endix .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , written ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN @-@ regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts . &quot;
new users are not worried either . it is only a short description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the ex@@ termination of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the right ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; there is a simple problem that any mathemati@@ cal environment has not been closed . however , it will not exc@@ eed the prob@@ able appearance of output still . however , it will save you through the pro@@ visi@@ bly time and Ã © . &quot;
with automatic verification of the environments will be created when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blan@@ k ( for entering the text ) and the da@@ ve ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in men@@ Ã ¼ w ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; complete the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the highest and subtle element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective system . &quot;
&quot; in the creation of their own &amp; latex ; files can be created very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; more &#93; has been created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; &quot; source text . &quot;
a DVI ; -@@ file included a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information like the f@@ ont and is next to PDF the ex@@ haus@@ tive Edi@@ tion@@ type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and replacement of DVI ; files for different systems and sounds . &quot;
&quot; in case of using the page , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file was scr@@ at@@ ched with the editor and once an element in the DVI ; -@@ source text had been cli@@ cked , becomes an item in the &amp; latex ; &quot; source text was cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used at work with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simpli@@ fied . when using a project you can set up a project @-@ wide Master document .
&quot; fast : the &amp; latex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless any errors in the source code ) . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ ing space : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file is based on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ ts@@ â , and it is not a call of &amp; Oc@@ ular ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; in the cont@@ ex@@ ation of the work @-@ tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ om@@ es should be stri@@ cted . the selection of common elements have been developed into the document . the first selection of document is designed in parts , chapters , sections , ... Reg@@ ulations for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection of more information is available for the introduction of articles such as keywords , fu@@ gues , fu@@ els or references . the negoti@@ able possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or different element is created . &quot;
reference : will be used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a sel@@ ection@@ box ) .
&quot; when using it , a selection list with liter@@ ary entry is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; they are only necessary when the file is necessary to a project . for the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection of the field will be used for defining the f@@ ails . it enables the main text , which will be specified . it can be defined , etc . there are the following f@@ ails : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two expres@@ sions for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and fes@@ tive the settings . the document may be written by hand on hand . &quot;
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ \ Docum@@ enta contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; places the f@@ ont . will not be fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source text files must be compiled , the easi@@ est way to this is compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of the men@@ Ã ¼ s or the button . &quot;
the source text must be stored prior to comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage automatically .
&quot; closing the comp@@ ile of the document , should be chosen in the log@@ ging after errors . in use of fast @-@ construction should be started &amp; Oc@@ ular ; this is not the case , should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an area ( English environment ) is a text , which is different from the remaining document . this command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Slov@@ ak , and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . ( English ) . ( English ) . &quot;
the people will only be within the environment ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no separ@@ ati@@ fication ( number ) for the Ã © .
&quot; there are many possibilities for suppl@@ ying the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it enables you to add certain fon@@ ts , fat pres@@ sures , etc . these commands either with the command \ \ \ end or automatically at the end of the area . &quot;
\ \ begin { E@@ MP@@ H } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is as long as garden@@ er until he is closed with a \ \ \ E@@ MP@@ H } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ E@@ MP@@ H { word } cur@@ si@@ v .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ begin { rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing of the source code , it was represented by the source , now a step @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in assi@@ stan@@ ts have been given a bit of text , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . this should be mind@@ . a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ ves and a po@@ em to apply to see the differences in these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , can be back using the editor or Str@@ g E back to the editor ( with internal vie@@ wers ) . with an external vie@@ wers must be closed to its windows . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; -@@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script : / PDF file . simply try and put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; D e V ice I n@@ s. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; jud@@ gement ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ issue as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ conver@@ ters or computer screen . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - after the Click DVI - can then printed the document using a file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
the tool@@ bar complete the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; latex ; file text created can begin the conversion into cu@@ red other formats using the dum@@ pl@@ ings in the tool@@ bar .
the Next hunt for a direct le@@ ap of the editor for an easy position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; tex@@ tual files . this needs to be used only Modern under Settings C@@ ile ... Tools Bau@@ en .
&quot; in order to search the Next page , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source code and ex@@ clude on Next . the jump to the appropriate position in the DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers will be done so . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; it takes place with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; the document of &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ orge and on the corresponding line . this must be set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used as a Tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; should the use of fast @-@ up of &amp; DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers do not have a fault , this should be an error , this is displayed in the log@@ ging file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log@@ s file , the error can be used in the source text . in the editor it is always the line to be used in which the error appears . the log@@ ging line will appear to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty row . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document . the afor@@ emen@@ tioned possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; in selecting the document , a document can either be written either from scr@@ atch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
suitable users of &amp; latex ; use mostly the same introduction for almost all documents . templates enables you to store and loaded in order to make the creation of a new document .
&quot; to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / jud@@ gement ; -@@ file can be created or create a new file by means of an existing document and select a file template from document . &quot;
when creating a new document from a template using file New will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string enco@@ ding ) . this variables enables you to set up settings in settings ...
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which string chains will be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this time string is replaced by input in document class . typically they will be used by input in document class . typically $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assi@@ stan@@ ts and that of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way .
when creating a new document can then be downloaded the own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal Editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a Tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor for programmers with the in@@ compatibility of the read@@ ings and Her@@ vor@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; enables you to be done in men@@ Ã ¼ rich tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and his lyrics , the manual should be attr@@ acted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; enables you to begin with the reading of the chapters with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; jud@@ gement ; -@@ command reference , which can be called for the men@@ Ã ¼ ller La@@ Te@@ X reference . it can be accessed by means of all commands , which can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ clicking with penet@@ rated Str@@ g button to select the &amp; tex ; -@@ word does not affect the clicking \ \ par of \ \ pur \ \ big@@ ski@@ p merely \ \ pur .
when drawing the text with penet@@ rated mouse button the selected text is automatically copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated speed key to place parts of the source window in the Edit window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to search the different types of source texts , and to bl@@ ame them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are high@@ lighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assi@@ stan@@ ts enables you to place an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ile work , or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . this is also high@@ lighted , so that it is automatically ex@@ changed during the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; working is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; special functions for writing a &amp; latex ; special commands : for their choice . under Edit the following commands for tex@@ ture are also included : &quot;
W@@ Ã ¤ t a complete paragraph ( group of rows that contain on both sides a le@@ ak row ( like in other Tex@@ te@@ dit@@ oren ) . this extended meaning will not dis@@ close ( such as in other Tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended meaning will not be separated .
&quot; the word under the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position from . this selection has also an extended meaning , because this command also &amp; jud@@ gement ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a request ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) . &quot;
&quot; for example of a part of the document may result in exc@@ ess of this first , and through Dr@@ Ã ¼ o C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands , with your own commands , the following commands may contain the following commands : &quot;
removed a complete article . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing paragraph .
&quot; it was already confirmed , that environments a central role in &amp; latex ; for this reason it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands to provide easy work with &amp; latex environment . &quot;
with this command the current position is placed on the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the arrival of the environment .
with this command the current position is set to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the structure .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { area } is located to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of tr@@ apped environments , you can get lost any of the people . this command will con@@ clude that this command will not dis@@ close surroundings , so that the tr@@ apped ambi@@ tion structure does not dis@@ closed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands , which correspond to the surrounding area . &quot;
with this command the current position is placed on the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the depth of the brack@@ et .
with this command the current position is placed on the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the sl@@ ed cl@@ as@@ ks .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the inaugur@@ ation brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many w@@ ast@@ ated groups @-@ cl@@ amps can be lost quickly the way . this command will con@@ clude , so that the most recently opened structure of &amp; tex ; -@@ groups not dis@@ appeared . &quot;
in &amp; latex ; two simple alignment is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; be used . &amp; k@@ ile ; does this case and for two con@@ fin@@ ation thereof .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double quotes can be installed under Settings C@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and trained .
it can also be used to use L@@ Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and therefore either German or French acc@@ umulation . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; on the wir@@ ing of Shi@@ ft ; initi@@ ation &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ shot . if the current position is located within a Listen -@@ environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example , &amp; k@@ ile ; not only one item , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables in the area f@@ ails &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close center@@ ed quar@@ ry .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ dest@@ ined &amp; jud@@ gement ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this enables you to add cat@@ ching ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users compl@@ ain the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) sub@@ ordin@@ ate to each other . although this tab@@ ulator is not to be er@@ ased . although this tab@@ ulator is not the da@@ ve , for the sp@@ old position of the current tab@@ ulators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already has been expanded this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands , it was added three according to your needs and the other two are for setting up different working methods . all these modes can be set up with settings on settings ... verification . &quot;
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { area } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ \ { environment } after an empty row ( for the text ) .
&quot; when the back is the last letter is the last letter , the entry is removed and allows you to complete the complete list of the complete list . on the other hand , the list may be ad@@ minist@@ ered by input of another letter too . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively you can choose from &amp; k@@ ile ; also j@@ umps into these positions by means of machin@@ ed spra@@ yers N@@ Ã ¤ te jump@@ ing . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set @-@ up ... k@@ ile ; comp@@ ile settings for these lists will be done . it enables you to use different gro@@ om@@ eters &amp; tex ; - and &amp; jud@@ gement ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ne@@ sting of general voice @-@ use .
the command mode is for complete the complete range of environments not accumulative ) and the call of the complete mode will have a gro@@ o@@ ded list with ambi@@ tion mode will have a gro@@ ove list with ambi@@ tion mode . on the other hand the environments will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for a complete mode .
&quot; in the call of the complete range , the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ile environment , the command is automatically folded and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambi@@ ent appears on the easi@@ est way and through wir@@ ing the input key will be finished . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the surrounding area is automatically closed . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item -@@ command with installed . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set @-@ up ... k@@ ile ; galvan@@ ized settings to these lists are used . this mode uses the complete range of the complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; highlight user @-@ defined lists of b@@ oll@@ ing chains , which is immediately replaced by lung housing . as an example of a menu list . as an example , this list may be called examp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is given in the letter , and the word stru@@ ck for complete dism@@ ant@@ ling or the keyboard short@@ cut or the keyboard short@@ cut + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the string chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
Gro@@ Ã ³ e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ anc@@ cher are not helpful . however it was noted that many whal@@ es were written in a document more than once . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete range for all already written .
&quot; this mode can be set in men@@ Ã ¼ at@@ tire settings ... K@@ ile En@@ complete . here , can also be determined the sw@@ elling for the indication of the complete control system . &quot;
the complete file you can place at the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / bell@@ y / mode / by the personal Home folder . mode is available for ( abbrevi@@ ation ) or tex .
the dialog graphics simpli@@ fy the introduction of graphics as simple as possible . to ex@@ haus@@ tive care of the foundations for the graphics formats should be the sections and be observed .
PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF file files , but also provide an excellent basis for Ã © . the PDF -@@ output will be elimin@@ ated and then be converted to a PDF file and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to place the result of labour , needs to be compiled in the source code . all Bau@@ tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ Ã ¼ s create comp@@ ile , creating change and create view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ ile of the source for vie@@ wers like &amp; Oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be used the key element with Alt ; 3 times , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file is converted into a PS file , and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS -@@ file . &quot;
&quot; in case of using the command , it is normally called a viewer after comp@@ ile . should not be used in an integrated spect@@ ator , so each time will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will notify the ment@@ or project new project .... here the following information for the project is asked :

first must be said that the output environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; &amp; latex ; is a right system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of other packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&quot; &amp; web@@ ex ; and &amp; lyrics live ; are delivered with many documents . it includes a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; latex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; a complete re@@ remote re@@ fern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and sein@@ e@@ â ( a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is ideal for the search for a particular form@@ atting . since it is a very cru@@ de document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; pac@@ ex ; / lyrics , is not always easy . as possible assistance , the small application tex@@ tured to provide a database with all the &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and here for a graphical rul@@ er . &quot;
all documents are structured in categories and the gray advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or keywords . from &amp; k@@ ile ; will only be the results shown .

&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; lau@@ det , have been able with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even if you can benefit from the additional functionality and do not need to wait until someone can benefit the tissue in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; and the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more information can be found below . &quot;
to install a plugin or part to a part , we start with the menu plugins . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add new . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins is used without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the addi@@ tions of the plug @-@ ins .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the Nickname of the user and serves to unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project like both team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project leader .
&quot; the user can choose from the list of the members of the team members , who he is . this happens as express@@ es the team member from the list and use the button as express@@ es . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) will appear f@@ ett after you are : text . &quot;
top names and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information .
next to the overview of her team there is another advantage by the recording of members of the team : it may be created an event for information to the team@@ leader when something specific happens . see for further information .
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed if something certain in the project is happening . an example would be able to re@@ mark the opening of the opening and closing a message when a file is secured , or a script that will add a file into CV@@ S when it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
on the page event configuration of the Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project Project intro@@ duct@@ ory Dialog@@ es can be edited and deleted .
&quot; an e @-@ mail will be sent to the recipi@@ ents in the recipient of the recipi@@ ents . the Ad@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , wei such lad@@ der will be established . &quot;
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
note is simple . it may be chosen either the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keywords followed in a commentary box followed by remarks k@@ mark text .
&quot; note may be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @-@ leader of the team member state shall be a role in the project from the following possibilities : team@@ leader sub@@ project manager to the enrich@@ ment and sub@@ project leader should be assess@@ ed as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; name and roll names are independent of major or small @-@ off , but space around the stap@@ les and the : make the note of inv@@ ali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scri@@ pt@@ ing and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ TD agnos@@ is , and web@@ based form@@ atting , and scri@@ pt@@ ing languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the menu menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings treat , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can set up by settings of qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that will be treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including auto @-@ completion may be modified . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ write of tags : large / small @-@ writing of automatically incorpor@@ ated tags . normal size / small check@@ er means that the tags are described as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small @-@ write of attri@@ bu@@ ten : large / p@@ unch of automatically inser@@ ted attri@@ butes , the attri@@ butes means to be described as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inser@@ ted . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except for easy tags .
&quot; - and connecting @-@ day automatically update : if cancelled , the appropriate day will be am@@ ended and vice versa . &quot;
automatic set of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of ak@@ zent@@ u@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during the utter@@ ing .
M@@ IME @-@ Types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default Standard play@@ back the standard releases can be recover@@ ed .
Standard character enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created or in other way as with file opening @-@ open files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . this setting here is loaded from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded .
&quot; Standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . this setting here is loaded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that at an electricity or cr@@ ash in the next start of the program the document can be recover@@ ed from this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for not saved documents a backup is regularly updated , according to the specified period . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the Edit range or a separate view ( or the documentation in a folder ) , what it is possible to view the documentation and source text at the same time . &quot;
use the window settings at the default back next to the next start is useful when the user interface have come through changing the MDI @-@ modes and do@@ cking of views . it corresponds to --@@ res@@ et@@ layout Command parameters .
the War@@ n@@ shire area serves the taxes of the possibility to stop the display of war@@ nings by an@@ ho@@ oks of no longer .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchroni@@ zation of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . with regard to the different modes see .
here the Par@@ ser and the structuring of the structure of the Par@@ ser @-@ knot@@ s in the document can be adjusted in details .
&quot; in the field of mouse click on the structuring of the structure , it is possible to change through stimulation of the structure using the mouse button with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural adjustment , the visibility of knot@@ s can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree will be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are found in the empty field in the text , while le@@ ans groups are not found in the current document no element was found . &quot;
&quot; the area for the establishment of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be dis@@ closed in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation something else means than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins are managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications of dr@@ itter page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most popular &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must include the following : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will pass the plugin starting at the start , so it can open the current file to open the folder ( path of the current file ) or the project ord@@ ner . &quot;
component in the &quot; Only @-@ lung &quot; mode load : check whether the plugin is den@@ ied the shop . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts is usually not selected when this option is not selected .
&quot; audi@@ ting the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is right . pick @-@ up , if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it is later installed . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the deb@@ ug@@ ging was completely new . • Support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was put out , as well as the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of its deb@@ ug@@ ger has been implemented , the various Im@@ plement@@ ations about plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; He@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add . &quot;
the use of deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with selecting a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug in the project settings . with the options options beside the deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin op@@ tionally you can change the specific settings .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated for a project some additional items in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of over@@ wo@@ ven variables is displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
&quot; view , in which all brack@@ et points , with z@@ eil@@ ings and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output is shown ( as shown in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the bottom do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , made , or she shares the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ce . this action is opened by default , so that in the normal case it has to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te session . clos@@ es the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or ends the Lau@@ ght@@ er according to requirements .
send a HTTP requirements to the server for a deb@@ ug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the view deb@@ ug@@ ger version .
&quot; points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the currently out of the current variables , the execution will be continued during the script , the execution will be continued until the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without information on wo@@ ven variables and the current interest number , the execution continues . happens before a deb@@ ut place , the execution will begin as soon as a requirement . &quot;
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script without giving the functions or includes flights .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script where possible into functions and includes into faul@@ ty .
&quot; pro@@ ves the deb@@ ug@@ ger to over@@ pass the directive and go to the next , when there would be the current one . &quot;
opens a dialog that can be monit@@ ored in which a variable or an expression can be monit@@ ored ; the monit@@ ored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can set a variable or set a new value of variable .

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; document type of Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills as well as &amp; CSS ; to give . you allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; abilities , how to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ ers @-@ languages and family 2 , the script and &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the day @-@ folder and the tool@@ bar ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions get faster into a document as a user ever could . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how long @-@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; B p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attri@@ butes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Self @-@ volume , the &amp; blan@@ ch@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; themselves . tools allow for a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of a writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; u@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the compl@@ aint language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 ( ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and bound@@ aries is shown in simple way .
this is the root element of a day@@ XML document . it can only be used in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains only as only element guy over itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the day of class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type of Meth@@ od . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute and the attri@@ butes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day is determined . this is a single element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only determine the name and type of attri@@ bute . additionally it contains more tags to describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element element .
returns the texts used for the attri@@ butes for the attri@@ butes in the day Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p metho@@ dology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an inter@@ val and a metho@@ dology . the arguments that can be transferred to the method . can be empty or a day name % , this means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attri@@ bute only once . it is a only element type element .
places the position of the attri@@ bute of a tags within a dialog box . this day can only occur for each attri@@ bute ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present every field in dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the tags . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; -@@ decre@@ ased : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be saved and closed .
&quot; space signs nothing but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; windows to start and over@@ check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the review is only available in loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; Sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Trans@@ la@@ de function described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; function &quot; &quot; function &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; B p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just pretty simple and there is an editor for it , re@@ achable over D@@ TD settings . this can di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; u@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of the D@@ TD ( html 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not indicated , the name is used as a Nickname . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... click on New promotion leads to the same dialogue :
this promotion will be assigned to the keyboard short@@ cut . with click the button user can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be included in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action this text is inser@@ ted in the document to the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the powerful shar@@ p game . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts ) , but it is not limited to use the document or use as an input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick@@ start -@@ dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first must be the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although skilled paths are allowed , it is recommended that % scri@@ pt@@ ing variables in the command line , such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ um / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ str . this way is trying &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following places : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file will be removed from the name name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process is replaced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique to the P@@ ID number is useful when D@@ CO@@ P to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by external script is used . &quot;
the parameters for this event usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script can accept a script from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at the default input . you can send what to send to default . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input vari@@ able is usually useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the finished application can be re@@ directed . there are two types edition : normal output , which is directed to the default section ; error messages written to the standard edition text , by the value the selection of the output is scheduled to be set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the market language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . in given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate tools .
&quot; complete everything and if the day attri@@ butes , and you plan their use , activate dialogue &quot; &quot; Day &quot; , &quot; if available , so that an input for using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is the an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; choose graphics other programs ( or where else is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; used by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixel , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the aff@@ le symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a laun@@ ching as a symbol . through the use of green ( green , usually interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to be sign@@ alized that click on this symbol ; -@@ day in the current document will be inser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol it must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the use button and put them with other tags , so there is still what there , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
sup@@ pose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar supplement or it should be shared with a better overview of several tr@@ ays in multiple groups . open the tools on settings tools . make sure that the desired tool is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the tr@@ omin@@ ator ( whole left above ) for my work@@ pieces . after the selection of the item , which is to be added to the tool@@ box , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
I would like to add a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
&quot; please note , as the gest@@ ation support the group@@ ing support . someone who knows my work@@ pieces could not know that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tools must be tested through pro@@ clam@@ ation of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; secure in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right file . please adjust their work@@ pieces ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder ( s ) , if a file will be opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scri@@ pt@@ ing language or the Form@@ ati@@ ing language you may most like this chapter . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; Document@@ ary tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository if anyone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc . if you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ figur@@ ing file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the D@@ Oc@@ um@@ entation Section 2 = # Sec@@ tions Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.html ... &#91; Cont@@ ext &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.html ... &#91; Cont@@ ext &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.html ... &#91; Cont@@ ext &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 1 = 67@@ 2.@@ 3.html ... &#91; Cont@@ ext &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 1 = 67@@ 2.@@ 3.html ... &#91; Cont@@ ext &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 1 = 67@@ 2.@@ 2.html &quot;
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ...
&quot; note the # before getting started and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess letters ( except by reason ) , md@@ ash ; but try it yourself . &quot;
you remember that the content is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and is consequ@@ ent at the top end of the construction supervision &amp; md@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eien .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help would be displayed correctly . by using the function called and Dr@@ aps from C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by also separated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share , and after $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you put this in your file do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best Web@@ Develop@@ ment@@ form . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; are you not alone . it is possible to divi@@ de resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise whom will send us an email menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) ship with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them as correct and useful for the release . to make an us@@ eless contribution to make an us@@ eless contribution to make the source of resources , both for our team and for the future users . &quot;
&quot; when uplo@@ ading you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key for their private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case you have to have a look . in the dialog Neue resource , you have to stay a complete file ( URL Pre@@ view can be empty ) and with click OK the uplo@@ ading can be started . &quot;
&quot; the uplo@@ ading can upload by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) uplo@@ ading tool , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , studied &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the ir@@ reconc@@ iliation of the resource by checking the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it can then be broken . if the integrity given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it may be necessary to work by a D@@ TE@@ P package . there is the sim@@ pl@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD file in a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD store and Convert a D@@ TD file . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that will be used . afterwards the following dialog :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tive line : the string chain that exists in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will appear
&quot; enemies of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; according to the transformation of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this to understand and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter seeks to take them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the work@@ space in three areas divided : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . it is available as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administr@@ ators different work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are available each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements provide a personal collection of Web@@ Develop@@ ers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user list so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be everything by &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to work with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the construction views , the cartridges with information and the tools . please do in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; one can click on the cart@@ on with the right mouse button to get a cont@@ context menu with the current documentary , to load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ ment lead to another context menu regarding the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing of the word under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file , if the string chain can be called under the mouse po@@ inter a file . &quot;
at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers there is the tool@@ bar of the editor . at the present time &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further out@@ lines of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tools are adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs .
&quot; the use of the tool is really easy . if they want to insert one day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; then click on the icon , which has inser@@ ted that day , then you can insert the data for this straight , then click on , you can fill in a dialog fields . &quot;
&quot; construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to open in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navig@@ ate them to open and to gr@@ asp them . in the presentation with boxes stand for files , project , scripts , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provision . this view shows all the files in the project using right@@ ed mouse click . actions like add , remo@@ ving , uplo@@ ading or del@@ e@@ tion of files from the storage media can be performed with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programming parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information on the available scri@@ pt@@ ing languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and project also works here . through the right mouse button you can get the available information on a script via the right mouse button , such as the script to start , edit or send an e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of the item , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element@@ ary . thanks to the right @-@ clicking , a list of commands to navigation and re@@ fres@@ hing the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other construction finishes . with it a quick attri@@ butes and nam@@ ics change . it allows modification of all available attri@@ butes with a few mouse cli@@ cks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided by the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentary site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be assess@@ ed and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cartridges at the bottom of the window can be reached via the actual information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on provides information about each in Qu@@ anta running script , e.g. the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this cartridges indicates all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; parts are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the Chocolate &apos;s tool is the possibility to define own command as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to define . &quot;
a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the work@@ pieces as a comp@@ act@@ ory table archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they can get a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail ; how to secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable when you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files can be transferred to your system . it has a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . the options are easy to understand and not run here .
&quot; if you have problems with the species of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a Web @-@ development tool for K@@ DE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; the editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; actually it would be when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , expand@@ able Mark@@ up @-@ languages would be ? well , this would make him an absolute greatest Web @-@ development tools for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; is now limited to a general and comprehensive web development tool , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it should be the suitable &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; well , to the above mentioned needs to be determined that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why people has developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; ru@@ m@@ ors is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows Web@@ developers to increase the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity dram@@ atically . through the program compil@@ ers they can have &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ( more about it , they find in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web @-@ level environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a quick web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and manufactured a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric Laf@@ ay@@ on sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file which is not located , with the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . you should try to store the selected file / text outside of the local / project leader , will be reported only an error . &quot;
&quot; Convert to the inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board there , included special characters to the &amp; HTML ; used , so that they are correct and not understood by the browser as a form@@ att@@ ending instruction . &quot;
• Convert the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; the procedure which is the correct way to insert special characters and space in &amp; URL ; s is . first line for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the an@@ chor @-@ day .
swit@@ ched the block@@ age or out . that permits you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste .
go directly to a cell phone number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error can be found !
seeks a string chain or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the news window or not an . that is the window where you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
- and switching of the problem of problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main object . the problem is activated once you changes to the structuring .
shows the tool@@ box left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries &quot; Next or neighbour@@ hoods , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; search@@ es the project directory for new files , which could be there . this enables , e.g. graphics files in your project folder or a sub@@ folder to copy and then add to the project . &quot;
load files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and whether you have downloaded an additional input / output module ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects can be found in detail . &quot;
&quot; loads a project @-@ tool @-@ same . these are preserved in project @-@ ups / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned to this project . &quot;
a dialog to save your tools . allows you to select the type of the tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tools . this creates only the name . actions must be added by means of settings . tools are saved and you are asked when you want to store the tool@@ bar if you want to store the tool@@ bar .
&quot; remo@@ ving a tool@@ bar out of the sight . if you do not have the hard disk . if you are not saved by the hard disk . if you are not saved , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own tools to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is open in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows the uplo@@ ading of tools on the main server , where everybody else can access it . see in . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anything else has done and convert in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own auth@@ orization .
&quot; loading / auff@@ eur of the En@@ tit@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TD ; is useful when the En@@ tit@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; ren@@ ew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P is not present , f@@ ails to f@@ ails the shop . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are available in the current work@@ pieces . if the Standard ( HTML ; ) tool is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day entry dialog , if there is one there . this entry is always present , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion means by means of tool@@ bar , if this day is reflected in this place to the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu score . ank@@ ook enabled them . click on a activated plug @-@ ins .
choose the syn@@ ist mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ vor@@ ad@@ schem@@ ata depends on der@@ c@@ ate ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of z@@ eil@@ ing identifier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
the syntax of current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switch between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions within the K@@ DE libraries , the switching times can need or un@@ beautiful graphics mode , which is also the default mode , which is also the default mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and sooner . &quot;
additionally this menu for each open window display an entry . with selection of an entry is activated the appropriate sub@@ window .
out@@ dated the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main windows .
&quot; the changes in this dialog may use every application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers . &quot;
establ@@ ishes the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog will be shown in which you can delete items from the tool@@ bar or how to add and modify the sequ@@ ences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely lic@@ enced , but as with any open source project , the developers always want to use assistance . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the best from top to bottom because after the dischar@@ ging of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically completed . all these paths and author information may later be set later with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project features can be adjusted .
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name is automatically filled file . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the Server@@ address of the machine , to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ fil@@ e.@@ tv ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; leaves this field empty , the default settings of the selected log log is used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer could be a adaptation necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder that are stored in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should instead be set to the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder that are stored in which the tool is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should instead be set to the standards . &quot;
this allows to add files from the local file system to the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you want to download and change it . at server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; do@@ cked when files will be integrated somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is newly started , not h@@ aken . &quot;
with this option all files and folder will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of voucher .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can choose the desired files by filling or , by remo@@ ving the here@@ tic , cli@@ ps from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assi@@ stan@@ ts contains three settings that lets your work simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or with the keyboard short@@ cut Shi@@ ft . F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assi@@ stan@@ ts and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( wild@@ card possible ) which can be read in project @-@ related operations such as Project ord@@ ner .
&quot; supplement@@ ary option to the top , even files which are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded with the opening of the project . in this context can be read more about proj@@ ections .
&quot; with this , the deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be set in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the options options . in this case the deb@@ ug@@ ging is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high @-@ la@@ the profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a buil@@ ders for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing its own construction supervision for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project management can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of event , you can add event actions and add these actions to change or delete them . event actions are executed , as if a before certain event occurs , such as the Sich@@ er of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour can be currently not influence . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open out of the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed the project file automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there can be the files in the current project .
&quot; folders are likewise , however the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right mouse button @-@ able context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see .
enables the remo@@ ving of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will end up to prevent the remo@@ ving . &quot;
the password will keep in the core store and forgotten when does not forget . this option is useful when most common uplo@@ ading files are needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the plate store -@@ option does not appear in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you can change your opinion before uplo@@ ading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high la@@ ils profiles are created and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) will be uploaded to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog will display : &quot;
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for uplo@@ ading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and N@@ FS .
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator establ@@ ishes a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . the password will be stored on the plate so it can not be read , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. through simple exchange of view can be loaded various files and tools and replace the currently opened files and tools . &quot;
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , re@@ achable via settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the working method .
&quot; as above mentioned above , the tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best deals with the menu tool@@ bar . use and add items . the add tool is treated in the section of adding tools . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols may be adjusted either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , there can be other actions like tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar can be set in dialogue where actions can be clearly visible , which actions are visible on this or other tools . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context of the context of an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will additionally remove the entries in action and action edited the self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tools and set settings .
&quot; templates are in essential documentation , code @-@ Schnit@@ zel and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates generally such as a usually file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any system into existing folder into the pre @-@ gas@@ kets . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you can refer to the file system . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use , please read the conditions at the beginning of each template made conditions prior to use . &quot;
&quot; bin@@ ary is all that not pur@@ ple text is . it can be used any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary text are inser@@ ted in documents using templates src = / src / url ) . some examples can be found in advance via global templates . further information on templates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates can be created new documents in appropriate sub@@ folders . you will be a simple sc@@ af@@ fold for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples can be found in advance via global templates . see for more information on the Templates tree .
&quot; these kinds of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is always attached to the documents on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . some examples can be found in the prevention of global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a comp@@ ressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a documentary structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once the happen is , notice that ( although it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pres@@ i@@ baum under project templates . &quot;
choose text in your document and click on file as a template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively the selection can easily be drawn with brow@@ sing and draw on the construction template .
&quot; the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a pre @-@ gas@@ oline engines . it can be used to use all file management functions , so about civ@@ ilians and dis@@ connect or inser@@ ting through the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select a folder right on the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default , however , it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
project requirements allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or with them . additionally you can keep some things while using templates in projects very profound .
the leading structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of tanks like above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , in the pre @-@ session overview with the right mouse button on the folder and in the context menu Properties . the following dialogue will be published : &quot;
&quot; a selection of the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is pic@@ ked up , as soon as the El@@ ter@@ restri@@ al attri@@ butes is raised . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the stem cells in the pres@@ cription . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless they would be explicitly activated . if nothing appears in case of a normal folder . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; allowed or edited text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ ers , and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and enables cop@@ ying content into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that are available via the menu View . the first mode re@@ places the source code in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : he will load a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch if necessary changes in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document , that &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ its of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still necessary to edit the source code . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is exactly like the first , except that at the same time , changes both in the source code and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ chr@@ on is activated , this mode is already active , puts the active cursor back from a window to the other , whereby the position in the document is ret@@ ained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor lets you set off through synchroni@@ zation after a click or automatically select . basically the recommendation applies : a small sp@@ anne for fast calcul@@ ators and a large sp@@ anne for slow .
sup@@ pose you want to change the title of the website so it is possible to choose the title of the Website . this makes the processing of un@@ visible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; Editor will also be created . this is used to change a new document with the V@@ PL ; it is used to change the reduction of the pad@@ ding co@@ di@@ ver . this makes it possible to change the following :
Meta @-@ tags permit the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Meta @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons down . a click into the list allows modification of content , e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword . keyword 2 on the content of the column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing part of pages in your browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as with the Meta @-@ elements possible . working by CSS Rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS styles by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by filling with the paths , possible . under rare circumstances the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be installed as usual . text can be installed by inser@@ ted or remove it by means of taste or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags will be done in the same way over the work@@ pieces , as in the source text editor , it is said that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if a an@@ chor day , surrounded by text is necessary to be removed any other ren@@ ker day . &quot;
some work@@ pieces like the tables of tables or the lists are de@@ activated . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; this release must be used to tables or list of items .
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining handles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements possible and the execution of the styles can be pursu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; still the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ vest@@ sl@@ t and li@@ b@@ xml , which are already available with a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE . &quot;

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g determined the full path from a fil@@ ename without paths . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the top p@@ article con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is for example a for@@ es@@ pres@@ sur@@ at@@ ei .. / en / x@@ sl@@ do@@ c.@@ x@@ sl is the following input possible :
&quot; in this command will be checked for partial or complete compliance with a pre @-@ name called Q@@ N@@ AME or a specified modules . &amp; eg ; template is right with each Q@@ N@@ AME , which contains the string chain template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; &quot; Q@@ N@@ AME &quot; &quot; will be extended by the rules offered by the X@@ SL source file names s@@ ind@@ . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 will be &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a ques@@ tion@@ able point has to be resolved for related UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ way@@ s.@@ . this will be executed automatically after the loading of the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . preser@@ ving points will be re@@ checked shortly after the start of a every passage .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me just why I wrote .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the respon@@ ding many changes made and correct@@ ed at the same time a lot of jobs had changed . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in the conflict .
&quot; the program used by me , but I coul@@ dn &apos;t see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there were no notes on the places where you may just changed the obj@@ ection . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small album . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later there were still added any amount of useful functions .
&quot; if you want to compare an example fast text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way assem@@ bling is fully supported . this is useful when two persons works independently of one piece of co @-@ changes and changes the original file . in this editor lets you edit the result even directly . the screenshot shows three qu@@ ell files when comp@@ eting :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; will also help you with the compar@@ ative and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when the folder exec@@ uting :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and prove that the possibilities of active color monit@@ ore . if you have to check out co @-@ operation you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tobacco are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at the summary on the left side . ( no trouble will change if Jem@@ and the ind@@ em@@ ing changes . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then shows the colour in which file is different . red color means that both these files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can facilitate the ti@@ pping work by clicking the fil@@ ename of the first file . &quot;

&quot; the Open dialog allows the manual of fil@@ ename , selecting over the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the off@@ set list . you do not specify the third file ; if you have no third file , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ ative or assem@@ bling of folders , used for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if compil@@ ing is complete , the entry field is active and can be edit . however , it is not necessarily required to set immediately a output file . you can get this step later on Save . &quot;
the insert button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / mer@@ ge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose tex@@ tures from the clip@@ board into the active comparison table . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog you will not have any files you can easily connect to the cr@@ ash button .
you can also use points and use : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file is like for example several similar features . if you want to find out these functions , it would have only two relevant files to upload it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now and then you can compare the relevant sections just copy , paste and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can not pull out nothing of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the tr@@ ash can be supported by text into a comparison table .
warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the target and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of cop@@ ying and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each source window , the info of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the cell number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C option is optional . ) Je@@ de Info @-@ line has to rest a while over the line . then a small auxili@@ ary window will display the full name . &quot;
&quot; the three taxes figures are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is being recognized , one sees at the color , which file is different . if both files differ in the at@@ titudes ) . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color sch@@ ema is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s going to see in the next section ( compilation ) . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column contains the appropriate color . in some programming languages the colour will not be so important . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in string chains and comments , relevant for pre@@ processor and in a few , rare single situations . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separ@@ ates the mer@@ ge column of text , will not be activated in places where the respective source file has no lines . if the z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ break is activated , the line will be dot@@ ted on um@@ bled lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the compar@@ ative issue ) has also a info @-@ line with the ins@@ cription issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; continue &#93; when you have finished the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons for next dis@@ solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ es are used , each difference can also be solved at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the window , the group was displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will not be visible . ( this group will then be shown the current group . it will be high@@ lighted by the color background color for current range , and on the left a black beams appears . &quot;
&quot; sometimes through the automatic mer@@ ging or by manual work , no additional line is left in the group ; then this is just a space for the case that you can change your opinion , and perhaps again a different source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you may copy and paste it . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; compilation attached ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if when selecting the sources the options numbers ign@@ ore or ign@@ ant C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments may also be treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ated mainly with the picture of the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard on the left , right , high , end , page , right , right , at the beginning , Str@@ g @-@ start and str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ saf@@ er column can be used through to navig@@ ate also . &quot;
in Aug@@ us@@ ef@@ ile you can also use other buttons for working . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between deposits and pres@@ cription mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion of the entry . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the abstr@@ acts columns synchroni@@ ze the view of all windows on the start of the respective group ( as already in the section summar@@ izing and the edi@@ table expression has been explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference ( shr@@ g @-@ down / str@@ g @-@ picture down ) or to the next / vor@@ ced un@@ solved conflict with the manual continues to be seen as a conflict . therefore must be dis@@ solved between un@@ solved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to copy the clip@@ board , you need to copy the cop@@ ying ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g paste ) . be careful about this option , but be careful about this option but you could over@@ write so the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored according to the relevant operating system . Unix flav@@ or use a cell @-@ feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 reserves the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ tex \ \ r \ . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 is not keeping the condition files that you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ ary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and re@@ produced in the next start . ( menu settings ) - &gt; K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 are set up ... )
&quot; choose a f@@ ont with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also puts writ@@ ings with adjust@@ . width to choose from , you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are presented in cur@@ si@@ ver scrip@@ tures . if the chosen script does not support this presentation , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed automatically . on these systems , the button is automatically an un@@ loaded colour . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the socket of the tab@@ ulator button is inser@@ ted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a tab@@ ulator is inser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if you express entry or return , the inser@@ tion of the line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection will be copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which c@@ eil@@ ing type you prefer . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; at the compar@@ is@@ ons of files trying &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files will be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step the white sign will not be ignored . even when compil@@ ing white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some Edi@@ tors ( in some systems ) save a part of &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ tex &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then they may only be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ side @-@ side comparison , but how a white sign is dealt with . during the meeting , this option must be disabled . in the default setting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are indicated , but they will be treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
intensive after even smaller sub@@ ways . the option is activated in the default . it is effective with complicated and large files but slowly with very large files .
&quot; in Automati@@ cally @-@ Next@@ mode determines this setting , as long as the result of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ sol@@ ves all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . ( default is manual choice . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the automatic selection of files in numbers or comments if the options numbers ign@@ ore or ign@@ ant C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapters to sc@@ anning folders and exec@@ uting a compilation . look for details under documentation for directory and assem@@ bling .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached . if already such a back@@ drop file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exists , this no further backup will be deleted . &quot;
fits the language of the user interface . the change of this option does not cover the current program . you have to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and re@@ boot the change in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set out globally using the control center . )
the following enco@@ ders can be adjusted for each entry . if you are activated this option for all entries the upper setting is used .
&quot; about the sel@@ ections for the co@@ ding will appear a short notice , what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects , as special characters are treated and interpreted as the co@@ ding for each file is used individually , can even be mer@@ ged with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify here which code should be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code can only work with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of issu@@ ing operations . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress Her@@ vor@@ es of changes in white characters in the text or transi@@ tions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options numbers ign@@ ore or ign@@ ant C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available , if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files are shown . however , B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal nor a second over@@ saf@@ er column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available place on the screen rather for long rows . let you simply use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the equ@@ ation window next to each other or another . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and decide to exec@@ ute files . current file will be combined with the assem@@ bling menu , even if you use only two files . a simple click will start to start the mer@@ ge again , then the name of the most recently used compensation . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which can handle your own preferences . you can use this feature or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred to this external command ( see above ) , the output of the command will be used only at the same time . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your own preferences . each entry does must have a related output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought of it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , it will need an external program , and most users do not want to program itself . the good news is however completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing power for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ velop@@ ing : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some keywords automatically generated by the text files : sed \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may perhaps begin to understand it and maybe like these regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing warran@@ t for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equal suitable &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 4567@@ 89 - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ E@@ ach characters between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a match , and every match is replaced by nothing so qu@@ asi . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several options at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the needs of each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e &apos;@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ l &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ l &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ l &apos; s are required at per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the afor@@ emen@@ tioned &apos; \ \ &apos; . sample :
the data after normal pre@@ processor are ret@@ ained for the display and the inter@@ locking . the further operations are changing only the data which the Z@@ eil@@ ing @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the cell processor looks the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor command are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences or destroy it in the worst cases important data . &quot;
often you need to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ si@@ v and together .
... makes for each object a proposal for meeting you ; you can adapt the suggestion before the start !
... can result sim@@ ulate and displays the sim@@ ulated modifications to do without they really perform .
... introduces selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ ative and mer@@ ging of single files very similar . you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folder will be mer@@ ged , then folders is used as a base . if no target folder was used , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start the mer@@ ging . to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the recording of the folder you will be informed about the current progress . if you break the sc@@ anning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when the sc@@ anning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a window window with the results on the left side ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually shown together . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and you can use all sub@@ directories using all the folder or valves . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file , the file will be started and it appears as a compar@@ ing ster . &quot;
the icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Detail@@ ed window of the selected object . in such a case the assem@@ bling action will not be chosen automatically . if the co@@ ding will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again . &quot;
&quot; as in the above picture is to be seen in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered to be identical if you are identical to the content . then also folders are the same color . in folders is the age essential for its color .
&quot; the idea for this colour scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf @-@ guard , which is only green , then yellow will be and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradi@@ ct@@ ory fil@@ es . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging can not be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. when A folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradi@@ ct@@ ory fil@@ es . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging can not be started . &quot;
the mode to synchroni@@ ze is active if only two folders and no exp@@ lic@@ ate target folder and if the option directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : together and save the result in both folders and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible fil@@ ename for the output ( B ; directly after the co@@ ding copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folder will be mer@@ ged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ge ( un@@ sure ) , then investig@@ ates &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and sugge@@ sts the newer file to copy , then the date is identical .. soldi@@ er will not be elimin@@ ated , the mer@@ ging of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the mer@@ ging a file after the other . she has been working a file after the other . she was successful if the mer@@ ging was successfully completed , and corresponding to other messages if something unknown , you should make a last review and check if the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; when in the case dialog displays full analysis of full analysis , K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 further columns display . these contain the number un@@ resolved conflicts , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only display if three files are compared or together . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either match the straight entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assem@@ ble actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the assem@@ bling . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then is used in the three @-@ folder compil@@ ing mode C as the target , when the two @-@ folder mer@@ ger will be elected as a destination and be used at synchron@@ ise A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination please check if all entries can be displayed in the target structure , even in the folder structure could be displayed , also check these options to avoid un@@ loved sur@@ prises . &quot;
to install all entries : select directories / continue in directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contradi@@ ct@@ ory file types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , sim@@ ulate and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
select if you just want to see what would happen to be done without the really changes made . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then takes certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( mer@@ ge a single file ) then will open a combination window ( note the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not yet stored , a corresponding dialog box . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error occurs , a message and detailed status of information . at the end of the list you will continue to be able to choose the cause of the problem , or you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other way before you proceed with the co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually assembled , mer@@ kt &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entry ( in the current session ) and leads them to later together again . even if you change the mer@@ ging action , this entry will again be mer@@ ged . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are shown in the Elem@@ ent@@ ary . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element@@ ary tree ; it can be displayed more than a pattern . valid credit card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element@@ ary tree ; it can be displayed more than a pattern . valid credit card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems you have a encryp@@ tion score . in other fil@@ es@@ . this option makes you decide whether these files will be displayed in the element@@ ary tree or not . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
&quot; at links to files : if the option is swit@@ ched , symbo@@ lic link@@ ages compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; at links to folder : if the option is swit@@ ched , the links like normal folders are treated and re@@ cur@@ sive disorder . a link to a folder of a link to yourself has result@@ ed on a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower when it is applied to files which does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder of a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the change date and the file size test . please use a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is off default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential to the change date . there is no real comparison instead of . the files will be considered as equal , when cop@@ ying the change date . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; activated the synchroni@@ zation mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was selected . in this mode , the results will be identical . also the results of the mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of the mer@@ ging the copy of the newer file as action proposed . ( this is considered un@@ sure that the other file has not been altered . you should consider this option in any case . ) This option is swit@@ ched in any case . ) This option is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version will be named and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exist , so this without further backup will be deleted . this option is push@@ ed into the default file . this option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder of single files remains visible ; you can turn the window files with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window windows in the window menu and switch the switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file just by double @-@ clicking on . however , there is a single file to run directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be done , and the file will not run once again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; this status , however , if you want to read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparent using K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folder to opening up on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ ressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folder . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively un@@ und@@ one . or .. contain . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special signs must be mas@@ ked mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of con@@ stra@@ ints : &quot;
or it can not be dis@@ closed if a link indicates a file or folder . then a file will be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to process justi@@ fication or change date . therefore , soft the auth@@ orization , or the changing date from the original . ( note that the option trusted the size . ) ( This is only available with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the major purpose of the main purpose is currently being the differences in K@@ De@@ velop . K@@ De@@ velop initially always start the built @-@ in differences @-@ vie@@ wers . to start K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3@@ Part show out of the context menu . &quot;
normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete entry @-@ file . if there is however a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then it takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or you can select on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since the creation of the patch file .
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part run , it only supports the compar@@ ative of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the assem@@ bling or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ di@@ ff and K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 2 ( now heater ) are already . also the name K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 is already stated that it can lead the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff @-@ tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot to have learned into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or to go through him .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources comp@@ ile and the configure script probably not the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default , you can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more detailed information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will appear to each other . if similar lines appear to each other because this is co@@ inci@@ dence but this is called the case . &quot;
the editor is responsible for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict by clicking on the sources and select the button . this important information is being saved as a text file and it &apos;s too much effort to det@@ ach extra a private file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used to another editor .
after remo@@ ving text is suddenly lt ; No src lin@@ s ; published and the text does not be delete . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to the high@@ lighted of differences . even more Her@@ vor@@ es would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug@@ gs came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir is installed in the folder in your system in the K@@ DE . if you are un@@ safe , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ con@@ f and autom@@ ake , you should have any problems in comp@@ ile . should nevertheless problems occur , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing lists . &quot;
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or change ) copies the selected text . inser@@ ting the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position and replaced the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences show : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you have to add changes to these options the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; there will be only entries shown , the differences point out that the identical files will not be copied in the target folder . if the target folder will not be copied in the target folder . ( the behaviour will probably be changed after a later program ) . ) This option is de@@ activated in a later program . ) This option is de@@ activated in the default . ) &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines made out of the respective window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they are already available on the button on the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . Under@@ standing in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual workshops . it is quite handy to change the ongoing programs on the working areas , to end their size , to end or move it . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual workshops , as well as those in the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and other . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has been published , nor the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and completion . the commands can be effective : &quot;
maxim@@ ize the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when a application was cli@@ cked .
send the application to select virtual desktop . only appears when a application was cli@@ cked .
&quot; this point is marked , the window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be post@@ pon@@ ed with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , you will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual workshops are shown . &quot;
&quot; cru@@ ise this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas , it is displayed together with name , the names of folders are disp@@ at@@ ched , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the ongoing programs will appear as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work areas are shown to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program was selected . simply displays simple rect@@ angle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager to be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster appear , like from P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ ed ; wa@@ ver@@ ly shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a wa@@ ited and sen@@ tically set in a sens@@ ed series , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that he can display in size , the windows as ic@@ ons or with their content can be displayed and move . furthermore , he runs out the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent sample set up ... lets the dialogue settings appear .
currently this still cannot be changed in dialogue settings . you can do this but manually do :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c using any text editor like e.g. &amp; k@@ edit ; or VI@@ . if you have not login as user root or log in to your system administrator . in this file you must register the keys of window@@ s@@ Mode and add this one value . possible values are :
&quot; since &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is needed , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screensaver . you can see with &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen , so as you would like to read a mag@@ ni@@ fying for the small printed or the exact spect@@ acle of a photo . this application is intended for various users : this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new functions . it is optimized for use on powerful computers . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; km@@ ag ; start a window like above . the main window of the screen is shown . in the below , this window will be shown as a larger window .. the picture that is shown in the larger window , is an enlarged section of the screen and is described as a selection window . &quot;
in the default setting increased &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter like a mov@@ able mag@@ ni@@ fier . alternatively you can hide a selected screen area in enlarge the screen mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter ( choice ) on the left screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
&quot; do you want to avoid the mouse po@@ inter in the enlarged window , choose the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; km@@ ag ; currently not be able to recognize the form of mouse po@@ inter . this is always the default K@@ DE ; -@@ Maus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in enlarge and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the content of the enlarge and move it with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally hit the &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the optional window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . take note that the upper left corner of the sel@@ ects can be fixed and just move the lower right corner .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; has a lot of functions . you can copy the bigger picture directly to the printer , paste into a file to add to the clip@@ board ( to add later to other applications ) , the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . the st@@ opping of updating causes the needed CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode an extension window displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; uses automatically your included short@@ cut to save files , open a new window , dru@@ s , new@@ sletters ( with the button again load again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and sh@@ red@@ ders &amp; etc . &quot;
km@@ ag is also known as a km@@ ag@@ ni@@ fier ; is a screen sav@@ er . you can use a mag@@ ni@@ fier ; this application is using a mag@@ ni@@ fier to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people use : from research classi@@ cs or artists up to the web @-@ designer or se@@ ven@@ ors .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ag ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ag ) .
&amp; km@@ ag@@ ni@@ fier ; was developed by O@@ la@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ sf@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ stress @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse po@@ inter a while on the same place is res@@ in . it is thought to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syn@@ drome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ radi@@ ate syn@@ drome ) and which each mouse @-@ click pain was prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse po@@ inter alia a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who believe in the Rep@@ eti@@ tive stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) . besides , it can em@@ ulate the target with the mouse . this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , who is created when clicking the mouse and helps to explo@@ it so many people , the computer without pain , you should look at pain that using your computer you should look at pain , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to get it once again : even if &amp; km@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ ains helps , who is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that can be caused by means of the mouse to be us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic tools : the result can be used for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; super@@ vised your mouse mov@@ able and guides a mouse click when you break the movement short .
&quot; is the intelligent moving activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it has left mouse button . move the mouse button is waiting to exec@@ ute the mouse button . in this way you can exec@@ ute a little exercise , but you get rid of them quickly . &quot;
this bo@@ ating time has to hide according to the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; is Intel@@ lig@@ ently shift shi@@ fted , the la@@ the shi@@ fted time ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here is the time set to get the mouse button , before it is waiting to get the mouse button , if it happens not any evidence because of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click away by mouse shi@@ fting , followed by a break and back , followed by a break . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ us@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears , you can short@@ cut &amp; K@@ DE ; to short@@ cut the response time . open the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buff@@ er that you put on a lower value to short@@ cut the answer times . &quot;
&quot; this option is marked , &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool is launched . this feature is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at GNO@@ ME or other shut@@ ters , please refer to the respective documentation to rate , to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all the settings back to the values which were adjusted when opening the dialogue . have you already push@@ ed the button , the settings will be applied to the stand after the last Dr@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; first use with preferences . especially the smart shift should be swit@@ ched first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the hearing click , it is necessary necessary to reduce the reply times by &amp; K@@ DE ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the Click on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not cause any link , does not cause any link to those places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse are printed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the tri@@ ck is clean , but also the roles that come with the mouse @-@ ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to figure out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . it should be clear , if you view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball away , you have to see the roles . these are in the sides of the hole , into which the ball was inser@@ ted . the Dre@@ ck and the tast@@ ings you can easily re@@ play with a flat blade or the fing@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system was started the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just use a shi@@ fting organ@@ ically , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , this surgery is no longer able by the s@@ ake of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can exec@@ ute yourself a mouse click . this is due to the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; res@@ et and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text tries to run &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; further cli@@ cks to run and sets the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to place it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of working space if you want to give up a keyboard short@@ cut . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cli@@ cks are non @-@ viol@@ ent reactions . safe zones for the mouse cli@@ cks are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bar and menus and the title of windows .
&quot; I try to work with the smart shift , but I made it not so that text . &quot;
the intelligent shift is a advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs his time to copy it to copy and add to any other action in the clip@@ board . but there will probably be some problems . here are some advice on this :
use the intelligent moving not only if you just begin using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : exec@@ ute a mouse button down while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and there again the mouse button .
&quot; use the hearing mouse click . this becomes each time , if &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button express@@ es a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the smart for@@ eh@@ ling also without the hearing mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; you have to be installed , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Wind@@ ow are installed . this should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the read@@ able mouse cli@@ cks is only available when the system features a sound card and speaker and this is accurate .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; rein@@ forced the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter , in short res@@ in . this program has been developed for people who are suffering at R@@ SI syn@@ drome and to those the actu@@ ation of the mouth @-@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ou@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as there is a certain time waiting for that a target process starts , before the mouse button will be left . in this way the mouse can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is a program , which can be able to speak their computers for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; allows a total user to speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk , which should be addressed again . &quot;
on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes screens ) enter the command line that will be used later for the language edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the registration catalogue .
on the second side you select the standard text box . from the tex@@ pass@@ ag@@ greg@@ ations you can often use the text pass@@ ages without them to use them . the tex@@ pass@@ ages can naturally be edited .
on the third page ( right screens ) determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . &amp; km@@ outh . reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally you can only recorded the voc@@ abul@@ ary with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary . additionally you can only be recorded correctly in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ stroke of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; correct , you can enter in the input field the pro@@ positions that you want to listen . every single sentence will be attached to the delay . you can choose from these pro@@ positions that should be addressed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ entry settings km@@ outh , set up ... open the imagination dialog by &amp; km@@ outh . this dialog contains two cartridges cards , language edition and settings , the page of Wor@@ ter@@ ing , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card @-@ card language , you give the command to the call of language generator . in the selection field under the input field , you specify the tim@@ efr@@ ont , with the text to the language generator will be dis@@ closed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two types , the text continue to pass the text , if the text is to be forwar@@ ded to the language generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the app@@ artment is not selected , the text is shared as parameter . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the language edition of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples to be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; to use as a language service as a language service , &amp; km@@ outh is to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page is currently being updated . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
with the first sel@@ ective action in the selection of a text message you determine which action is trig@@ ger@@ ed by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text@@ book in the menu text@@ book or is trig@@ ger@@ ed in the box for tex@@ tual books .
&quot; with the selection of instant you will speak the chosen text message directly , and additionally inser@@ ted in the distribution memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text was first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of closing the machining centre for text@@ book , you can specify whether the text@@ book is automatically saved on closing the machining system automatically . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ words , the book will be saved . if you select changes will not be stored , the text@@ book is not saved , will be stored &amp; km@@ outh . ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page of Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; km@@ outh , a sel@@ ection@@ field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can select the currently used dic@@ tion@@ aries to the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons right on the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add them to a file . below the list you can edit the names and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; choose this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh , read the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words will simply be determined by selecting the insur@@ rection . additionally , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can mer@@ ge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; as@@ ks which words are mer@@ ged , and how they should be weight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh &apos;s words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of tex@@ pass@@ ag@@ greg@@ ations is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the tex@@ ture is represented as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can change the text@@ book or associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can change only its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text pass@@ ages or books add or selected text pass@@ ages , and books you can either delete the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via an un@@ folded menu . &quot;
the order of tex@@ pass@@ ag@@ greg@@ ations or text pass@@ ages can be made by hand using the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the chosen text is cut and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is located in the sub@@ field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the pro@@ gression . &quot;
&quot; this menu item is displayed , a shi@@ fts @-@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands can be displayed directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the narro@@ wing left side and hand , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; is this menu item , is a narrow spir@@ its in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; km@@ outh , if not termin@@ ated , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu @-@ entry is indicated , a shi@@ fts @-@ box for tex@@ tual information is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar window directly under the work@@ pieces left side by mouse click on the narrow left side and hand can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably you have given the command for the language edition is not correct or not completely inser@@ ted . open settings km@@ outh . open settings , open the page General settings and enter the command for the language edition on the card @-@ card language .

for the third example the option has to be swit@@ ched as default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei um , therefore you need an additional program to set the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA is installed in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax are will@@ ingly search@@ ed to the last sign of the text , so that a common sign must be specified . the full command is therefore consum@@ ing as in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option will send data as default .
&quot; the language edition of D@@ ress@@ mon by &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ more language service , which is available in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language edition . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of language is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service as a language service . &quot;
&quot; to use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the installation dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh . needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is a application with the people who can not speak , text by calcul@@ ator can be saved , the user can always be returned to the users again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no language syn@@ thesi@@ zer includes . on the machine a voice @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer must be installed .

&quot; filter for drawing @-@ up packaging offer a good opportunity to correct or incorrect news ; it is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the news , the mail sends , and furthermore the expression / local / In@@ box because of this in most cases can be accepted as provided . Read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
&quot; in filtration , text is edited to replace it to the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pr@@ ono@@ un@@ ced words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to handle certain def@@ ects of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ read all other orders , and maint@@ ains this orders . if the output of the screen is read and will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the output of warning .
&quot; News have the nearest priority . a message sub@@ stitut@@ ed normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example for an application that can be used . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a Web site can welcome you , who is just sitting room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ notifications are also news . Read more . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text applications . every order , you come from the card card orders , is a text message . K@@ Say@@ it is an example for a applications that have been used for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in waiting for qu@@ eu@@ e , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application has been sent out the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such pre@@ reads , this issue is lift@@ ed and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and tex@@ tures , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter@@ ing the text and specify it on the next filters . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filter are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
cartoon replace parts of a text by other text . the available parts can be delivered either as words or as a regular expression . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is used with pre@@ defined character of chat ( as : - ) by text or for the implementation of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format into another format ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker devices , you can refer to a speaker on the contents of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can leave text by K@@ DE @-@ News about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied to a language edition , if the filter is not applicable , he gives the text unchanged to the next filters . &quot;
&quot; if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ notifications will be edited on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is edited through all activated filters , which are arranged on the page below . the processing through the filter is carried out in the list from top to below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . is a filter does not termin@@ ated , it is not activated and is not used . filter the series will be set up from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter cover and there will be shown below the following entries .
&quot; for setting up time frame filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison list . these pattern can be found in the text , then the text is elimin@@ ated against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
enter your filter a name a name . this name you can choose arbit@@ r@@ ary number you must only differ from the names of the other filters .
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expression . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string chains , and re@@ places him in accordance with the string chain from the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the mark@@ er word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , the current list store or delete a list from a file , the entries can be downloaded from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; is here a language registered , the filter is only applied if the spok@@ es@@ person speaks for the text message here . click the button to display a list of languages , if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value included , the filter is only applied if the text of one of the given applications comes . you can enter multiple programs separately by com@@ mat@@ a . example : Con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID can get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be taken away . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy . &quot;
&quot; the drawing filter filters will only apply to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box dial filters , if all the inputs are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words used the time @-@ type of regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ n . words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; the editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expression can be found in the package k@@ big@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is an W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ formed XML . it can be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker hoses you can send texts to a certain speaker which is set on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can read for example , that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before there is a text to the filter , there is a spok@@ es@@ person for the text . the speaker will be selected based on the speaker , which selected the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program can be selected by the speaker cable , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; is here a value included , the filter is used if the text is used in the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; the editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expression , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with entering the button . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anch@@ ored the regular expression at the beginning of the string chain , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; place the properties of the desired speaker . if the text met the above specified filter conditions , the speaker is selected that corresponds to the desired requirements at the bottom line . click on the button to view the dialog box . &quot;
use this buttons to save your speaker or delete or delete all settings .
&quot; the spok@@ es@@ person filter is used only then to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box tiles . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the language edition , of &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer can give their applications TTS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API with the language syn@@ thesi@@ zer to K@@ TT@@ SD added so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesi@@ zer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility Website ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications &amp; Ds call on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object of K@@ speech .
&quot; here , text of the text to address and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are still more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start first in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesi@@ zer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesi@@ zer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ duc@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 , you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ B@@ LE worked at all . you will also do so if you do not use the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and how the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H can be found . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or p@@ unc@@ ement seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesi@@ zer , so that all pro@@ positions will be printed or just gu@@ ardi@@ g . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option will be adjusted to the correct value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain signs or words , this may be correct@@ ed by a sign @-@ stream filter . see . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above mentioned languages can be in@@ complete or be out@@ dated , therefore , draw the description of the syn@@ thesi@@ zer to use the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; use a custom@@ iz@@ able module @-@ architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer . if you want to expand it ; for using another syn@@ thesi@@ zers please contact the developers .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter is not imper@@ ative . Deb@@ ian users can x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source of texts for k@@ de@@ pot or have downloaded the tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; use ; use first , check whether Speech disp@@ at@@ cher will be properly working with your voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer . this enables you to use the Sh@@ ell@@ yd@@ pt sp@@ d @-@ con@@ f . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ DE ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher is intended to be developed so , that the establishment of Speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ con@@ f is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled in individual pro@@ positions . the user can work or drop down , repeat the issue or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application works on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sur@@ rounds the properties of the prefer@@ ed speaker for the output . thus , it can be selected for example a femin@@ ine English speaker . if you want to find a spok@@ es@@ person , it will automatically choose the best suited speaker . if you choose more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker will be chosen , take a look at . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map card speaker on Ad@@ ding , and therefore select a speaker into the list or click to Edit the card set up . as an example will be shown in the following the establishment of the module Interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to exec@@ utable F@@ estival@@ program . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is required to enter only festival .
&quot; select the string enco@@ ding for text , who are handed over at the festival . in general , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages as is ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ding lifts , you put a volume , microphone speed and pitch of syn@@ thetic language . if you can not select some controller and do not display this gray , makes the voice you choose to do these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with more memory @-@ consumption ) the first sentence has been syn@@ thetic syn@@ thetic . &quot;
&quot; if this app@@ artment cannot be selected , you have not yet established a spok@@ es@@ person ( or forget to apply ) . see . &quot;
&quot; this point is marked , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ ell still does not run , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD have read a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop or control it or otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in qu@@ eu@@ e , along with the application that the order has set out the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can work on the order , which is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sent@@ ences ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other cartridges cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be push@@ ed to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;

&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audi@@ os should be used , select here the audio @-@ output . if no output module can be displayed in the list , you need to install AL@@ SA here . see also the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; Set the right @-@ speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ 1 % approximately the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
on this card card you can set special actions that will always be executed if the tex@@ ture is under@@ going from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ern has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ read all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen @-@ reader has been read , the associated orders will be returned . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . this orders will continue to be continued after the warning of the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message sub@@ ordin@@ ate normal text . &amp; km@@ outh , is an example for an application to leave the news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a Web site can welcome you with &amp; km@@ outh . nevertheless someone welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; will be a text message by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio edition in the qu@@ eu@@ e . &quot;
this audio file will always be canc@@ eled when a normal tex@@ ture is inter@@ rupted . if both lon@@ ely sound is active and intro@@ duct@@ ory message will be played before the intro@@ duct@@ ory message .
&quot; the settings on this map card apply only for normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen Re@@ ad@@ ors , there is no special promotions if this through a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to leave with &amp; kt@@ ts ; KN@@ oti@@ fy messages to leave , launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click notifications . the card card will appear . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language edition , the volume , the volume of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tically male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog will not be adjusted to 100@@ 01 % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mo@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ det@@ ect filters ( SD@@ B @-@ filter ) . SB@@ Ds under@@ share text in individual pro@@ positions . this can also be the first set of syn@@ the@@ tization as only the first set of syn@@ thetic orders . thus , you can also stop or break down or break down , even if the language syn@@ thesi@@ zer this is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the show @-@ bound@@ aries filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is automatically furnished as a pre @-@ bound@@ ary det@@ ect filter automatically . you can change its settings or add further read@@ iness filters , but will be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; at the easi@@ est way to study the establishment of the Spre@@ ader panel , and enter text for illness . check out some properties and check out how to choose the selection of speakers . this must of course be installed more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with entry can begin , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold text files on the card @-@ card orders or break down , even if the language syn@@ thesi@@ zer this function is not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal conflict file is automatically set up , if you start t@@ sm@@ ell to the first time . it cannot be removed only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
setting filters compare text with a regular expression for S@@ atz@@ ing and add a tab@@ ul@@ atory ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) on the sentence ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) in front of the text ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) are automatically ret@@ ained out of the text file .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ k ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from reconc@@ iled the normal sel@@ ectivity filter , you can insert this again by clicking the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the card @-@ card speaker you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if

&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play any role , do not give anything . &quot;
select this article when the property should have priority before other attri@@ butes . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in the wher@@ e@@ for@@ es of the issue , this property is rarely used , if you might want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you need to know that a certain application text in another language is sent to the working environment . &quot;

on the card card audio there is a setting speed . this works you need to be so@@ x installed and using the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer modules like Festival Interactive offer even on the card card for speaker . depending on the selected voice is this active or in@@ active .
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored when &amp; HTML ; ( see , that the HTML in SS@@ ML is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML file . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer , whose source code is evident . the quality of the voices is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ; set up . &quot;
&quot; you need to install a language at least one language . help to edit them in the instructions , which will be supplied with the festival , you need to install web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compil@@ ing an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to con@@ stra@@ ints during the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice uses the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early stage , you need to enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the Russian voices _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ r@@ ill@@ ische ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) co@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; that allows the management of the network interface , the rout@@ ing and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user management of a number of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting the K Menu k@@ control@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; create the ranges of &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the module networking settings ; Internet &amp; Network networking settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; are started .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to be installed and configured to the device at all , and the adjustment of the network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices simultaneously added at the Inst@@ all of &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed networks later , the drivers must be downloaded according to the adaptation of the files , according to the core version . &quot;
the module networking is loaded when the option network settings is selected at the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; index is selected . when the types of module networking is trying to det@@ ect this that the platform used in the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the brass selection offered is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and rel@@ eas@@ ed best matches . thanks to mark the setting non @-@ again , the definition can be made permanent . at the next start of the network settings it will automatically be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . before , all options are shown grey , what means that the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration system , by clicking the button . it is the entry of the password required . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration system , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three rider : &quot;
the tab network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the tab network interface can be performed by the following tasks :
the configur@@ able network interface can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button @-@ up interface to set up into the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button of the button of enlargement and shows dialogue with further options . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server , or BO@@ O@@ TP server for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server , therefore , no further setting is required . in the selection list may either be selected as DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
with the selection Manu@@ ally can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network . in the input field networks is to set the sub@@ str@@ ass .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alized the system the network interface in the board . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values specified in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the unit .
it should be ensured that IP address in the network would not already be used for an existing IP address . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network should be asked .
&quot; networking equipment can be activated or swit@@ ched on , depending on the required network , it is performed by selecting from the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; networking equipment can be activated or swit@@ ched on , depending on your needs . switching a activ@@ ator network is carried out by selecting from the list and click on interface .... &quot;
places the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ network that convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with b@@ ills in other sub@@ systems .
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface to the net is to be selected in which the gat@@ eway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support re@@ places a complete domain address by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only can understand IP addresses . if the machine is required : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the machine is required to address this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.90 .
&quot; the machine to the nam@@ ing part of the gradu@@ ation item enables easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed wer@@ .@@ DNS @-@ entries can be ordered by selecting a single tr@@ ages and hin@@ ders in the list with the buttons , or her@@ under in the top priority . &quot;
by clicking the button add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing solution can be added a DNS server . it will display the dialog Neue Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then enter the button . the entry is then inser@@ ted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the button . it will display the dialog box . &quot;
the list of well known calcul@@ ators describes invo@@ icing description for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats . in small , enclos@@ ed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of well known calcul@@ ator contains some entries who support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still being replaced in the test version of IP to version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialog Neue Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; the name of the well @-@ known machines enter and enter the Add button . if the well known calcul@@ ator has multiple ali@@ as names , de kno@@ b add several times and enter the further Ali@@ as names . &quot;
select an entry from the list and select Edit computers from the list and select Edit ... The dialog box is shown .
&quot; it may be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK , the list of the static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module is effective immediately in the system . to activate changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; is http : / / c@@ driver@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net that can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of bin@@ ary distribu@@ tions ( usually rpm packages ) ranges it if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed .
installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package to download and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with a graphic user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; not , but additionally the development of the development is needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this will only be recommended by experienced users . it is not difficult , &amp; c@@ s@@ con@@ f ; to comp@@ ile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first paragraph of this chapter , important information on fundamental network systems are given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this Annex only basic information on the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
&quot; currently IP networks with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) has never found large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected , that in the near future , this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware that IP address is available to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to be used or if available , DH@@ CP can be easily chosen as desired ! &quot;
&quot; while placing an own little ( home ) network should be chosen the IP address from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address network with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below will not be forwar@@ ded , therefore their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting an type of type . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is for networks up to 250 calcul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the mains mas@@ ke is mostly on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machine participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the two @-@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) is required for IP forwar@@ ding . &quot;
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part you are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ network@@ con@@ f ; and where they are stored in the various distribu@@ tions .
&quot; sometimes this file is dynam@@ ically changed at D@@ SL connections , so that it is then not surprised if in case of active D@@ SL connections will be found to another content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is falling out by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; when the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list previously released tasks and related environmental variable . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system as well as system@@ internal tasks . each folder can be up and folded . &quot;
&quot; in case of de@@ activated task , the program and parameters are not shown and below description appears de@@ activated . &quot;
the variable variable variable @-@ variable use the otherwise existing environments for all listed tasks except power . when de@@ activ@@ ating variable variable appears as description de@@ activated .
&quot; to create a new task , select first to Edit the tasks . go then in the menu Add new .... alternatively , you can also select either with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and click the context menu new ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the program &apos;s start@@ up program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute s@@ name . if you want to search the program first . click here
choose the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can indicate the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you specify both monthly @-@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be carried out both at the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the elected months independently of the week@@ day , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as in the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active if the cr@@ ont@@ ab was stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , they first select the too remote task . go then to machining . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select the button , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , they first select the crossover task . go then to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select cop@@ ying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
to insert a task first or have to be copied or copied first in the clip@@ board . only then inser@@ ted inser@@ tion at all . select the tasks of the folder . go then to Edit In@@ ser@@ ting .
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and select inser@@ tion , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
to make changes to a task , select first one . go to the menu item Be@@ work Chang@@ ing .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then appear the dialog task , in which you , as described above , the selected task can be edit . &quot;
to delete a task and select the task of delet@@ ing task . go then to the menu item Edit Del@@ ete .
&quot; to enable a task or dis@@ able to dis@@ able , select them to and determine the condition with the menu item . in@@ active tasks are featured in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task right click on the task and select activation . make sure you can display your name , parameters and description correctly . &quot;
&quot; to exec@@ ute a task immediately , select them and then proceed to work . &quot;
to create a new ambi@@ ent variable , select first the variable folder . go to the menu item Edit New .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select New ... button or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select a list of the most frequently used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable name . this are :
send e @-@ mails from the current program to send another than the normal address
&quot; as when creating new variables , changes will only be made when the cr@@ ont@@ ab was stored . &quot;
to cut an variable that they first select the removal vari@@ able . go then to machining .
to copy an ambi@@ ent variable , choose the first variable variable . go then to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select cop@@ ying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add an ambi@@ ent variable , first one has to be cut or copied to the clip@@ board . only then the option In@@ ser@@ ted at all . select the variable folder . then proceed to Edit In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable you can first change the variable variations . go then to Edit variations .... alternatively , you can edit using the right mouse button on the variable , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then load the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable . &quot;
to delete a ambi@@ ent variable , select first the variable . go then to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to activate a ambi@@ ent variable or dis@@ able , select them , and place the condition with the menu item Edi@@ tion@@ fest . in case of de@@ activated variable appears under description de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also select using the right mouse button on the variable and select activation . make sure that name and value of the variables is correct . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been made or modified , you still need to save the cr@@ ont@@ ab file . select the menu item file . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are only active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ printer dialog . if you select check out , see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ ont@@ from all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own extended auth@@ orization .
cr@@ on for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the sch@@ ed@@ ules of users .
a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UN@@ IX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UN@@ IX ; to experience time and date .
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create several archives on a tape . the second goal was the reply of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for fast , sel@@ ective out@@ pack@@ ers offered . the second goal was to answer my wife : how much longer takes it , if you in@@ sured ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the fore@@ vers@@ er on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ acher , search@@ es for the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything is smooth , changing the symbol for the band@@ age , in order to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , the contents of the tape can now be search@@ ed through out the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before the throw of the tape , first should be trig@@ ger@@ ed the involvement . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; gives by a change of symbols for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message . the band can now be thro@@ wn out at no risk . &quot;
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; used to be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; a strip @-@ cards must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use the form of data . this process does not have to be form@@ att@@ ed to the formation , it must be form@@ att@@ ed before the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed it can usually be form@@ att@@ ed by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed it can usually do a form@@ atting of the tape ahead , D@@ AT @-@ drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape , and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form , the band will be automatically integrated and is ready for . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup of the backup , you must select the files to saf@@ er files . this can happen in three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . it is only the file specified in the profile specified .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select Options ...
&quot; once the backup was initi@@ ated , opens the dialogue settings to secure . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be back . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will be tested only the selected file or folder .
select files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item ....
&quot; once the test has been started , the dialog settings for check . in this dialog you can even check your choice and change the work place for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue will be review . this dialog displays the progress of the testing process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can connect the re@@ produce , the files , which are to be restored , this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band@@ age . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives using a tick . it will only be restored the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Edit ...
&quot; once the re @-@ start process was started , the dialogue settings for recovery . in this dialog you can even check your choice and change the work place for the restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog displays the progress of the process process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it pro@@ ves to be necessary to create the strip @-@ file based on the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing Index@@ files for this volume . you can create the index in two types of tape :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile will be created with the straight files and the default settings . you can make the following settings : &quot;
&quot; the current working sub@@ folder , in which the backup is to be done . the list of the saf@@ er files will be automatically updated according to the selected working device . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under secur@@ ities files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , you can find on other file systems , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by t@@ ar independently of the others . &quot;
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the final incre@@ mental backup will only be used for the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used for fixing the changes since the final incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file from the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of making this documentation yet .
the settings allows you to set up via the menu item KD@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be made :
the full path to the device for the band@@ age ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ ath variant of the tape .
&quot; is this attitude active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is involved the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary to be performed before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option swit@@ ched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the outlet in the band@@ age work . maybe this attitude does not work with all the band@@ age . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , the holes of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is thro@@ wn out . use this option not at flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option swit@@ ched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ous block size for the tape . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you must notify you &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block@@ age for your band@@ age . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , writes it a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only be a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is invo@@ icing : seconds , with invo@@ icing of the complete name of the system , on which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds since the ep@@ och has passed since the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives that should be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar should manage themselves . even other t@@ ar versions should not work as long as it is not to be ink@@ able security .
test the contents of a backup of a backup . this symbol is only active if a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ vie@@ wers can not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system allows you to get information about your system , or where the system will perform the different protocol . it allows for quick access to information about problems , which appear on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background makes the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited the different protocol .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access the fast access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tried to provide some advanced features , with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be filter@@ ed and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has been &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , among other things include : &quot;
support for many different types of proto@@ col@@ s files for the format of the sys@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screenshot , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with their help the individual protocol lines easily filter@@ ing and filter@@ ed . the individual ways to sorting and filter@@ ing will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol . will not be displayed , and it opens instead of its a small mess@@ aging window , so you have been working on Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have eligi@@ bility to reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ erion or according to a given time string , the list of proto@@ col@@ li@@ me will be displayed automatically after the selected filter is displayed , if in one of the columns of the filter string is included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry on this page . select the column process , and enter into the filter@@ ing file system protocol on the column process , and carry out the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol @-@ lines come from this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default settings and helps you to identify the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the stage will be shown with a stri@@ king colour as a protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the colored description of protocol can be swit@@ ched .
&quot; do you want to display certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol , or at the cr@@ on @-@ protocol ) , so you can find the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option Z@@ u new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new on the upcoming record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional storage window and you choose a sub@@ window , choose the menu a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort can find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V in@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; . this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program in the buildings of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , efficient and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything else : - ) .
&quot; in@@ it bin@@ ary @-@ file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on system V in@@ it , without a new installation and re @-@ dating file . therefore , you need to be found that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one there . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it is also different from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are held directly in / etc . this folder called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . generally you need a script for each system service you want to start using the system or change to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as set@@ ser@@ ial , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should go to your turn on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if there is actually a r@@ c.@@ ser@@ ial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something with the ser@@ ial connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can throw a look at the second column and probably determine that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it / etc / in@@ itt@@ ings from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you can fix the system re@@ boot the system and exec@@ ute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder will not be correct files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; as starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written , that there is an argument as start and stop . you can start this scripts actually by hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the http@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes , the script will be called with the argument . if he called a S , the script will be called with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way , machines for many purpose . I could have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level can have , network &amp; etc ; run it also could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc . start . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another sign is simple to not say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply drag an entry from the field of Available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop . ) .
&quot; you can also post@@ pon@@ ed between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within an levels by changing it from the original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will be done only if they move an entry from the field of availability services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed , if you want to copy this into a new area . to select them explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu or even then when the same entry has already exist in the field of action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting Number of an entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such a case you need to edit the variety of entries in which you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; please note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries , which were thro@@ wn in the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work areas ( Available System@@ services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to meet a selection or below the previous ones . &quot;
to move an entry into another Run@@ level to move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
&quot; to change the variety , or change the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by selecting the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to make changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of dat@@ at@@ lu@@ sts require all entries in the menu file a confirmation , before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the default Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now starts the machine @-@ resistant new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in the single @-@ usable mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard runner at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
&quot; the type of how system services are started in this distribution , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the propri@@ etary intro@@ duct@@ ory programmes in this distribution , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or http@@ d ) simply complete without message if its configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level vari@@ es from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after you made changes , you must save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or entry storage in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cartridges cards , user interface , and the user @-@ allergi@@ es . to work , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cartridges cards are shown only if you have enabled devices ( Qu@@ ota ) have created a card card , if you can make individual settings on which you can make individual settings . further card cards appear , if you are installed in pass@@ words or for example , etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ x . &quot;
the card @-@ card Pass@@ word will be released if Shad@@ ow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d how in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ons are installed .
this card card will only appear if for at least a built @-@ in file system space ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here can be modified for each user parameters , whereby the plac@@ ements are available in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be configured individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the field of the field file system .
&quot; card @-@ card groups provides information on group members of the selected users . the standard group , which is one of the users , find in the field primary group . furthermore , users can select the user in other groups by clicking this in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , highlight these users in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select adding the menu user or group or click the appropriate added button of the tool@@ bar . the Edit or delet@@ ing of the selected user or selected group is analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ manager , remove the boot@@ ing device , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , and more . &quot;
