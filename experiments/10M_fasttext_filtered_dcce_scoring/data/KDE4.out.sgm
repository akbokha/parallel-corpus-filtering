<seg id="479">& digitized; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, created but, particularly in dark areas, grab pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unsharp-mask is working on the contrast to let a picture look like it. actually, there is a really good job. you can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is copyright protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocussing is possibly the best of the three, since he really improves the sharp. he is a little more complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this in turn leads to a little blades. this again leads to a little vulnerable. the same phenomenon can be observed if paint points will be printed out of paper. SLR cameras will normally need more bearable sharpening as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images often have been applied to a camera internal sharpation. images in the raw format, it must always be exploited during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can already turn a sharp device during the reader of the picture. if you deactivate this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by using a photo with the sharpening coating process. you can call with the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with caution since the results are not very naturally effective: the sharpening of the edges, but also reinforce the noise. in general it is the need for sharpening an image the tool refocussing. you can reach it more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crack. the solution, the image is a little soft to draw soft and experimenting something with settings. the pre-remuneration on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help edit the picture. the pre-filtering shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the standard values often generate good results, and should first create the effect. if you create the unsharp mask at strong, are robing and the impression of atrocities in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter are affected. high resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore make pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the left one which is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is put.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the tail value is a break from the maximum RGB value and to use differential amount. one can thus be used for a edges of the filter. in this way these areas are taken with a soft change between the tones and therefore the nicity in faces, heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filters. the original image is the (1) and the worked image, (2). blurse maskate was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a tail value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitizing; tool Refocussing refocussed a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used to be protected by copyright shelter filters, algorithm by Ernst Lippe. "</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get a picture of & quot; refocussing quot; this is better approach as just trying the photo to sharp. it is using a technique called FIR Views. refocussing reaches better results than unsharp masking. you can start it out of the menu by using colors refocussing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads far from the original quellpixel, which causes far from the original quamples. the FIR is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular shafts: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most images should result the default value 1 good results. you can get a higher value if your image should be very blur but should then be at home.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help arms. needed correlation can be from 0-1. needed values are 0,5 and the values close to 1; & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the tightening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"Rauschfilter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce arms. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely helpful, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value is still further lubricating."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's Schärfe: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arms. in most cases you should use the correlation to zero, so you might also have correlation to correlation and / orden space filters."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matricity size: this value determines the size of the transformer-atrix. an increase in matricity size can choose good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's Schärfe. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save the save as and loading buttons are exactly used for this purpose. any refocussing parameters which you set will be stored for later and can then be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cuts, colour and intensity reviewing on the picture before you use the module. "</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations make changes not immediately visible, but later they remain unpleasant arrest."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally produces sharp masking produce better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the blur masks, a larger neighborhood used as a sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp, unsharp needs always produce aroma. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the unsharp filter. however, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always just as good as the unsharp mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in dealing with small details."</seg>

<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing effect on alles. p defines the relative smoothing. put this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your picture."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is necessary, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you need a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns to how often the algorithm is going to run. usually dates here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelgradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is also chosen, there should also be small for a long running time. you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable."</seg>

<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favourite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file which can save all necessary conversions for the playing one piece.</seg>

<seg id="1661">"in this section, as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard is shown. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches in the correct order are (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not leave any line for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the tints, which supports the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note using patch 127 (Win one), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI-file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the concept of Drum-patch of the patch is, in which each tone is a different Percussionment (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not that the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (like him have some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to use like tints on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for each channel and each instrument to define multiple keymaps. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to complete tints on the Percussion channel. check out as example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to disconnect some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, you make it simple at CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"in this case the channel is used to use the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap option will naturally be defined in the file name for this channel. if you want to change the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored the patch on this channel. in this case a patch will be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for instance to always use the Permansions patch on the Percussions channel.</seg>

<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM there is a keyboard, that is a keyboard that will be playing with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, but some keyboards get higher to play at an Octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; return."</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a musical piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same banknote in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I cannot do anyone & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocols files for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>

<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, presents & ksystemlog; functions available, with their help the individual protocol lines easily filtering and filtered. the individual ways to sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol. will not be displayed, and it opens instead of its a small messaging window, so you have been working on Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have eligibility to reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or according to a given time string, the list of protocollime will be displayed automatically after the selected filter is displayed, if in one of the columns of the filter string is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry on this page. select the column process, and enter into the filtering file system protocol on the column process, and carry out the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol-lines come from this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default settings and helps you to identify the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of the stage will be shown with a striking colour as a protocol-lines of the level note. the colored description of protocol can be switched.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"do you want to display certain process (e.g. in the system protocol, or at the cron-protocol), so you can find the process identification (PID) in the column process. this may be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the Samba server. in this case you use the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option Zu new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all new on the upcoming record lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional storage window and you choose a subwindow, choose the menu a protocol on display."</seg>

<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V init Editor, more known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv;. this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv. "</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V init develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program in the buildings of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, efficient and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know anything else: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"init binary-file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on system V init, without a new installation and re-dating file. therefore, you need to be found that the old init was removed from there, if there was there one there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init is also different from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are held directly in / etc. this folder called rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. generally you need a script for each system service you want to start using the system or change to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should go to your turn on / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if there is actually a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can throw a look at the second column and probably determine that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it / etc / inittings from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you can fix the system reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l enter in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder will not be correct files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"as starts and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written, that there is an argument as start and stop. you can start this scripts actually by hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes, the script will be called with the argument. if he called a S, the script will be called with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way, machines for many purpose. I could have & eg; a server -Runlevel can have, network & etc; run it also could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc. start."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another sign is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of Available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop.).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also postponed between Runleveln, or change the position within an levels by changing it from the original runlevel (or its position). this will be done only if they move an entry from the field of availability services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed, if you want to copy this into a new area. to select them explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu or even then when the same entry has already exist in the field of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting Number of an entry cannot be calculated sometimes. in such a case you need to edit the variety of entries in which you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"please note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown in the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different work areas (Available Systemservices, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to meet a selection or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel to move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the variety, or change the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by selecting the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to make changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of datatlusts require all entries in the menu file a confirmation, before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the default Runleveln and now starts the machine-resistant new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single-usable mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runner at a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the type of how system services are started in this distribution, simplifies the configuration of the proprietary introductory programmes in this distribution, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply complete without message if its configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
