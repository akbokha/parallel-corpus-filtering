I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , have read American music and operated with his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I became mainly of an American film journ@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fur@@ ious repor@@ ter who were con@@ spir@@ acy of a oil stomach with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who were the top German Court with judgment , who wanted to occup@@ y his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to meth@@ od Man , &quot; me was &apos; s , as if the absolute truth is , ver@@ gis@@ s all others , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation had even more rein@@ forced for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity so welcoming is that you are always the fact that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very anno@@ ying love of his size written .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how he goes with his involvement .
he never keeps his opinion behind the mountain as you are as beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colle@@ ague it express , and explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ us and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have respon@@ ded to his statements and agreed in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices , which he won in the re@@ publi@@ can pre @-@ elections , the highest number that ever achieved by the party of nom@@ inee candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not met Tru@@ mp and his vot@@ ers not with the people who had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alist program@@ ms , people from all over the world will take a deep faithful person , with whom I could have talked about Islam and past . &quot;
&quot; also anim@@ ated Tru@@ m@@ ps World vi@@ vid not with the by Peter B@@ hati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati in@@ quir@@ er &quot; , &quot; over@@ throw . &quot;
B@@ hati@@ a and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game .
&quot; Tru@@ m@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ os@@ ity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , who are fighting for her life long and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits them to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , their wise advice has helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and that through them embo@@ died my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp its way to the nom@@ inee pres@@ idential Presidency , they used to give me a dog and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , the pres@@ idency , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the examination of the idea that people have agreed for Tru@@ mp because they were either part of his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , bro@@ ke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair the Tru@@ mp vot@@ ers as r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; people to enter , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and resp@@ ect@@ ful , and indicates an im@@ ent@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities do not take into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers have agreed upon which most white are agreed for Tru@@ mp because they would like to recover control over a country that she has disappointed ?
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who knows the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( . ) . : as much as &quot; support of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ es &quot; ; voc@@ abul@@ ary of white in exc@@ ess on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate American Ideal - no matter whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a power@@ less idea - what belief or background we always like , America welcomes every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan his story , as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election Donald Tru@@ m@@ ps gives a huge part of the white voice of this promise , and says : to hell , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is on the Ru@@ der they say .
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r K@@ han , the father of a soldiers , who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a lo@@ gi@@ veness for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. K@@ han had a voc@@ al change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , could my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. K@@ han . &quot;
&quot; the quantity answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
would Muslims have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; bre@@ asts the quantity .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answer them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; did they and their voices were loud .
&quot; could anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an un@@ anim@@ ated and lau@@ gh@@ ing &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. K@@ han concluded with the words : &quot; God be thanks to Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was correct@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ m@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. K@@ han could not find a place more in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican musicians of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
&quot; the music that is played in both locations , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music which lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ b@@ age pon@@ y , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old col@@ onial town , which is very popular among tourists who is very popular , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ c@@ umb@@ onic ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the community : one of children and adults @-@ based sym@@ ph@@ ony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students is for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and ban@@ den violence . &quot;
&quot; but changed this after a random meeting with a French pil@@ ots , who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope . &quot;
the young band members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously that means the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi :
&quot; once they come out of the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run by the st@@ rolling streets to reflect their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come and playing with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute horn , p@@ ong , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from Bu@@ ll
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village , which is practically the top of the largest gar@@ b@@ age pon@@ y of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Par@@ agu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are produced from re@@ ver@@ itable waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ designed instruments , which consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ er under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ ve@@ z , to turn parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ fy viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , guit@@ ars , guit@@ ars , guit@@ ars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ per@@ toire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ ve@@ z , a local ec@@ ologist and music for the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als and we had at the same place to contact the children in the tr@@ ash , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them live with their children . &quot;
the changed as F@@ avi@@ o was something shown that he never had seen before : one made of waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of re@@ produced material and that is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Har@@ m@@ onic &quot; ( harmoni@@ ous gar@@ b@@ age ) features the musical performance on :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the h@@ ass@@ le - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura . Paraguay .
and here they turn him in some beauty .
Land@@ fill Har@@ m@@ onic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from tr@@ ash music around the world .
the Orchestra has played his music even before Pop@@ e Franzis@@ kus :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight against illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was at that time that this ship had already been operated in li@@ beri@@ an waters of illegal fishing fishing before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were here accordingly and little gen@@ dered to welcome a bill of law@@ ful of this kind on their coast .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ized themselves swi@@ ft@@ ly against the ship . they den@@ ied him , one of their ports , and WE@@ IG@@ ER@@ ING also to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply den@@ ied it , &quot; re@@ members of Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an ancient reputation of the Ken@@ yan Fisch@@ erei@@ Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch him fish there .
&quot; finally it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of lo@@ oting of the fisher@@ men of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices protects and resources protects , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are next to Som@@ alia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information out and stand together when it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fish@@ eries is caught by the definition : what is cap@@ tured is hidden ; because of it is extremely difficult to lift up . thus the illegal fishing is a major role of the over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; by the visible abuse of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing eco@@ system can harm a del@@ ic equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fish@@ eries were once affected by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the snap@@ shot , with the information between individual countries so , the actions nowadays are in real @-@ time , with tr@@ ace@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; here , the individual countries can inter@@ ven@@ ge with each other for example lists existing licenses or details that you noticed during a harbour in@@ spec@@ tions or experienced . &quot;
Fish @-@ I followed the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open lake with satellite schedule .
&quot; this makes it possible to draw the authorities , ships used in Forbidden areas . also allow such sus@@ pic@@ ious drivers to discover , that a ship invites its fallen fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in ide@@ al@@ case such investigations can show such investigations if the participating ships have a fish license , where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ alty . &quot;
countries that are against illegal fishing buildings can be found on the basis of this information then the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties like in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owners , what means that the illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , the director of NF@@ DS Africa . latter is a advis@@ er company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
one closed front
&quot; the already called platform was created to win 20 million USD at lost turnover , which att@@ ain the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal fisher@@ men who entered into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive Th@@ un@@ fish species , that attr@@ acts for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also that illegal fisher@@ men . &quot;
&quot; to their practices include actions include the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake @-@ papers , indication of Phantas@@ ms , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you interpre@@ t the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously was a ship illegal fishing and a country could then say &apos; you dar@@ ge my harbour . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ al hat@@ ch try to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its establishment F@@ ISH @-@ I was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ected ships .
&quot; it has been criminal networks covered , the f@@ ake licenses were distributed in Tanzania . it discovered ships that are followed by several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and found fle@@ eing ships and found fle@@ eing ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us rather far into the networks organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
it builds a system to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to make sus@@ pic@@ ious ships .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships who like to hide themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position to hide , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , a NR@@ O who also deals with fisher@@ y data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships are for example of their automatic identification systems which can no longer be counted by satellite .
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps therefore , a system to build a system that connects different information on each other . it is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
an model @-@ program
but F@@ ISH @-@ I &apos;s Team African nations can actually affect the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite phones and can be shown through which the position of each separate ship@@ ments can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together , together with the neigh@@ b@@ ors to get a better picture of which what is doing - this is simply meaning &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and un@@ bund@@ les their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense crimin@@ als , but they also cr@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ships , the earlier without license f@@ ought and hardly expected to count with consequences , now they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries now have a 33 % increase of fish@@ eries , since then fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Som@@ alia had helped to host Gre@@ ko 1 , the In@@ sp@@ ectors found there on board to@@ w , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries notice this successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so great that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study @-@ based . &quot; &quot; in West Africa once more than one hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , for the so called West Africa Task Force . also they fight the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the target , even more such initiatives and structures emer@@ ge in other regions . &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ I &apos;ve been able to report F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s first big tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the way round , and not only the ship was used without a license and were bot@@ her@@ ed to@@ w , which are not b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated to Forbidden waters , which are reserved for fisher@@ men from Som@@ alia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of standards against Gre@@ ko 1 put the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is a further success of many . and at the same time evidence that such special , collabor@@ ative working method works . Emma Bry@@ ce is free of professional journ@@ alist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

particularly large waves carried out the news about political op@@ pression in the central north @-@ north @-@ situated city of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .

&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators to hold the police force , including those woman in the state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;

&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic does the round already makes the extent of op@@ pression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship of the country has op@@ pressed .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a term in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Lab@@ s for this :

here is your revival !
on the street !
&quot; others will evaluate this prot@@ ests as a further step in the fight against a government , which took effect from their view@@ point against the dev@@ ast@@ ating economic crisis and thus rather it has dealt with , critical voices to hide : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and int@@ ensity .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as a meanwhile adult man told Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the framework of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , who ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , who were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
&quot; starting from the peas@@ ant , the same name as his father contribute to the brut@@ al mil@@ estone in prison La Per@@ la that he has been watching over the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years of time he ret@@ ained the family of the family .
in the situation then I believ@@ ed that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , you do not remember that one is manip@@ ulated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ u@@ er and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ or from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state @-@ making , his father was Vice @-@ president of the Secret Doc@@ trine of the Secret Doc@@ trine of the Secret Doc@@ trine of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , which is due to ab@@ duction in 158 cases , tort@@ ure , mur@@ der in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had taken the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had lived as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows that great power has a parent &apos;s child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation .
from the sp@@ orth@@ alle to the military @-@ point
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the Sp@@ orth@@ alle . there I made me with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch you made you with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito revol@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eblo , - Revolu@@ tionary Eth@@ ar@@ me@@ e - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries &quot; parties of Argentina . &quot;
therefore he provided me to go back into the sp@@ orth@@ alle . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would be hearing . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my Father had educ@@ ated me .
at the military base I had to destroy anyone who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , Certificates , prop@@ aganda , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ since they are practic@@ ed the prisoners
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he took me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - stood . &quot;
everything of it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump@@ i silver . &quot;
on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke where the st@@ olen items have been asked and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
and then the prisoners were tort@@ ured .
I died and saw a goat who were tort@@ ured on the people .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
&quot; later I found out that it was att@@ ained by the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was bur@@ ied there . &quot;
&quot; they cap@@ tiv@@ ates a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , covered it with water and hunt him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the gest@@ ure there was dis@@ si@@ vely ... like a dir@@ ty win@@ ch .
&quot; later , when my father stood under house ar@@ rest , the same sm@@ ell was from his room . &quot;
I realized the sm@@ ell immediately and I became clear that the sm@@ ell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this sm@@ ell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible to make man another so much suffering ?
&quot; I knew , that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he carried me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were s@@ lic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , one civ@@ ilians who was also in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses that naked people with the face down - all were in hands and feet .
near the entrance k@@ au@@ ed people still on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father said that I saw to the prisoners he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why hast thou hast brought me away ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thro@@ wn into a tom@@ b and killed by soldiers and bur@@ ied .
I know that because my Father told me about it .
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man coll@@ ectively and kill .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ v@@ ors of civ@@ ilians J@@ orge Rom@@ ero , which was also indi@@ cted to La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to To@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emil@@ io F@@ essia , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former foli@@ c chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way to which you came here , is also the way , which came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then succ@@ eeded in the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they have proven to be part of the process of in@@ hum@@ ment a number .
&quot; when they survi@@ ved the tort@@ ure , the prisoners were thro@@ wn into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be lost . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ cking of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their body in most cases .
the &apos; Dest@@ be@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things with home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they said it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear that the war , a bay@@ onet or perhaps military sus@@ pen@@ es , which one takes an enemy , which one fig@@ hts . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ als , then this is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me how my Father , the manager of the Security Council , with this vote . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also offic@@ er at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie , and I never liked it to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al it all in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you who stop the cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded primarily of anger , made me and cri@@ tic : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you yourself . &quot;
we no one another one !
so my Father was .
I have no only good memory of it .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then I made a jacket and a wheelchair made of cloud . both , my father had made of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a sympathy with this crime had been to be . I ref@@ uted , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to cut out .
&apos;@@ the Sh@@ ell@@ in@@ let of the body is the final final act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find re@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , you realize the value of a life . &quot;
man develops and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; good , you have been ex@@ emp@@ ted during the dictatorship of people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with my home , his mother was killed . &quot;
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
&quot; however , they could have been to be put into prison . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate it , it was just decided to kill these people . but why do their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
had these people not even families where one could have been handed over to their imm@@ ort@@ al over@@ turn ?
the weak@@ ening of the body is the final final act that man ant@@ un can .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they were introduced to eliminate the imm@@ ort@@ al over@@ shad@@ ows of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were sh@@ ining and anywhere else - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains forever .
&quot; I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
only in order to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought that show my father was born during a talk , when he stood under house rest . &quot;
I made him appe@@ aran@@ ces because of all of the ridge that I had to experience .
&quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt intern@@ ally and asked me when the whole over@@ tri@@ pl@@ ateau patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they were suppos@@ edly def@@ ended , actually well . &quot;
then I want :
how can you tell your Soviet ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a terrible crimes and you have to be forced me as a child .
&quot; he ref@@ used only &quot; &quot; Na then me . &quot;
exactly what did I did .
in 2010 I receive the first display .
I finally have recognized that he was a bre@@ wing .
nobody can tell me that I may be taken . I finally told against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under home@@ for@@ rest still standing before the end of the process .
&quot; he was indi@@ cted by 416 beams in 158 cases , tort@@ ure in 154 cases , tort@@ ure in 98 cases , mur@@ der in 98 especially severe cases , tort@@ ure with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping one under 10 @-@ year child . &quot;

&quot; in the Japanese town of Ky@@ oto , customers have been a newly opened center in which one can extend its leader in the last month witness a very reasonable translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word go to &quot; &quot; ( Cor@@ ei@@ ben@@ sha ) , the &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; means , possibly , but also with Bohem@@ ian back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fri@@ ght@@ able drive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was posted on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine which was divided into social media .
&quot; the error was the trans@@ lator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ otos you like . he was also that the loc@@ alization of this was attentive . &quot;
the Ky@@ oto Ky@@ oto Shim@@ bun has wrote :
&quot; how could it come about such an English translation ?
this indicates that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Ky@@ oto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the adequate name &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older motor@@ cyclists &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore , they said that the error had already been described in the text , and that the translation was not checked before it was published before it was published . &quot;
a Blog@@ ger report as follows over the exc@@ use :
&quot; it is sorry that older men felt thanks to the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) to our turn , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast news set itself somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fri@@ ght@@ able &quot; older motor@@ cyclists in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; hor@@ ri@@ ble &quot; was caused as an un@@ reasonable description of the drivers . according to details of the police there are the proportion of Ã¤l@@ der mot@@ ori@@ sts , which are w@@ rap far in acci@@ dents , but quite a reason to worry . &quot;
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto for example were caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19.@@ 460 Un@@ cases by seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused seniors 1.@@ 803 of a total of 11.@@ 850 acci@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; with this , its share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of acci@@ dents is s@@ unken , the proportion of the elderly caused prevent@@ ed un@@ waste in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the name is not called repor@@ ter in the published version of the Article comments to the light , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces are some Japanese se@@ em@@ ingly against older mot@@ ori@@ sts : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fur@@ ious motor@@ cyclists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So , the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; &quot; in all Asia is so common . &quot;
translat@@ ing mistakes are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true fund@@ ant for this vin@@ es bug in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translat@@ ors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to translat@@ ing two important capabilities : passive knowledge knowledge , to understand the initial text and transfer the active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active master@@ y of the target - something that is the case in the mother@@ language of the case . in general , the con@@ vic@@ tion that translat@@ ors will be in the initial language - not in the initial language - mother@@ language should be . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French mat@@ ze@@ ity should translate into French for example from English to French - not from the French into German . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies emplo@@ y no employees with English as native language , the translations into English . this may be attri@@ but@@ ed to the translation of translation , cost , or the relatively small number of English wom@@ ens who wants to learn to be attri@@ but@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who themselves do not have a foreign employees , yet translat@@ ing translations will be made intern@@ ally . then the Japanese staff is considered to be considered the best for translat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ able and r@@ ori@@ ous pro@@ positions that arise through the automated translations , show that this technique has not yet been no human translat@@ ors . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the od@@ d@@ est English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often used T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understand it . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translat@@ ing error like jewelry or at least harm@@ less . but of big companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Ky@@ oto will hopefully use a rep@@ ut@@ ter source for their translations .
Venezuela : prot@@ ests and c@@ ens@@ ored protection on the internet and television

&quot; on the open @-@ day tomorrow , the 7th April , mel@@ an@@ ol@@ ean Internet us@@ ken , that they have no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote other users that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV can no longer be accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online radio broad@@ casting recordings of the prot@@ ests in Car@@ acas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who res@@ et the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
the prot@@ ests started in early April after the Supreme Court rul@@ ed the parliament and trans@@ mit the responsibilities of the Parliament on the Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive and the Supreme Court itself .
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journ@@ alist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ out@@ es . it pointed out that the connection is connected to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ic provider is again block@@ ed .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay products are popular among the dental vene@@ ers with internet access especially in times of un@@ rest .

without cable TV and informative national television channels I registered me at @ viv@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later , that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay due to a blo@@ cking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online radio stations . this also affects the website , on which the national meeting point their sessions . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had result@@ ed that the local internet vend@@ ors will be used by the DNS @-@ server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; when a website is block@@ ed by the DNS , the server respon@@ sive or den@@ ied the request when call for such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS port : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ viv@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;

in Paraguay a lot of girls will be s@@ lave to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ tics . now they visited the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness to other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ tur@@ al .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ tur@@ al which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que CAEN &quot; ( &quot; Fli@@ eg@@ ende KÃ¼@@ he , falling schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and will be re @-@ released . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her academic degree at the University she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
who has become a little then she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as one described in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money sur@@ passes their min@@ der@@ old son , or her husband &apos;s daughter to another , plentiful family . in the exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned it is that the children do not need to afford a countless days to work , which can never be paid and sacri@@ fic@@ es the victims of abuse and mis@@ eries , and all that can not be stopped in the context of a contract . &quot;
this referred to in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after compl@@ eting their studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , a couple of years for an organization that f@@ ought for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they said with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ mel@@ ted stuff , re@@ cher@@ ish and p@@ ran@@ ger@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; they tried to call things on behalf of name , for the feeling of grati@@ tude , which is the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as gei@@ mp@@ ft , guaranteed in general down@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double em@@ bank@@ ment , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who want to join her daughter in faith , making them to improve their position in society and to make something from yourself to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl in itself and whose exploitation will be justified by faith that they would give someone to a chance that otherwise no training would receive and maybe even dism@@ is@@ sed . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl gets sus@@ pic@@ ted , his family will only be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they have never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in hospital , her body showed traces of f@@ ails . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former milit@@ ant Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo that works as offic@@ er at the population .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3.000 residents 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra , as long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they were fat@@ al inj@@ uries . &quot;
this should be the last confirmation in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the inci@@ dent .
they pra@@ ying that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ tic@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical Society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practices for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of s@@ la@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came to prot@@ est sur@@ veys and demand@@ ed that there is no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more co@@ ws as children registered , &quot; compl@@ ain Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to hur@@ t the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a growing examination of the case .
they want that Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo for the mur@@ der on the girl who was sent@@ enced to 30 years im@@ prison@@ ment .
&quot; if the case appear before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n Directive , if the first time in history of Par@@ agu@@ ays will be the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ tics
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as will not only explo@@ ited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old , when the far@@ ol , who worked for her father , and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to go all work and began to sell on the road or on the market sweets to make money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent than Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a in the house of her employer worked Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , they had to share the time so that ye remained in learning . &quot;
she stood every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and enrich@@ ed the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example , they puri@@ fies the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , pol@@ ishing the furniture and des@@ per@@ ated the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .

&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hun@@ gry , but also not un@@ limited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick me more books from the library of the land@@ lord as food from the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belong@@ ed to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was one of the opposition to the opposition to the opposition . &quot;

he tried to convince them to convince the reports of official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he did not judge them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; the land@@ lord had fallen someone who heard about politics , &quot; says them . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would go there again &quot; poor hab@@ its &quot; . with that said they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which would like to speak to the indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ te@@ Ã­ . &quot;

&quot; however , it was totally clear that it was for everything they got from them to pay with their hard work . &quot;

&quot; because the other children have parents know , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ tic@@ ta is . &quot;
I was unable to invite anyone to my home . I had no friend at school or in the neighborhood .

Leg@@ isl@@ ation writes the Egyptian users of social media to register at the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; six@@ ty &quot; &quot; Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed to a bill to &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators on the use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , the user must register as a user name and users of social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is responsible for citizens , citizens and citizens to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months , acceptance of the law would have to register as user name and users on the site of the site with their right names and staff numbers , to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; shall it failed to do this , so this could bring a pun@@ ishment of up to six months of im@@ prison@@ ment or a money @-@ bu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced , which consists of six par@@ rot and included in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; every application that will run via the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video and communic@@ ating text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear that the law is set out if it is assumed , since the draft shall not be assumed , as the Egyptian authorities should not register as those Egyptian government does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media enterprises . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and conveyor of law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received by tele@@ communication and a password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook block block@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to create a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to which would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians , information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
yet it has not been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical with regard to the technical power of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Sustainability Res@@ ologist ) &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I bi @-@ f@@ le strong among the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt related to things which have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they make it so much that as they viol@@ ate the physical public and private rooms , it could be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then this means that they apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and that means a re@@ verse system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it a judgment process . &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the constitu@@ tional committees before it goes into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether his assum@@ ption and enforcement must be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ation is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliament@@ arians T@@ amer El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime , which was planned for gu@@ il@@ ty to gu@@ il@@ ty the &quot; public order to be threat@@ ened , the &quot; public order to be threat@@ ened &quot; and &quot; prot@@ est on prot@@ est . &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of the Ir@@ aks work the shel@@ ter H@@ ana R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq , to protect the spiritual Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ i@@ color ) . overall , it is between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Con@@ servation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are always less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only survi@@ ved cater@@ er in the Kur@@ dish eco@@ system &quot; and the health and the thought of the eco@@ system depends on that there is a big cater@@ er . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ arden actually in the free wild track is low and goes against zero . when the team in video is therefore determined that they have a shot of a big cat in the camer@@ af@@ alle , bri@@ des R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist shows R@@ aza passion@@ ately , a different side of their country , which is not just war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in the field of field studies for six years of animals and involved in the programmes of Nature Iraq .

&quot; in early March 2017 the enti@@ re@@ ed daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the advances made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; &quot; triple disaster &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a viol@@ ent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had trig@@ ger@@ ed the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which lies in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an important pre@@ f@@ ecture of Japan , who had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring regions of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced to disappear throughout the coastal cities of the map .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lived a atom@@ ic accident , already because it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress of six years after that progress has been achieved in order to re@@ build the life of local cities .
the extensive report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( PA ) , &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai kou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ect@@ ures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three sc@@ f@@ ect@@ ures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , on the other Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , one gets stri@@ king still , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated by master@@ ing accommodations ( eg ) , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses . &quot;
after the triple disaster almost 80 000 people are forced to live in claim .
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such complex@@ es . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the year 2011 ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a still live in emergency accommodations , where Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated resi@@ dences were character@@ ised after the disaster in the resi@@ dences , were settled in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected regions
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could be found , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ c@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three c@@ ages are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; during nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i now are back into operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a just 30 percent of the fisher@@ y ports . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident , have pul@@ led in the three sc@@ f@@ ect@@ ures of agricultural land in room@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent de@@ struc@@ tive A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of nuclear un@@ if is , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ cker@@ land@@ es by Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , lie in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ aster &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three sc@@ ales , tourism has returned to tourism again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist area in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a can be found here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal people as more difficult to earn their lives . &quot;
is the indi@@ genous people prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous respon@@ ds under the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of re @-@ bap@@ tiz@@ ing and how their sens@@ ation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in its introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the ort@@ ality resident , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the survey , that still has not been done enough in terms of cat@@ astrop@@ hic prevention . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who had to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ge from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a ev@@ ac@@ uation , &quot;
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also focused their attention to the situation of ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the dev@@ ast@@ y ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phen@@ caused , atom@@ ic un@@ if , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , almost 63 000 people were laid out in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent spare houses . &quot;
&quot; after the booth of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ alties , most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ alties , who still need to re@@ funds for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects . here it is buil@@ ders , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be part of the Olympic Games . &quot;

&quot; if man encounter@@ s people from other countries , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
after a while we often recognize that one more than it appears at first glance .
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives , and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get less attention when they deser@@ ve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to a moment in which they felt very strong with someone over language and borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ s talks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey A@@ you@@ b looks back to his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Bras@@ ilian student at the age of 33 years ago this week was included in the Inten@@ sive station : past Friday took him a police offic@@ er during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide took over millions of prot@@ esters in a Protest@@ ant against au@@ ster@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has studied the sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trauma and several fr@@ ac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors made him this Saturday and have moved him into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local im@@ journ@@ alist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus the spread itself within a few days fast in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police offic@@ ers can be seen with a stroke of stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the inci@@ dent there was the military police force in the Brazilian federal state Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , that Samp@@ ai@@ o was susp@@ ended until the conclusion of the study of the inci@@ dent of the active service susp@@ ended . &quot;
the pictures show the police offic@@ ers like he in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with its head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra be@@ es ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would be a polic@@ eman managed by a prot@@ esters and land on the Inten@@ sive station , his face would see six months long on TV and the whole op@@ pression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , a press channel of media acti@@ vi@@ sts from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz in which one sees how Mat@@ eus are attacked by the police offic@@ ers and share multiple san@@ itation shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also replaced in social networks . &quot;
in the bottom shown clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus at the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , you have used 10,000 Bras@@ ilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) , to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;

pol@@ ishing
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brut@@ al police approaches against prot@@ esters .
&quot; polic@@ emen put at prot@@ ests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had established a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
the student Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via Lou@@ d@@ speaker to do violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
once again the Brazilian media is prot@@ ests by clicking the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a shut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a bro@@ ich glass window , in order to make it illustr@@ ative with a photo of the title illustr@@ ative pages . &quot;
on the other hand the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with one in fire and bus .
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a dis@@ continuous window than over the prot@@ ests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing to report . &quot;
&quot; this must be acknowled@@ ged , if one is strictly necessary against any form of atom@@ ic damage . &quot;
&quot; here , the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an ab@@ sur@@ de , disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical of violence in the military police are replaced by the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confront@@ ation with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the manifest@@ ation of forgotten villages in Cuba

&quot; the economies of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ ali@@ ch , is located in the western Cu@@ ban province May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar levels , regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ ed values on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar mol@@ ds were laid .
&quot; after the awak@@ ening the sugar levels in the region is silent , and the factory lost , and after its facilities , until only the sc@@ af@@ folding made of steel and concrete left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some distin@@ ctive the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and p@@ end@@ ler daily to the factories , which still ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ daten@@ veter@@ an that stands every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar can@@ ter may not ro@@ wed his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar in the east of the region of sugar , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time since they were preserved . &quot;
it was something that he did not expected .
N@@ ene looks exactly as being heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ ali@@ ch the sugar levels would not be kept but the promise was not kept .
&quot; the sugar @-@ industry tre@@ ats the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market praise , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; was the production 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a moti@@ ve for the country in a few decades ago , but the bad harvest are already no new . &quot;
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar pip@@ ing ?
the old railway station of the community looked better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar pip@@ ing industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar mol@@ ds were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea it was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot;
they just left the factories that produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ ves that result@@ ed in such measures , the low productivity of the sugar @-@ plant@@ ations and the sugars rise on the world market . &quot;
&quot; however , the sugar price rose around a decade back . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound remain , according to the 2016 published report by the OECD and FA@@ O , agricultural and dietary organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the Roh@@ st@@ ool export at approx 85 million dollars for the country economies . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will enter into history with safety in history , that were the first words of Cu@@ ban president Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar ym@@ es , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar tube fabrik Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ ali@@ ch on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; if n@@ ene as he is known as a soldi@@ er , about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; frau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; almost all respon@@ ds are the same opinion , not one of them has been informed that the factory was created . &quot;
&quot; to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially dischar@@ ged documents that are only used to parts , which would be removed , the Ad@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could be held every dischar@@ ging . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip Hop Hop to express and get their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses using N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
&quot; young people from the First Nations Communities in all Canada emplo@@ y their themes , which are important for them . they do with Hip Hop Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an Tour since 2014 , work@@ groups mobile Ton@@ studios have direct access to schools and youth centres , to include youth groups , recording , audio and video production and live events . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the P@@ ago@@ gen David Ho@@ d@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Queb@@ ec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thereby increasing that the young participants in discussions like &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ law , or whatever it comes to meaning . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main ones .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of N@@ ebr@@ aska . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o talks in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ m@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example the history of the Highway 16 , also the highway in West kan@@ ada , where almost two do@@ zen usually dis@@ appeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely not clari@@ fied .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the moti@@ ve of a video game , to con@@ vey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences through glob@@ alization . &quot;
many of the songs appeared in indi@@ genous languages although the young people have not always rul@@ ed the languages of the First Nations .
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have been added , the ref@@ rain on cre@@ e is sung . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved took some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , which gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the bottom side of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an stands at the stat@@ rop@@ he is available , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
&quot; sometimes I feel , as would not ever be interested in me . &quot;
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
that is the day where you will take our cr@@ y
because we lost our way in life as a youth ...
but I believe that we will be able to raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and watch the youth as well as our youth
&quot; thus , they can do this , where they are dest@@ ined to the creator . &quot;
in the commentary box provides the reader and fe@@ eder of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has published a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ journal ( which will also be published on his blog and published here with permission . ) :
plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( U@@ BC ) - outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly on the menu is , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( PA ) , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of dishes &quot; ) from any spok@@ es , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry that dedicated to the production of these plastic meals .
&quot; in Tokyo &apos;s district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses , who produce those plas@@ tic dishes , who made the German film@@ makers w@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a before over 20 years . &quot;
for most Japanese are these plastic meals as usual they do not even more notic@@ eable . a new trend turns it today in stri@@ ving cell accessories and other gad@@ gets .
&quot; at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome released der Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ align@@ ed cell phones , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ ing collective objects , as in this case , cool@@ ness : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ ps mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at Tokyo Station .
the new B@@ oom of the Essen@@ ces is becoming increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case a k@@ eless @-@ don ( a popular weekly bowl with seaf@@ ood ) is transformed into a cell phone .
we have found a good use for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) .
this part is also made of this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that sends your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch as an apple , with a cand@@ le for the phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of a growing call into the com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phone and mobile phones allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or Sal@@ mon used , a popular T@@ opp@@ ed that is served with white rich . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can declare my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the One .
this interest in plastic containers can also take a less appe@@ aling form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our new mobile @-@ stand @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice cream .
&quot; in addition , there is also the balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Earrings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried her@@ ds . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Plas@@ tic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the has@@ ht@@ ag # ! ! ) .
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the or@@ thodon@@ tics of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plas@@ tik@@ is actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ v@@ ors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the tou@@ ching &quot; struggle against drug traffic@@ king &quot; in Mexico , the missing and transmis@@ sions were regularly im@@ posed only in statistics . however , it does not reflect the extent of the human trag@@ edy , which brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the Chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after an viol@@ ent inci@@ dent look hardly anyone to the grap@@ es or on communities who have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every body , behind any bone fund , the stories of paying parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds may never be he@@ al . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico the digital project &quot; ap@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug trading will learn &quot; ) to live this sacri@@ fice and stories of people , who in the struggle between the criminal law and cartridges . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threat@@ ened by drug le@@ vers and all municipalities so many kilometers have to drive something like milk to buy . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear lives ) tells us this story .
&quot; Guadal@@ upe is Guadal@@ upe , a father , the every weekend of the tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who believe in only one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their niche . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again on the task that we have made to go , and according to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 ; as he dis@@ appeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on 15th October he ought to be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my Father , but that does not pay it out because that require a ster@@ ity . &quot;
where should we get off ? &quot;
&quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; ap@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; declare , why the project is so important : &quot;
&quot; we do not just have to show the faces that are afraid of the fear . we must show the international community , the frag@@ ile and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; KY@@ HB , a read@@ ess of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution remin@@ ds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
illness and sensor journ@@ alism I have now been known for several years now .
I come past every day at Zeit@@ ungs@@ ki@@ os@@ ken and see the title pages with images that actually only come from a text@@ book for criminal or acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the One , which is dis@@ so@@ cked or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person , who were once belong@@ ed . &quot;
I cannot be valid or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year co@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be big if he is great . and it is also not normal that people songs about the &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ ures &quot; &quot; of the criminal off@@ ences , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they were those who have lost som@@ eb@@ ody who have lost som@@ eb@@ ody and those who are afraid that they have something happened to them . &quot;
I see our weak@@ ness if stories to be mere numbers in a statistics .
&quot; the fact of the people is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people , and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing place that they were justified . &quot;
I think they try to speak of such a trag@@ edi@@ es if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; &quot; Vi@@ er month Er@@ press@@ ung in Haupt@@ stadt@@ .de &quot; . it describes them , such as armed criminal month for month of money from their business , until they had not destroyed the shop but also their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain above never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back again if you are alone . &quot;
hab@@ its have changed to phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
you make her report with the words :
&quot; we want that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they kid@@ n@@ apped or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these fri@@ ght@@ ful days if that would solve my deep @-@ root feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ pt . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journ@@ alist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence succ@@ eeded . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions about how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and man , who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the approxim@@ ate town of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boy of his age whose parents take care of them .
&quot; Bry@@ an is a sc@@ ise and he tells about himself , how to make a egg ko@@ cht , potatoes br@@ akes , tor@@ ti@@ llas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies , who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ akes with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are un@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother dis@@ appeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been over two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody suffering of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Bry@@ an was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bry@@ an was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez the most endanger@@ ed city in the world due to the number of mor@@ se for public safety and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; alone 2010 , the pro@@ sec@@ utor : 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories , that leaves organised crime in Mexico and entered into the soul of the country . &quot;
only few stories live in view of always new Headlines . this project remin@@ ds us of those who we do not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; has established Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in the life , the complex information behind the sin@@ c@@ ated struggle against drug traffic@@ king , which presented the country in the last four decades , in a similar way . &quot;
when a picture of a thousand un@@ true words is worth
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶@@ m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages that he linked , contain pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
the Fak@@ uma check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a sc@@ af@@ folding or dis@@ appointment to dis@@ appointment .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time occurred ? content in social media , regardless of whether true or true , ten@@ ds to continue to exist . &quot;
we take this photo of a terrible un@@ even seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was used to illustr@@ ate trag@@ edi@@ es , trag@@ edi@@ es which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing between picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in Termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - le@@ ug@@ s not the fact that there is abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a gas wag@@ on the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . they came to 230 people . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , of Africa was negl@@ ected to be negl@@ ected and therefore wo@@ ven . the roads in the region have become dangerous lo@@ oms full of stroke too , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; typically , the wag@@ on fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; positions described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ sty houses including a cin@@ em@@ as close to the full of people that was full of the football champion@@ ship . &quot;
houses for@@ ged and boil@@ ed cor@@ ds in the streets are sc@@ attered .
many people were burned to un@@ knowledge .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ gu@@ r @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 2015.@@ Multiple photos of the inci@@ dent form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for this .
it shows rows of co@@ ded body which are excited on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and are not written in the context of the trag@@ edi@@ es , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what is happening in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 K@@ amp@@ er of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the ent@@ leg@@ ed nig@@ eri@@ an villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported by atro@@ cities where they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops have been burned and par@@ ables were in the streets and pra@@ yers .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 up to 2,@@ 000 people have been mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were cap@@ tured , fri@@ shot or bur@@ nt . &quot;
only based on satellite transmission could be represented the following times .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ clari@@ fied but the ar@@ mi@@ stress point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ or and the attempt of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am to win country ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) .
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo back again , when it was acci@@ dent@@ ally presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ ac@@ re to 2,@@ 000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of fail@@ ures ; Africa Check has documented confidence in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was brought for mass@@ ages .
&quot; one step further bring personal comments such as this example , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from San@@ ge joined in conjunction with the de@@ adly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash registration , published by the UN , published by the United Nations search@@ es , rap@@ e and et@@ ching dead , some by com@@ bus@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; while others were reported against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , as the following information presented these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an sau@@ di @-@ Arab news page , who argu@@ ed by the President of Myanmar , mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , they had used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contributions , on the last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source were written , also said Th@@ a S@@ ein lies this statement , but did not cover the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this incorrect coupling reach up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; re@@ curr@@ ing picture &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be cross @-@ crossing . &quot;
an converted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found on 18.@@ 8 billi@@ ons of pictures ( from 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found the occupied picture from the DR Congo very similar .
&quot; they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed the wrong reports , we have tried other attempts to dis@@ es the matur@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; this post that directed to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodo@@ x community , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslim Muslims , the Christians kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site claims that the president of Myanmar Th@@ us have been vac@@ ated , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the k@@ illing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge together . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students , who have been res@@ um@@ ed by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ ola . An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declar@@ es that the image does not origin@@ ate from the notes , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ hi@@ ha@@ di@@ sti@@ cal attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is sought to lead the paper El Pa@@ is that there are connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sle@@ eps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo , negoti@@ ated with this h@@ h@@ h@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims according to the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the An@@ chor@@ us to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were these events , the mut@@ ated in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was f@@ ier@@ ed as a cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and over 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with that in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to focus attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( esian Vo@@ ivo@@ des@@ hip ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , translated it discussion , as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message to which the picture from the DR Congo was included , dis@@ soci@@ ates the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) reveals Tin@@ Eye too , but not more completely res@@ ign@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data agreements with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and negoti@@ ates them via image data associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original mis@@ fort@@ une of 2010 , the image should ultimately be a correct description but the original entry is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are here two strong topics or frames . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the facil@@ itation of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investig@@ ate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if reading these images could no longer be believ@@ able . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are forty people who acci@@ dent@@ ally share the water around a trag@@ edy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ gest@@ ures this mood of the mis@@ sil@@ es and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ ed it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread viol@@ ent images has already been presented in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the back to ack@@ no@@ wledge the images of a conversation , the trag@@ edy will ack@@ no@@ wledge that these images are even demand@@ ed by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that viol@@ ent images readers and audience is des@@ ir@@ able and to take them the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as these study , which under@@ tried , such as rap@@ e media effect to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot of respect to viol@@ ent represent@@ ations in the news media , is fact that they are indisp@@ ensable for today &apos;s news alert . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting because with algorithms , to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to su@@ stain the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; in which a picture is more sug@@ gest@@ ed , which actually can be used in the context or in completely ab@@ usi@@ ve manner . &quot;
any investigation rul@@ er should be considered as well as internationally they can .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ able ( e.g. un@@ translated ) endeav@@ or to make voice @-@ enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not translate at all .
such words are in any language : you express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translat@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply root@@ ed in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ists stu@@ b@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context are required to understand exactly what is shared with that one word . &quot;
these unique words have already collected a whole time in a online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ able &quot; St@@ even B@@ ird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from the exc@@ e@@ lap language of v@@ anu@@ atu as :
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get your parents in recognition of how to endeav@@ our to hold you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik Language , spoken in parts of Brazil as : &quot;

in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they ent@@ san@@ gers other cultures to allow other thought of thought and an@@ gles our Neu@@ g@@ ier@@ de .
&quot; sometimes you can analyze how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show them how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka linked to the worst @-@ cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the isl@@ ative state of Sri Lanka is currently the worst @-@ water @-@ disaster in this decade .
&quot; trig@@ ger@@ ed by Mon@@ sun , which normally occurs at the end of May , are due to strong ra@@ inf@@ all the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ lu O@@ ya , in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic plane of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ od and mu@@ amm@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure residence . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water conditions in some areas went slow . &quot;
health and hygien@@ ists make a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flo@@ od disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water resist@@ ors of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the registry situation .

&quot; also , they have seen a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousands of in@@ quiries and 150 successful boat feed groups for high water and educ@@ ated people for a result . &quot;

photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use In@@ t.@@ Dam@@ als in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust my four year old daughter , she familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we do not call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ et@@ ching we use rights for sex .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain and people , some hold the ic@@ onic image of a woman with he@@ el high , bound by an American flag , others sk@@ int@@ ed par@@ olen against anti @-@ enemy . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot;
I have already carried this entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , which has built up in their performance . &quot;
they need to be mis@@ sed me .
there are more 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , on different kind of art but somehow we will put all in the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , that as I do not live there . &quot;
Ent@@ mus@@ li@@ ze will be
I ste@@ h not alone .
&quot; this even happened to the po@@ et , whose poetry to be sold in America : ru@@ mi . &quot;
which paintings come one into the meaning if you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din ru@@ mi as old was as I am now , he was a or@@ thodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Mu@@ hammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea the religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims from this world . &quot;
&quot; another exists in the reduction of the reduction , Western books already since centuries col@@ oni@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man , the man should fear and the exotic woman who should save it . &quot;
the leaders of the Palestinian scienti@@ st @-@ American researchers Edward S@@ aid lay down the story behind these pictures in the 19@@ 70@@ s .
but these images are still further forward today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued . &quot;
&quot; I have worked three years in the news industry , and I have seen as this powerful , faul@@ ty n@@ arr@@ ative n@@ arr@@ ative our news@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ os over@@ shad@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led to their countries while the USA could not even choose their first female pres@@ idential race . &quot;
&quot; this scar@@ ring f@@ ails to ack@@ no@@ wledge that if French , Muslim women are forced to wear and su@@ icide Arab women in public buildings to cover their entire body that are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercise his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ os weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks that the first Muslim pra@@ yers were spoken on an American ground of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were brought here with s@@ lave @-@ ups . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ os has our collective imagination , deep and faul@@ t@@ ly occupied that often Sik@@ h &apos;s men and children to reach an@@ tim@@ ul@@ li@@ ze attacks and an@@ ik@@ an@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell , and because of the way we tell she is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
belong to 1.9 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create N@@ arr@@ ative who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is f@@ enced to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ os of 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we are discussed here where seven million Muslims have the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are Russian .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .

four decades ago my belong@@ ed parents to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my Father worked hard into the sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ apers of New York ; sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ aper were made by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man K@@ han . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when K@@ han thought the sky@@ lines of the world were re@@ member@@ ed , my parents were bell@@ y Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I un@@ um@@ w@@ ess Muslims and American ?
&quot; sometimes if me wonder why I have no por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , I am - instead of my Muslim her@@ ds to wear all Muslims - &quot; for respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ aster . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze we do not carry all the T@@ ash@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected by almost always for additional safety checks in the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim acti@@ vi@@ sts and inter@@ religious acti@@ vi@@ sts who endeav@@ or to fight widely spread over the Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well trained anti @-@ hos@@ tili@@ osis , t@@ ink @-@ tanks and experts for false information being produced , which is already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manip@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell , and because of the way we tell them , is an anti @-@ hos@@ tility in more than just a stran@@ ger , one woman the head@@ lamp . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visi@@ onal mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social nutri@@ tionists describe religious life , attack them back on the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behaviour might not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bour in the fire , that I am Muslims , if they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air , who separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ end@@ ly rit@@ ual with my daughter , if I put them into my arms cr@@ ad@@ le and their Arab verses , to protect the cor@@ an , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them will repeat three times .
&quot; I ask for that they are protected from evil , evil one can see and evil , which one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my sheep . &quot;

belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother and their sisters like in decades ago a competition of the art of the flower arranged in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the image of her that I see in this moment , when I sle@@ pt my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its full@@ est and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred illustration , a book with lon@@ gest @-@ four@@ teen capit@@ als that it can be almost time @-@ consum@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Muslims signi@@ fies to speak the pra@@ yers , who had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims to be , as they brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my sole Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who was over centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed , which established a company with the name of Hon@@ den@@ y Bri@@ ini@@ dien Com@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God , my sole Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and to hear that men are not w@@ aging , but at the same time to see that my grandfather is we@@ pt . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ dr@@ in , while he writes books on the modern Islam and about the independence Kasch@@ mir@@ s , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ w@@ unden about his family in India domin@@ ates lamin@@ ated family , which he did not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to this is knowing that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , by col@@ oni@@ alists have been sc@@ attered around the Muslim world like at stake risk . &quot;
Muslims to be aware that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to have been col@@ oni@@ zed to the four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first fli@@ p @-@ bom@@ b of history was rej@@ ected in front of a century on a Muslim land .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a indi@@ an , burning sub@@ ordination of British emp@@ ire , from the newspapers called his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were air@@ planes , he travel@@ ed to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radi@@ cal word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my mus@@ lim@@ ian tribe of 1,@@ 7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gree ; our bell@@ y history . &quot;
&quot; it means to remember that four years ago the powerful military of the world , with troops that have gone apart from the Antarc@@ tic , were distributed in Iraq in order to reflect mass destruction . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ s are bur@@ ied under the ruins of the war .
an American Muslims means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate among Veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent in 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a trag@@ edy , the USA is hor@@ ism and the sus@@ pic@@ ious one Muslim names carries more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a fre@@ ed black sl@@ aves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that in two hundred years ago an African Islamic Islam@@ gel@@ at@@ ter called Bil@@ ali Mu@@ hammad failed and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I say , as humans the airports crowded , to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ abi , a Muslim and a journ@@ alist signi@@ fies the in@@ harder Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multi @-@ inde@@ er identi@@ ties , but to fail to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ os of 1,@@ 7 billion bir@@ ths more possibilities than a magic @-@ cube , but it is represented in the reduction of two &quot; &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to worry about my child and to all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that power@@ less and privil@@ eged people on this branch of structural reform . &quot;
structural Islam@@ ists consists in the Muslim registr@@ ations which began with President Bush and carried out under President Obama .
it consists in integrated monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration of immigration , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country , which clos@@ es its bound@@ aries towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and n@@ eb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which is largely Ar@@ aber and Muslims . &quot;
these are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs that we are at Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and due to those who we are not tell , we are today here . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ sc@@ ent of Man , scientists presented a scienti@@ fically unusual image and colorful it , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the low@@ est score .
con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep , coming to the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are decades back to identify the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints , which we are negoti@@ ated in our news groups . &quot;

and that moment has consequences that go out over 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is one reason that con@@ spir@@ its theore@@ tici@@ an that exist in the dark cor@@ ners of the Internet , now the White House will lead . &quot;
they are exp@@ on@@ ential because they have made Muslims to others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ ential , by doing the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years before it had not yet given them ; now they domin@@ ate great regions in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I was not aware of as I was as old as it is now my daughter , but I have made me today to an un@@ cont@@ acted Muslim . &quot;

can there be a possibility here and now despite a language bar@@ rier with someone to join ?
&quot; for St@@ even B@@ ird and Rob@@ yn P@@ erry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the invent@@ ory of stories in their original language a possible answer to it . &quot;
global Vo@@ ices told short about another initiative of St@@ even B@@ ird , the Un@@ translat@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the sc@@ anned word . it is an attempt to get the language diversity of large cities and appreciate . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages not to be passed on there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extin@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoid@@ ed when we can create cities , the diversity of diversity - safe rooms , in which inhabitants do not have to be forgotten . &quot;
&quot; whilst &quot; often related to it is related to understand &quot; &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to cher@@ ish , to feel to feel . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers its history first in their own language before and translate or explain it in English .
&quot; even if the participants are unable to tell a professional history , so conduct their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation that the listen@@ er can be ad@@ mitted to it . &quot;
they call p@@ ses and emotions than the language is no longer a bar@@ rier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain which for their land typical customs of art . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the p@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after he explained the meaning of his banner , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience ? &quot; &quot; he shares your language ? &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard it !
they were attentive ...
you were quite with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project , with T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS to organize their own history . &quot;
puerto Rico is calling for the US re@@ clam@@ ation of the sover@@ eign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ cur@@ sion of public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in 72 million US dollars , participating in the Ber@@ ez@@ em@@ on@@ stration ; the Mar@@ ch started at the Ber@@ ez@@ em@@ on@@ stration ; the march was started at the Inter@@ governmental Capit@@ ol , the Govern@@ ments of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was trig@@ ger@@ ed by the group@@ ing of &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la De@@ uda &quot; ( citizen front for the neur@@ ons of deb@@ ts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ical church Assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the prince of the ren@@ unci@@ ation of deb@@ ts have also submitted a Peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos , that the politicians , hing@@ es and government authorities , which are responsible for deb@@ ts for the debt . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial examination and a pressure committee without personal interests to public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions relevant to which in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressing and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos is going to be gu@@ ilt to bl@@ ame which is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king pension funds .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ speaking territory of the USA - suffer from severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without parties with a focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures will be transferred without the participation and con@@ vic@@ tion of the citizens to be rej@@ ected by the people . &quot;

but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by Sy@@ rian regime , putting his suppor@@ ters and relatives the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year of this year : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is organised in Berlin , the annual event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;

( The cost of freedom : a collective post @-@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book which was published last year and is released here , contains a number of approaches that emplo@@ y themselves with free culture in the face of op@@ pression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction there is :
&quot; this book would like to be re@@ structured , such as movements for freedom of knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; acti@@ vi@@ sts , artist , designer , developer , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for freedom of knowledge , we have worked on page to create about the fo@@ g and create something different from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebr@@ ating Internet volunteers , who has been in@@ feed since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was drawn from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , in which he was on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the intro@@ duct@@ ory portion of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a vote that lay down on his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; see how b@@ ass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us let us begin to think about their own dest@@ iny , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
why have we decided ?
what have we been given in this process of temp@@ wise extreme beli@@ efs ?
the Web@@ Develop@@ ers for open source and digital activity has been in the cu@@ sto@@ dy government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and ag@@ ers@@ tin No@@ ura G@@ ha@@ zi , told that the &quot; military police offic@@ er on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; re@@ mark command@@ ment of his cell in A@@ dra had taken into A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi respon@@ ded , she was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by people who set itself as in@@ si@@ der of the Assad &apos;s government and put them from an all@@ eged death part of their husband . &quot;
his stay and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , the Bass@@ el played a crucial role in that access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ ry Th@@ rew , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps no one of the major cultural prot@@ otype was preced@@ ented as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D @-@ artists around 2005 , in order to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , the way@@ kreu@@ z numerous civil@@ is@@ ations and here mer@@ ge Greek @-@ Roman architect@@ ures with hi@@ es@@ igen traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS all began to put this architecture that is not just the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a timer that will be for the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value . &quot;
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el could not yet close this project so far . &quot;
No@@ ura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I have spent my entire life with them , from freedom to dream and bass , she taught me to embr@@ ace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I enter his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at that even as he was already in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
I learned to read English well to write and speak .
&quot; he always has his knowledge with each shared , who has asked . he has to read other inci@@ dents , English to write and speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smart@@ phones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also brought other in@@ spec@@ tions , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 and her husband , when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and No@@ ura have worked together on the book for a year .
they are dir@@ ty the texts to him when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arab@@ ian into English .

Mozambique : because of corruption condem@@ ned Director of liability again on preced@@ ing po@@ ds
&quot; in combination with wr@@ ath on a cor@@ rupt , where half of his sentence has returned to the workplace in the state appar@@ atus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , the 2008 arrested and 2010 together with four other coun@@ cils because of im@@ prison@@ ment of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) to 22 years ju@@ ice was sent@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; the money par@@ ked out of public funds from Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 board . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza has been released in 2016 because of good guidance and called immediately his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on April 19th then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Assembly of the Republic , who bought the application , there would be no bar@@ riers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , once again his old Po@@ sts , since the company was no discipl@@ ines after his neck . &quot;
&quot; however , hot lots of inhabitants the action is not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , a local institution that sets up for public transparency , distributed in an interview with the Deutsche Welle and Decision of the company , the director of the company : &quot;
&quot; represents a bac@@ kl@@ ash in the fight against corruption and represents the lack of transparency and is even a re@@ verse with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note that also the company should have been initi@@ ated a discipl@@ in@@ ate against the in@@ flamm@@ ation .
&quot; however , the company wei@@ gh a apparent however , and does not pass a proper legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ ance social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and considers the case as &quot; &quot; re@@ warm &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza a competent guy would be advis@@ er , after he was condem@@ ned to a sentence . &quot;
&quot; he could hold ill@@ usions and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ compet@@ ently , he has rede@@ emed to be integrated into the company , he helped to add . &quot;
therefore it is evident : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be gladly paid for its silence .
# # # SP@@ IN@@ NER # # #
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Gu@@ ard@@ kan@@ er and Student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director has no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza from the State is rewar@@ ded because he believ@@ ed him . I cannot believe that one rewar@@ ded someone in such a way that the state has already inv@@ oked so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mur@@ als and to serve the state * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state but instead only itself to the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state when hand it turned out to be an in@@ ex@@ haus@@ tible money and the state himself is not loaded and finally condem@@ ned to a long sentence .
&quot; honest@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewar@@ ded . &quot;
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to re@@ mind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is heard in prison :
&quot; Di@@ ebe belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , will remain in memory for ever more than first independent President in memory , but also as shar@@ p , cat@@ ching and - next - predict@@ ed Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous shows as he was energe@@ tic confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is able to be able , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , for sale . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambi@@ tioned man changes , my experience shows that which is not so . he does not alter the tac@@ tic , but he does not change its ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rej@@ ected :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sent@@ enced to 22 years im@@ prison@@ ment for 10 years and came free .

Facebook blo@@ cking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users to Un@@ fair
the Burm@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means k@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or put@@ ty .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attribution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed
&quot; according to Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their data from the net , because they called the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to human indi@@ genous origins or in general as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or at &quot; &quot; ( in Burm@@ ese Scrip@@ ture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the h@@ ass@@ language in Bur@@ ma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise radi@@ cal nation@@ alistic movements given to the word an extremely valuable k@@ onn@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than h@@ ass@@ speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort , h@@ ass@@ le language in Myanmar , the company has a lot of mean@@ ing@@ ful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not call itself automatically h@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also means , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have the purpose of expression of his use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Burm@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written what the same letters contains , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ ark@@ couple &apos; ( cur@@ tain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ il@@ us@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he was the word of Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in spiritual nature whether they w@@ ast@@ ed , as he made his back pain , as he made a voc@@ abul@@ ary . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on total - res@@ em@@ bles the r@@ attle expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; zin Win is the opinion that they will be radi@@ cal nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook analy@@ tical be scor@@ ed before it all the po@@ sts , spread in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it is filter@@ ed the word automatically .
Autom@@ atis@@ m shall not understand what you are at Fac@@ e@@ ook .
&quot; what it should be instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by changing the words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( put@@ ty ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that this dir@@ ty nation@@ alists , spread the h@@ ass@@ le , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the neck language may dis@@ semin@@ ate the efficiency of this strategy for long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often have a kis@@ sing and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative writing of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at compl@@ aint , such as Facebook started to delete his pot , when he wanted to communicate with his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; of the social network is called : &quot;
&quot; as I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook group that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and me the Li@@ ken , Po@@ sten and parts of contents for 24 hours is prohibited , because the post office is not said to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show off their opinions against the h@@ ass@@ ily radi@@ cal nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail has been removed , who has nothing to do with h@@ ass@@ le : &quot;
post without h@@ ate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author were part of his opinion about why extrem@@ ist nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have to have done before the initiative of the initiative , for example the Burm@@ ese Internet community to ask advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a prosper@@ ous intention , rac@@ ism in Bur@@ ma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words to c@@ ens@@ ored will only bring more h@@ ass within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and as words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they have found that they have made mistakes , they don &apos;t mis@@ sed the ad@@ her@@ ly bra@@ ined po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only had some respect for the 15 million benefits that they would have a large turnover , would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of sp@@ ice among users .
&quot; instead it seriously to take seriously , users now take over Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of h@@ ass@@ language to see whether their Po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screenshots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which have no h@@ ass@@ ump@@ tions , but nevertheless they were removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Burm@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a st@@ ool and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try whether Facebook , the post is removed , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; the post f@@ ails &quot; If you are a doctor , cure then people ? &quot;

in the last five years extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to increase their voices and their influence .
&quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ ing in social networks is to emplo@@ y violence in communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts thousands of them have forced to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been used for failure to insp@@ ire H@@ ass@@ ures H@@ ass@@ ures on its Burm@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; but rather than simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; to z@@ apping , it would have been better on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the children &apos;s children is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 the Parliament adopted by the country , un@@ anim@@ ously decided to ban this practice , so that the hei@@ ght@@ ened age now at 18 is . &quot;
&quot; prior to this amend@@ ment of the spouse ; the brother Har@@ r@@ yp@@ ers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aja , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state is not hous@@ ed , as the , age , age not the matur@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; this happened though , the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has been a contr@@ acting partner for the UN Convention Center , the min@@ ors as , every person under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 were 6.6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statistical Central Office of the country that were married from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online Peti@@ te and Social @-@ Media movements , who stri@@ ves to prevent laws to children &apos;s children , followed by the foot and su@@ cking great support . undoubtedly helped it to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it was not going smooth@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leaders for example had no concerns about the cri@@ tics of the children &apos;s child , they should be dam@@ n even to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition has been caring for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and some@@ time , whether the opposition would be decided at all at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s throw - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the Represent@@ atives - so that he could make a simple majority to make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the President of the country has to agree and pro@@ claimed the law . &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s throw against the children &apos;s vote was decided in the Represent@@ atives of 35 votes for this and not only one against it .
&quot; after previously agreed in the Senate , the draft is now to be the law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was enthusiastic because the laws of the child has finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis ; the d@@ ressed air at the Educ@@ ation@@ in@@ ist@@ erium , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and un@@ necessary sounds , which has spoken out the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s child is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal , and that is almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Ab@@ el Jackson of opinion was , there was definitely long enough to create practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was exc@@ eed@@ ingly happy that the day was finally came : &quot;
&quot; public Status Quo on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which faces : , , Her@@ vor@@ rag@@ end News ! &quot;
the spouse had been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , who belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society , which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law be noted : &quot;
the Holy Age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the Relig@@ ious of 18 years .
&quot; the draft for amend@@ ment of the spouse was today , held on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the Represent@@ atives there are 41 paragrap@@ hs and of which were 35 at the vote .
&quot; all taxes , who were against , have agreed for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s children is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # fi@@ st@@ alli@@ z@@ hi@@ dab@@ use .
many thanks to all the acti@@ vi@@ sts who have lost him .

&quot; but a possible ho@@ ok comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the months of Mah@@ ar@@ aj , Mah@@ ar@@ aja has announced his intention to enter judi@@ cial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be a promise of time . &quot;
&quot; during the general state of Paris Al R@@ aw@@ i , a fe@@ eder of the law , said it is quite right@@ ly , if Mah@@ ar@@ aj against the law , w@@ ished the most social media users , one would need the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell sl@@ ender :
&quot; dear Sat , if we place , instead of keeping the discussion so generally , in a way that the state , our daughters protects that they may be of great , stu@@ b@@ born men that they may be compared to them , they would then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or believe that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to an judi@@ cial procedure against the law or not that legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world , where the children &apos;s legal action or continue to the standard , although there are laws that they are . &quot;

&quot; through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can look back Wikipedia @-@ content . &quot;

created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than one month , Turkey has been shut down the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based En@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day will be significant , as important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information and share . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ter and fans of TV dis@@ crimin@@ als against the blo@@ cking .
&quot; although many Engine@@ er@@ versi@@ fied Internet us@@ eless are used to use the power tools for block@@ ed websites ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , fall most ordinary Wikipedia users not in this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been exhibit@@ ing from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harv@@ ard University , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages which reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages at its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer machine connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is despite legal pro@@ hibition but retri@@ ev@@ able .
in a blogger post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the locking by Wikipedia ) , we put everything to submit snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org . &quot;
IP@@ FS was also carried out that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it is merely a screenshots or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ sol@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to ho@@ e to ho@@ ists when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Podcast :
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror error . &quot;
man g@@ ently to another URL that is not the original is . that what you can then see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server manages the request at the correct Wikipedia , so it is possible to see the content from Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is carried out by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;
a ne@@ pot@@ ic wild@@ life photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for nature conservation .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around you . you were never satisfied . they were w@@ ishing with poor@@ ly positioned moti@@ ves and wash@@ ed colors .
the motiv@@ ated him to bear a camera to wear and try to compreh@@ end the situation .
at that time he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring him to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , gives him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which leads to the attention to Nep@@ t@@ une animal world . &quot;
he described on Facebook as it helps him a great location in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natur@@ ist . what could there be better for a passionate wild@@ life photo ! ! &quot;
&quot; I rested back home as me suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Gai@@ da Lodge ) . he had a call of my Father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ t river would be an Leopard . &quot;
the Fl@@ uss@@ dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my Father had ob@@ serving him and showed me the place on the other side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately began to cr@@ y pictures . &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ t@@ une &apos;s nature , and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ent as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he stood tig@@ ers already from faces : &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately went to us and he ob@@ rt me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals placed Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Con@@ servation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wild@@ life is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and lived mostly in a tent to make pictures of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days lasted it , until he could photograph@@ ed up a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;

this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a updated version was published here as part of a content sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with great care , the name of their husband or even by older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pr@@ on@@ oun or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ades@@ h give women to respect them because of the social expression the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences should they thought the norm to get these practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condem@@ ned off from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a che@@ ver , and desp@@ ised by her family and the village . &quot;
&quot; the tradition to call their wives also not on behalf of name , is also common among men . however , they have far less tru@@ sts to fear when at all , they should not come in this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , tr@@ aten nine women , including Health@@ care personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique gap and became quickly to the main @-@ party theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the enemies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs which exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , and is committed to the construction of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on exposure from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS In@@ fic@@ ated and heads this gap .
she reports like this club a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time at the emb@@ assy inside of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Ro@@ hin@@ i was shown in her discussion , hand@@ craf@@ ted by women who did not call their husband . &quot;
she chose this subject because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem which can easily identify the women .
&quot; the name of her husband is not nois@@ y according to the name of their husband , is a bre@@ eze , which they all have to be rep@@ ain@@ ty and never put into question . &quot;
Ro@@ xi@@ Ry@@ der :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not agree , it is regarded as a background as a woman without Mor@@ al . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply root@@ ed that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning the Ro@@ hin@@ i wanted to have been called Ro@@ hin@@ i , who had never known their husband , at home , when it works at home , how it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband will wei@@ gh a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; practi@@ tioner , my husband , turned to me and said , I don &apos;t give him up by his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage started Ro@@ hin@@ i their first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; had never heard before . some believ@@ ed that it was a good thing because it was important that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Ro@@ hin@@ i showed a video about the problem in U@@ chi@@ ar Pr@@ ades@@ h .
&quot; after the video project , the women had to bring discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i bat each participant in the name of her husband with different emotions - happy that is an@@ gry , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect it ? &quot;
should it be not equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra via the Bre@@ eze of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women the name of their husband . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
a woman was so sh@@ y that they live during the whole exercise just before themselves k@@ ich@@ erte ; a different decided to see the whole fruit against him and his family by moving him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in ad@@ ren@@ aline above , with an old rolls to have broken that they would actually attempt at home to call their husband &apos;s name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
Ro@@ hin@@ i received a variety of reports in the next few days .
the husband called a woman called Ro@@ hin@@ i and asked what ideas she put the women in the head : his wife could not stop his name to his name .
another Club@@ winner decided to do it with dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when their mother @-@ in @-@ mother they were afraid , she got afraid and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i said , I sol@@ le it . &quot;
an em@@ powerment of a participant in was less comp@@ re@@ hen@@ sible and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i reports , how women tried to stop other practices , like for example the tr@@ actor of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red points on the for@@ ehead , which shows the wife : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he also acts it . &quot;
he only lau@@ gh@@ ed and I heard that to wear him .
&quot; the other women do not completely stopped with it , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose to wear it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion will be a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do this in any discussion , a trip . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women make sure who could hear what they could hear , &quot; says them . &quot;
&quot; for the first time she celebr@@ ating her own birth@@ days in her life with cakes ; they dan@@ ces , and san@@ ctu@@ ate over things that they had never had thought before . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have spoken about some things , for example such as our identi@@ ties to our eye@@ wear are never so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things to say , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have been carried only Sar@@ is since their homes .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ tw@@ ist spa , a vast hem@@ d over a tro@@ users , wear ; they have not d@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; according to much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , the Mor@@ al are connected to the sar@@ is and much more , narrow Ro@@ hin@@ i their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Upper inhi@@ bit ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a while they can carry out jeans and ro@@ hin@@ i is sure that they can create it .
&quot; to the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion , I have changed something that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have had only small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times but heard again to say the name of her husband .
&quot; some , included me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are here . &quot;
&quot; only one or two continues to say the name of their husband , only one or two women now carry on any time interest in their for@@ ehead . &quot;
&quot; the women in the discussions will know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ed for more freedom of movement or their own clothes , at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; by doing other self confidence , they will be aware that they are in the same boat . &quot;
like Ro@@ hin@@ i explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this divi@@ de gives each one of us the confidence that will change something .
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain , when every woman goes back home and other people about what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are sitting at the same boat .

this story was originally released on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of in@@ tru@@ th@@ ful Chinese Dis@@ si@@ pres@@ idents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has given attr@@ acted attention to the international community , having been announced in the international community , having been delivered to the hospital in the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sent@@ enced to eleven years im@@ prison@@ ment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State of the Charter ) , having been calling for the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded for his work in 2010 with the No@@ bel Prize .
&quot; the Ministry in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter , and a spok@@ es@@ man told it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to offer views of the international community , the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , sharing or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have cri@@ tic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hus@@ sein , the Hoch@@ com@@ mis@@ sar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , one speaker l@@ acks it , however , whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad for treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have travelled to answer questions about Li@@ us Frei@@ sing .
the relationship between China and Norway geri@@ et to sto@@ k after the No@@ bel Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u although the Norwegian government was that ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway was signed an agreement to record the sal@@ mon practice after China since the exports have been largely block@@ ed since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news was common that Li@@ u was seriously fallen , the No@@ bel Committee brought its hope for an un@@ conditional release to the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick its price in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of its im@@ prison@@ ment , he was not able to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision with China to deliver Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the land@@ ar@@ rest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top @-@ level of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called China also for the release Li@@ us , as she met in an explanation of 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all visits and received , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad , with that the Americans &apos; wish him that he has the opportunity to treatment abroad , in@@ so@@ far it should help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at the US @-@ emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on 27@@ th June , that the message of the Chinese authorities given to release not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their home@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US @-@ message pul@@ led a fur@@ ious response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign affairs that &quot; no land have the right to make a single and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as the freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it aims to claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , J@@ eff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz just introduced a decision in the Congress to pus@@ hing the Chinese government to pus@@ hing Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I requested China to release the No@@ bel Prize # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can provide a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Denmark
&quot; the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will get all the medical support that he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ese appeared on 7 and 8 July at G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could take a visit to Hamburg .
Canada
&quot; on June 28@@ th , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China is requested to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to leave himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us Ms , Li@@ u X@@ ia , every day could visit him every day but the police are not permitted in hospital and that there is Li@@ u not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you about :
&quot; Canada calls for China to allow its international human rights to freedom , including freedom of expression , to preserve the freedom , and to release the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France , France required China in an Declaration on 29@@ th June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments receives , which he needed , regardless of where , he should need to have his wife and family contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news of France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Foreign Ministry was announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately be record . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; in Taiwan , the Council of the Fest@@ land@@ ing issues in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to show Li@@ u and to demonstrate a greater tolerance against those that challenge the peaceful resources to call political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the t@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese Leg@@ isl@@ ative Bran@@ ch European Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the Reg@@ ent Democratic advanc@@ ement Party , China also called on to allow the Si@@ ze@@ al Li@@ u to leave itself in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed itself in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u , and gave that many him asked to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he had strict inten@@ sely , to a harmoni@@ ous , stable and prosper@@ ous China would have helped to have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moving and also encour@@ aged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizen , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or land ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stup@@ id since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the judi@@ cial Minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered in Singapore as a city .
this re@@ mark has trig@@ ger@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ o@@ sphere .
&quot; during the meeting on a meeting of the international branch of the An@@ wal@@ ts@@ kammer association of the State New York not@@ ated the ministers that many people compared the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be seen as a city .
... no one has ques@@ tioned if New York was a democracy ...
&quot; it is , where most people see an error . &quot;
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ erio adopted the judi@@ cial minister , &quot; the logic to negoti@@ ate the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacri@@ fic@@ es to create this valuable land , you can say that we ultimately be no land . &quot;
&quot; it sound@@ clou@@ dy , it had a escape from the rep@@ lication , a mandatory field . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , w@@ eat land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am reasons were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of whose , he appeared un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably und@@ em@@ ocratic . &quot;
&quot; he has been def@@ ended the idea that Singapore with towns such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you arrive at the core point of the topic , the good old body from the author@@ it@@ arian Mach@@ ines to be for@@ give dem@@ ocr@@ ats , leaving the wir@@ es logic , since they are better to fit their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of Shan@@ de@@ den@@ im , the answers were given in the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions are asked with non @-@ answers r@@ ational manner .
&quot; Rach@@ el Z@@ eng requires Sh@@ ug@@ ug@@ am to im@@ pose his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to s@@ wal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore no land , but a city is , so to what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am taking the trouble to res@@ ume this point , unless he was paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog released his comment , he points regarding the cri@@ tics that you should begin to read the entire fellow members of the conference so that you can understand the context of the statements by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am better understand , according to those in Singapore and no land . &quot;
Read the read@@ ings .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; be said than a country , &quot; said , why the elections in Singapore as un@@ equal , even if we are free and just choices . &quot;
he consum@@ ing Singapore with towns in the US ( and how many of these cities saw decades to win a party ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously not meant to be in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is considered a leader of a her@@ b growing generation , such pol@@ emic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the judi@@ cial Minister from Singapore has said , very tast@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I did with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected to do with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I am not even sure whether he really believe , correctly and is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ es the weaknesses of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Argu@@ ments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; gut@@ win a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ dy instruct@@ or ? &quot;
if Singapore is not a country we will only be regarded as an independent and sou@@ ther@@ ing state ?
&quot; if not , in which country go the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the state of government , the statements made by Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Tanz@@ anian role its military service , they only defend their city but not its country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink Staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journal J@@ ourney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have an@@ gry many more expensive ...
nobody ever has said that Singapore is a country .
we always have a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should always speak of the defense of the city .

screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be shown here as part of an ongoing series with ru@@ m@@ ors over certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is ques@@ tioned in Japan most , is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , does me , &quot; &quot; said I then . &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live here and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite , interest in his conversation , by creating personal questions . &quot;
&quot; according to my clari@@ fication then usually the default answered : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rock@@ y Mountains , Ice Hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans are perhaps intern@@ ally before wo@@ ut , if they are held for Americans but not dist@@ ress it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little who diff@@ ers to the Canadian of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian F@@ ahn@@ e F@@ ahn@@ e are visible well on their back@@ pack , if they travel . &quot;
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans go ... .
&quot; it was so already when I began 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the em@@ per@@ ch in Iraq and 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn in their luggage at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ b@@ ors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ gender @-@ sex are legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is also true as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not such as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I h@@ ate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I very ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
I would like to do anything if one would be changed for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; refers to be , basically , sp@@ atial , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure NED Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &apos; ( which has its own can@@ adi@@ c@@ er double ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like NED Fl@@ anders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the actual problem exists that &apos; nice &apos; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no ver@@ tices and ed@@ ges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
harm@@ less being said to be un@@ sight@@ ed and un@@ interesting to make and no attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that are happening around a . &quot;
&quot; I would even go even so far , to say that the desire , free and alone to be , a captain of the Can@@ adi@@ er is . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ going back as &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the f@@ ence over the neigh@@ b@@ ors .
&quot; l@@ acks the warm , open kindness that I have now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our prime minister has made Canada ger@@ ade@@ to sexy .
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ tape has released a music video , which took the Jun@@ ta to restore the power , and despite their promises the civil government , continues to gover@@ n the land . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo colour describes a young man who tells about what rules makes him his girlfriend .
&quot; though no political , the music video refers directly to the continued military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video was divided on Facebook at Facebook and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator was block@@ ed in Thailand , after a group of acti@@ vi@@ sts the public being called to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , in@@ special about how it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta reig@@ n . &quot;
&quot; look at once again these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that have wit@@ ness@@ ed in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; refers to the current section 44 of the Provisi@@ onal Constitution , which is the Supreme constitution , which makes the rul@@ er of absolute decision making an important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; entry change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , acti@@ vi@@ sts , politicians and other people that are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as cri@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to become the acti@@ vi@@ sts and other cri@@ tics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , the online content is monit@@ ored and individuals who thro@@ wn up the mon@@ archy , the mon@@ archy is pursu@@ ed . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ ct@@ ment against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ erti@@ a ) by .
on 20 May 2014 the war was launched in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy , is their decision expensive sub@@ boats to buy , although security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a w@@ ast@@ ing of tax burden . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even shown how people will be thro@@ wn into a black product cars , before they bring them into an inter@@ ni@@ fying camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they have suppos@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and internet @-@ used will attack long ar@@ stance , they should bust@@ le the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the songs members of the band , which was used to the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; , which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the prot@@ ests 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the post@@ war society is very slowly in East @-@ South@@ east Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; it has been officially over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ chas@@ ed war has been officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show market images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ aya , Py@@ at@@ aya Sh@@ ak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , sh@@ iny , Georgi@@ an and Armen@@ i@@ ans lived and worked to so@@ c@@ ari@@ sts in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Rus@@ sians and bott@@ oms live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ch@@ Asia as well as Spirit cities .
&quot; in the pre@@ war period , there were more than 10.000 people today , today there are only a few hundred people in these host@@ ages . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district 16.@@ 000 people , after they had hardly been increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story liv@@ ings of the Soviet Union were named in the early 60@@ s , the Chr@@ usch@@ t@@ end@@ kow@@ kas are symbo@@ lic of the decline and the dev@@ ast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fall and quite rare they are inhab@@ ited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha I met a local older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were common centers , schools and kindergart@@ ens , who are all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence @-@ buildings .
&quot; people who lived once in this place , and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have already abandoned the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha are living about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people living in Ak@@ ar@@ mara , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ usch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which is still one or two families can accommodate you to the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move immediately back . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to us that we have photograph@@ ed us , &quot; says one of the girl . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl fle@@ eing their girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining @-@ company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sector economy ( cultivation of land@@ ed products for the pec@@ uli@@ arities ) such as Vi@@ eh@@ breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come about the rounds .

Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance from her daughter and assi@@ sted that they instead support their young grand@@ children .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get to everything , &quot;

&quot; we do not be afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has always something to do with pl@@ ot@@ ments . &quot;
after the war there were no work and all lived like it was right .
I remember that the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our talk to the end , a little boy is over us past . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy to him behind it .
he plays with the ball , which then hin@@ der the hill . &quot;
a group children is now pursu@@ ing the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw out of the falling building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for un@@ certainty in their lives .
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey

this article from Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way to migrants , the Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is guided by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ al @-@ pink glasses and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ous form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ is@@ ula . nevertheless they know many under the name M@@ om Africa .
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it has become a goal for Afri@@ kan@@ er and Hai@@ ti@@ ans , which are on the transit . &quot;
the hotel has rather have no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 million the night sleeping guests sleep in simple rooms , with k@@ ish , round@@ ed walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the pre@@ ference there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no san@@ ctu@@ atory to the hotel - still coming hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immig@@ rants .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom Africa ? &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also sle@@ pt out on boxes . &quot;
you want to decline to anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to hospital if they are ill , they bought them medications that they cannot pay them with a bal@@ m that ex@@ haus@@ tive from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if mom Africa was an appropriate top name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) positive with Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; answers he with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who come to Boston to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ kan@@ ers who are on the way to the United States , normal to take a first stop in South America and then move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other way@@ men of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ kan@@ er often travel together the route and that to talk to Afri@@ kan@@ ers on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his dis@@ semin@@ aries , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and has worked as buil@@ ders on construction companies in the Olympic Games and the football world champion@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at M@@ um Africa : he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; answers he smil@@ ing . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that their guests should send their most often text messages if they continue to gr@@ asp them or to report her on the course of their journey .
it declar@@ es that their Christian faith of the drive of their work was .
&quot; they do not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her , chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps here very well @-@ known but it is not the only spar@@ kl@@ ing hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter has taken Valencia and welcomed his family migrants in her small house .
it is polic@@ eman and has established that the B@@ usti@@ cket to be sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
at the moment are 25 people there are mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans .
&quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette . &quot;
Valencia declar@@ es that he knows what the guests per@@ ish .
&quot; I lived in the United States , he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have cross the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived three years , he was referred to a raid in his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
&quot; JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he was flown out in Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to have money out of him , without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he has in demand for an accommodation and an unknown , an allergi@@ es , has offered him an roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still there , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa is all full of guests .
in the gas@@ kets the passengers take quiet on their phones .
a small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests brought a large part of Som@@ alia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems to be happy that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of which we away . &quot;
like an st@@ ol@@ ze grand@@ mother bl@@ ame them in their album with numerous pictures .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair , which has made her a Kund@@ la , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travellers more , young and Alte . &quot;
they lau@@ gh@@ s sad , while she presents them briefly . &quot;
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeat them every time . &quot;
&quot; China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their hand , an surveillance app . &quot;
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users based on ä¸­@@ æ ( BC )
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their hand . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 received the mobile @-@ users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ q@@ i , in which they pro@@ ves the district government to install an surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in this release , the app is said to get access to terror@@ ist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed , shortly after they had replaced the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police mind that the app has to determine the sources and distribution paths of terr@@ ori@@ sts and pursue them , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; dam@@ aging information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ su Tele@@ com . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ing porno@@ graphic web pages , of online frau@@ d , Tro@@ jan@@ ets and ph@@ ishing pages to make users spend how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with the filter for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; government actors or even h@@ acker may be able to manip@@ ulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , be@@ ast@@ ed ethnic minorities , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , arrange the authorities often extreme conditions and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet procedures . &quot;
&quot; this is based on Twitter @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from &quot; China &quot; ( visited Spain ) , the c@@ ens@@ ored news presented in China , showed photos of a ch@@ eckl@@ point where the police are un@@ matched to the police , whether they have installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ano make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile messages that the people will install the App within 10 days .
&quot; if you are det@@ ected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be taken up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a bac@@ kl@@ ash for technological development .
&quot; they have comp@@ elled the people , devices that are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the awak@@ ening technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( visited Spain ) , has published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the mark@@ ings requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore receive unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s Parties to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal contents .
&quot; all government @-@ government authorities , authorities and the associated institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the directions of Cy@@ bers@@ ec@@ urity Office on the operation of their computer and communication equipment . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an US American human rights organisation , mentioned this new surveillance of methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ q@@ i , a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , cell@@ phones , external drives , not@@ able hard dis@@ ks , not@@ ebooks and media cards &quot; in local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terror@@ ist videos &quot; &quot; identify and destroy the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible purpose , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death part 1 : all write to death

&quot; this is the first of six reports in series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Sy@@ rian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and adju@@ sting you that you &apos;re very alone in a place where all the most important dis@@ appeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has ris@@ en according to and after dis@@ solved and a truth , that is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all honour .
one that has displ@@ ac@@ ed to a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that does not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes , and the performers - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and all cr@@ y after death . &quot;
&quot; any doubt solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught up on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ ls . you will clear that you have caught here between the walls , which have your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to have established stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my Father three times , but this still don &apos;t get my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the head of the security , it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time a pleasure would become a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us that he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were consci@@ ously classi@@ fied during a peaceful prot@@ ests as we@@ ed out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it is made , so that the city is the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; sh@@ afts . &quot;
&quot; all the districts , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , ra@@ iny , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city that is up to ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organisms and their comp@@ ac@@ ces . &quot;
in the third night things had a special so@@ othing after the power supply in the neighbor@@ ing area .
&quot; I made the still@@ ness , by adding several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends narro@@ wing to me ; we gave us a pra@@ ised image , that of my expectations full and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ ed the Spirit from the lamp , but it just interested in the bar@@ rier . &quot;
&quot; I received a call of my Father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you made them all the way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ob@@ ass@@ an Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ob@@ ass@@ an Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me listen to how you &apos;re &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ able &apos; , or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to write , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ay @-@ filled eyes are looking forward to me .
&quot; and you feel genuine what to look into my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old ; it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
&quot; maybe it was on my go@@ ness , van@@ ity . perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I did not think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I believe I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fat@@ al consequences for me , and yet , I am not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; if it is in individual , and his Father is equal to that . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frame of this promise set it lies until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a syn@@ drome , &quot; a spiritual tort@@ ure that I was exposed to the monthly . &quot;
I made the yard .
in the first office I let everything back with me .
&quot; afterwards , again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I pre@@ me all the details just before I enter the room .
&quot; other than otherwise , they have probably divided me a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with just one another prisoners , and may immediately put me immediately without having said on their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a couple of minutes , who left themselves as a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I return to a old @-@ proven communication methods : with the F@@ aust against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ os@@ se was a &quot; salvation &quot; was .
after a long time he answered me finally .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man middle aged , who is similar to me and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the perfection of darkness do not release a distin@@ ctive facial species and doctors are not here : we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to his existence .
perhaps he was lost in one of the big cells .
perhaps he is immediately rever@@ sible .
&quot; the medi@@ ator had been in@@ sured , they would certainly release him when I stay . &quot;
li@@ me .
&quot; if I &apos;d like to have a bird @-@ bit , to dri@@ ft all this cro@@ w , which stret@@ ches to the fruits in the garden of my head laboratories . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 am in the evening ; always about this time , the bar@@ row , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black saw the colour of mind , until I saw the light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; d@@ ger , &quot; on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
&quot; you are here , to hear . &quot;
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state security before us , and prevent the tra@@ it@@ or and terr@@ ori@@ sts in us , speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tical dial@@ ect - so they played their den@@ omin@@ ational stor@@ ms from and out@@ dated the narrow point of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , that is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that call it co@@ existence to transform the crime of their kne@@ lan@@ s into a her@@ oes . &quot;
&quot; I enter the hearing and tre@@ ffe on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and ste@@ ady man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expres@@ sions , who are un@@ fortun@@ ate to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join this Tag@@ edi@@ c and to prot@@ est to demonstrations , which anyway will find an end soon . &quot;
I answered not .
&quot; I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed , not to answer . &quot;
I really cannot say more exactly when ins@@ ults and blow@@ s have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to be mis@@ led or mis@@ sible , although I had done nothing to earn these pun@@ ishment . &quot;
an pen@@ alty in all its diversity .
its command is to gre@@ et me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; gest@@ ures . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that is probably from the clo@@ ves .
your H@@ enk@@ er erg@@ om@@ eters in your cr@@ y .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot hold your sheep . &quot;
&quot; my che@@ qu@@ ests were not yet enough , which is why they exchange the tube through a cable . &quot;
when I asked myself whether the medi@@ ator had worked earlier times as gar@@ b@@ age coll@@ ector or if this was the normal working equipment .
&quot; they had four cable connected to each other , to present us , from their view , great in@@ vention of a huge cab@@ s to present . &quot;
within a single hour three of them rarely come from them while I was still in the row .
&quot; I lost all my body in my body , and also my voice , which I still listen to cr@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ enk@@ er not@@ ched the cooling , and there was no wick@@ ed to all of them , which is why it is known as a neigh@@ bour to an electric drive . &quot;
&quot; current through my entire body , enough to supply my entire neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ nu@@ de body , the stret@@ ched on the ground was the perfect power conduct@@ or . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness dis@@ appeared and the pain was back again .
after two hor@@ ri@@ ble hours he decided that he met his duty for that night .
this must be so around mid@@ night .
&quot; I decided to sleep , to lay down again , we say that was my only option . &quot;
some hours for@@ got that I came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning fulfilled the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an ex@@ haus@@ tible young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be trou@@ bled worried . &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ gone you , you will be lost . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had left me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ ano Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ ates over the rights of LGB@@ T + -@@ community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoke a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ver@@ ge the bulk of his time inside ; times he so@@ ils to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but how to leave itself is a cigar@@ ette between his fing@@ ers or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine lips .
&quot; he lives on the top of his family house , which was founded in 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to fle@@ e out of their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as a rocky one ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity , which is the conserv@@ ative majority , and their alt@@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and ha@@ unting . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often relate to themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian society . all these topics do not only find in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relev@@ ance but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria until after San@@ aa in Y@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by bound@@ aries and he can feel according to their own statement by people who have to suffer from the dev@@ ast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , the Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
even if he didn &apos;t open it openly against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded from the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in consci@@ ence to do anything in the second generation - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan , and never before it was never in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions so , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he sh@@ aken at water Nes@@ ma in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise until sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anian law also act that the public intake of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an illegal is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weak@@ ness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sens@@ ory hot young boy with prot@@ est against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the mu@@ st@@ les are warm coffee and the weak@@ ens of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose , first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jordan is like a prison under the open sky above all , if one thro@@ ws a look into the neighbor@@ ing countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is avoid@@ ed it easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an Water - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the State of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has made a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary members , who support the Islamic Ak@@ tiv Front - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of hom@@ osexu@@ als Front@@ be@@ ers Ham@@ ed S@@ inn@@ o , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and be the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the members and former spok@@ es@@ person in the Islamic co@@ alition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many in addition , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab@@ ian spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which represents the alt@@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ arian reg@@ in@@ timacy in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement by M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ters of human rights , &quot; which is still decided to emplo@@ y a intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be probably not simply sei@@ zed rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a more clearly demonstr@@ ating cryst@@ alli@@ zation reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional Sex@@ ch@@ tern@@ or@@ men by suffering , moving his vision of the fate of the Arab women who have c@@ ited sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of an apparently Dutch @-@ made woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the cor@@ ners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through hands , which they actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ orary mor@@ ro@@ de &apos; was arrested - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch won the number of Hon@@ orary mor@@ de in 2016 their peak ; however , it still occurs , that Jordan is lack@@ ing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have sacri@@ fic@@ ed victims of mur@@ der or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for the bre@@ asts of the year 1954 women , which are exposed to a certain time in prison , and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic expendi@@ ture as well as the guarantee of the family needed , that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is delighted with great popularity and is known for it , also not before subjects to re@@ treat that in his country as t@@ abo@@ o g@@ old . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b cont@@ ests that his work is politically , however , that he is his music , the full of exp@@ lic@@ it@@ res on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression is not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle , man . &quot;
&quot; he was heard politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; lies the focus again on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeat@@ edly repeated :
&quot; you are free , and each other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian people and that comments on Equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ Individu@@ als have been strongly increased until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments has been tor@@ n out of the context , and in his opinion were c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a registered version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T + -@@ Community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against hom@@ os@@ exual did not give Islam to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which still remained in mind thanks to his homogen@@ e@@ ous po@@ ems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ask yourself : if Abu Nu@@ what was going to work later on behalf of the cali@@ bre , in the eighth century openly about hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing was said with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
in H@@ ash@@ emi@@ tic Kingdom it is nothing new that the government &apos;s attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought into silence .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anian mess@@ enger service has firmly root@@ ed several former government members and members of the teacher , with the grounds , they have had attri@@ but@@ ed to the problems in social media that mer@@ ged with the deep in the land . &quot;
&quot; given the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , which is only the top of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous gene and taking . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now sees a performance in a row , but the way of progress - so it is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ time and intern@@ ally change . he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he did not only dreams his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; maybe the region will approach the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness , and not by bom@@ bs , aspir@@ ation and on artificial kind of dem@@ ocr@@ acies . at least hopes he . &quot;
&quot; until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to be res@@ in and therefore also resistance . &quot;
this report was made by the Pul@@ it@@ zer Center on Crisis Reporting allows the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , extr@@ av@@ ag@@ ant cri@@ s are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous the@@ ories in regard to the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
&quot; you susp@@ ected that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas To@@ ho@@ kus . a further theory was wor@@ sen , in the ar@@ mi@@ sts of the West J@@ ap@@ ans in the north @-@ east of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to make some great ben@@ ches , so we have a super view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help to promote Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legi@@ timate profession like the hair@@ line . &quot;
&quot; el Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s major port , is located at the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rates , where road smo@@ ker and illegal drugs use are daily . &quot;
&quot; one in April 2017 released a survey , that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe . &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aes@@ thetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hairdres@@ sers of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , who can make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hairdres@@ sers that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ style &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts around each other to show who from them can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ oo@@ ks can be created , as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions can be found on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like school August@@ o Sal@@ azar B@@ ond@@ y , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people of it to find their weapons against hair@@ d@@ ressing tools and instead of bad advice to find a training in the hair@@ d@@ ressing art that allows them to find job . &quot;
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the benef@@ ici@@ aries have seen do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered before the school &apos;s school year special training workshops and reported about some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : lov@@ emaking to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ amp@@ er

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the published version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ schaften in Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ amp@@ er , which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only lov@@ emaking to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel extin@@ ct , aff@@ ection opposite ? &quot;
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian acti@@ vi@@ sts Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Stiftung Not more out of the head and insp@@ ected them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ c@@ ili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters to reconc@@ iliation ) to write young people to write gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ers .
&quot; only in short , her country was setting part of a historical event and she wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ater F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Arm@@ ed For@@ mer ) , which forms the batt@@ les of the lon@@ gest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international is the under@@ lying of the peace of peace be as significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos for his services received the peace @-@ prize prize .
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , however , is still a long way to see from real reconc@@ iliation and peace . &quot;
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ amp@@ er that lived for many years in illegal camps that were exposed to a war het@@ ero@@ gene@@ alog@@ y and integrate their weapons coming into life as civ@@ ilians .
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa , they must take them into their ranks and support them when building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian will close together and help with the integration process .
and exactly this they did : until now they have written thousands of young people letters - lov@@ ings to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ amp@@ ers to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 69@@ 00 letters - one for any former gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ers - which should then be personally handed over .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconc@@ iliation was created at the World summit of Peace Prize Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there had Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an the possibility to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the peace of peace . &quot;
&quot; stated that we love the people who we love , am Valent@@ ine &apos;s thousands of lov@@ emaking , but those forgotten it much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , told it further to share in this year his love with people who needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; so the plan , letters was full of hope and support for former fight@@ ers of F@@ ARC , which now have to build their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a united history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , within the framework of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolum@@ ba as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ranqu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I never had thought , that someone would for@@ give me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo raised by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art in the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
members of the F@@ ARC set themselves as it had done earlier to accept the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not received a command@@ ment , but letters of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything , what was in between , and told the policy of Jim@@ en@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra is a employee of the Govern@@ or of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca . this unforgettable experience so :
&quot; after we had passed the letters , led me a former fight@@ ers through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fight@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; when I saw one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ er@@ illa live ) saw , I saw a Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ amp@@ er that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him was a M@@ GL gran@@ ting , a fat@@ al weapon in the Dorn@@ th@@ enia wor@@ m . &quot;
&quot; I said him to and asked him , &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; I said to a letter that anyone has written someone . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life som@@ eb@@ ody has written something so beautiful , so I answered him . as he suddenly answered me the te@@ ars over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I wat@@ ched him very firm and set me next to the gran@@ ules .
&quot; maybe he was sorry for the war , it was sorry , all the years of faithful companion to be this fight@@ ers and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . I have never thought him and his six brethren before fam@@ ine . I had never thought that someone would for@@ give me to my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society where it is waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now I learned only , as I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as war and the F@@ ARC already remained in conc@@ eal@@ ment .
&quot; the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the leaders of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views beyond the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to a political party in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people heard that so far had never found hearing and no choices had seen , and even believ@@ ed that people have often seen as monster and even h@@ ate , even people have been se@@ aled by their habitat and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot;
&quot; reality , in which the country lives , does me s@@ ore me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfort@@ ed me that all humans - also , who have killed and so much damage caused to bring us something and can give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fight@@ ers have answered on the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote to Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was made that after the dr@@ af@@ ing peace would be glori@@ fied .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and to prot@@ est for their rights . and that &apos;s also totally justified . &quot;
we stand by the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without arms . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ ender of peace on - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong@@ ed - to rise above all that of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacri@@ fice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are forth@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was written by un@@ s@@ rem partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ ova and its initial publication on the website OC Media took place . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - among other discrimination , physical and sexual violence and em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement . &quot;
&quot; with scar@@ f acti@@ vi@@ sts have experienced the reporting of the past months over the persecution of Schw@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ yan men . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which depends on the dor@@ sal LGB@@ TI community , is not only emerged above the night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a tran@@ sit@@ ing woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who has shared some of their experiences with us and told us what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has been con@@ qu@@ ered several months ago , after reports published were published , tort@@ ure , tort@@ ure , and k@@ illing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ ed . &quot;
the first report was published by the journ@@ alist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took sus@@ pic@@ king que@@ er men and put them in the secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there . &quot;
already since her childhood she had noticed that she was in reality a woman was .
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ etsch@@ ans had experienced by the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
out of fear about their life they moved the final end to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunte@@ er hel@@ pl@@ ed in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone would need my help .
&quot; it was a familiar from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which in difficulty plug . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help you get someone of whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he bought them at his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , which can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
then they made the photos of my documents using the very W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I &apos;ve just been doing a few shopping street from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male , saying , &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned off , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ ap : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honor the family again , du Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that there was a young man not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke the final end in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started off .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambulance .
in hospital I learned that I had two tags in my right gap .
OC Media : in which n@@ ood@@ les have you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated since there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor was tr@@ apped and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I got his name for the first time at his office , I got to do with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ m , a k@@ au@@ cas@@ ian name . &quot;
but it turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got Dro@@ h@@ ings .
&quot; they ri@@ ef@@ en me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the requested to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they set ab@@ sur@@ de demands : some told me , I kis@@ ses to point out by the streets without the streets of Fig ; others wanted that I was not am@@ ended on the official television in Gro@@ sn@@ y and say that I was not just worse , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have a body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole Republic has sh@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; we can not stir@@ ring you , because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neigh@@ b@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with removable cl@@ amps and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; after the third time it was happened , I became clear that there was something laz@@ y . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ veri@@ fied the numbers of numbers - it turned out that I was pursu@@ ed .
OC Media : how did you go ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of acti@@ vi@@ sts .
&quot; for security reasons I want to do their name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then it happened to something completely . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought her , without register without giving me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I bro@@ ke my old SI@@ M card and cast it into the tr@@ ash .
came to and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was on a for@@ eig@@ ners .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not think about , you warm@@ ed in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know already , in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family or in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , about the gender equality , we are not talking , this is a tab@@ ular topic . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements I still tr@@ ace in me .
so much I also wish to make this spiritual bar@@ rier I cannot overcome .
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hur@@ t them . &quot;
&quot; when we hop@@ ing with camera , I really give me trouble , as the person looks like that it remin@@ ds out of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed in ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I last week a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I need current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I sp@@ ake with someone who has inser@@ ted the one @-@ half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an no people were arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an , and he concluded a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that my I , they probably load the relative , these take care of the problem with the concerned person and in the end require a proof of that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ung . &quot;
OC Media : are now still dr@@ illed men in this sec@@ rec@@ y ?
Sab@@ rina : a conf@@ using of me says there was not very many .
&quot; if , then above all such that have no we@@ alth@@ y relatives or they were dropped from their relatives to face the cat@@ ching court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that you can present them later as terr@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; say , they should be re@@ brought them to show off their body on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military support . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply dis@@ appeared , but targeted to radi@@ c@@ alis@@ e . &quot;
OC Media : is now only one mut@@ iny or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just zi@@ pped someone over the one @-@ half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people appeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them easy .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was itself , as these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as a ban@@ di@@ ts , there were so far no reports . we were there yet , that such actions are possible at all times . &quot;
why otherwise it could not allowed these people to sh@@ ave ?
&quot; know if this persec@@ utions and dism@@ is@@ ations of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I made my hair too long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe in 2003 I was already lived in Gro@@ sn@@ y as I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria I had never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ ization &quot; , &quot; but has finally been thro@@ wn back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria @-@ Law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were bap@@ tis@@ ed ; I had colored eyelashes , made tu@@ be@@ ad and short lo@@ ops . &quot;
the security @-@ in@@ ist@@ erium of the mal@@ aria has never been curved to me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theater in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially to weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city did not know ; they knew why men , young people , there sle@@ pt . &quot;
we were never treated .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ verse : K@@ hard@@ a ma K@@ hard@@ a . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if which make himself funny .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply put her eyes off your eyes , because they believ@@ ed , you are si@@ ck ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never inv@@ oked me , never f@@ ails , and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this gr@@ ac@@ ed time ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : so long , up to K@@ ady@@ ro@@ v to the plan entered . &quot;
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on television about Mor@@ al . &quot;
&quot; he not spoke about us , but on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people in the city could get to change . &quot;
&quot; who previously mentioned and kept up , consider yourself at once with Ar@@ g@@ wo@@ hn . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic is ste@@ adily closed . &quot;
OC Media : what job do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not see much - 700 to 800 dollar per month in the USA are not much .
that apart from that I am still active as an acti@@ vis@@ tin .
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 mus@@ lim@@ ian women . &quot;
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , cont@@ ests , I accompanied them to hospital and help them to get rid of them . &quot;
I had no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people as I s@@ orted out @-@ out .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you contribute to Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ location .
&quot; so nature , this is purely nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as ro@@ pl@@ ums who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ s have which Rus@@ sians are which the Rus@@ sians are also which ; on the whole planet there is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is not un@@ pleasant , sow@@ ing . &quot;
I am faithful here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims that go into the mos@@ que and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an f@@ asten - live with men .
&quot; know that many think of Transi@@ tional identity on men who love men , and they believe that man changes to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ ction . &quot;
these are two different things - two different kinds of sens@@ ation to be exactly to be different ways .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not to be ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply knows that I now am .
local groups war@@ ns in front of an increase of self @-@ mur@@ der within the armed Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iran@@ ian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from un@@ usually high unemployment rate and ar@@ mut@@ ation rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mur@@ der .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the dist@@ ressing situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he d@@ welt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he lit@@ t under anxiety , depression , and he h@@ amm@@ ed for his own aid to come up the im@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an@@ onym@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video gave the moments , after he had led himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was transferred to the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
local springs were the bur@@ ns so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only self @-@ mur@@ der that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and acti@@ vi@@ sts in front of the spot that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ aw@@ i , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - depends on . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family owned by the pursuit of the Iran@@ ian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ table made their families to nour@@ ish and a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , in which a majority of Iran &apos;s living in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community settled , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it the native Arab population is difficult to ride their lives . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy , took over and 1925 major efforts to stop the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the next oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most vulner@@ able and valuable commercial areas for the Iran@@ ian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly and the domestic population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and indisp@@ ensable . &quot;
the Iran@@ ian regime den@@ ied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ atically work in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dem@@ ons built , the water of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these com@@ bs have only led to destroy the dev@@ ast@@ ation in the region through dro@@ ught and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Mo@@ h@@ amm@@ ed P@@ ur , the Iran@@ ian Con@@ struct@@ or for Cooperation , work and social welfare , that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is completed a job , 55 % a further school finished and 45 % a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iran@@ ian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and raci@@ al eth@@ os discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; &quot; number of su@@ icide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new an@@ coming ethnic pers@@ u@@ ders and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process :
&quot; since its functional and institutions are preferred to adjust the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to labour market opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit national resistance of young ar@@ aber and to force them to earn their lives outside of their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their preferences and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab@@ ian names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arab language or the te@@ ar Arab@@ ian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to bear , propose human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the location explo@@ sive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world will be up and take note of it .
the main reason for self @-@ mur@@ der is un@@ treated depression .
Depression is treat@@ able and self @-@ mur@@ der is avoid@@ able .

&quot; the following article is an revised version of opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide , and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a Femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who character@@ iz@@ es themselves as inter @-@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally be all femin@@ ist .
&quot; for example , women nowadays are even less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they may do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epi@@ dem@@ ic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards are still providing that women sooner or later in various areas of life on a gl@@ ac@@ ed ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex still attr@@ acts across the many different countries and credi@@ bility . &quot;
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I have to speak on skin colour , on black CIS women , on black mig@@ rant women , on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have mis@@ sed , on what kind we have physi@@ cally , spiritual and Verbal miss@@ ile , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , made a lot of white femin@@ ists and white inter @-@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all of them should come together that women - all women - come together to lift &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ bay@@ a , my Lord &apos; to singen &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that there are in addition to sex@@ ually violence a institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ated violence , which we are exposed black women on two @-@ fold manner . &quot;
&quot; or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ es , and origin of origin deser@@ ve less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school will be referred to as white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership is suffering , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men and at all human beings do not con@@ clude the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman does not arise in their mind , which relate to the gender and the skin colour of one person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white femin@@ ist oriented sphere , who has always been rej@@ ected me and countless other black women and again and again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner com@@ kl@@ ed 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I wei@@ gh me to justi@@ fy an ideology , in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I wei@@ gh me to join me groups , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs , to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to present white women the importance of the cuts of skin colour and gender equality . for some of them will continue to place the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ secondary femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different approaches , and dis@@ semin@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I said it to release me full of femin@@ ism , and join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman into life , rather than being stu@@ b@@ born that inter@@ phy@@ tot@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas , and give us into the spher@@ es that are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson We@@ ems , the author of the book Af@@ ric@@ ana ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves back in which it is completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be taught to make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ secondary femin@@ ists immediately will call separ@@ atis@@ m and exclusion after they have read this lines , please inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , where the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this par@@ adi@@ g@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this par@@ adi@@ g@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can be prevent@@ ed in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ unc@@ ing against the pol@@ lution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - mostly with surf@@ board or in Can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to become aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentation of Emil@@ y K@@ ins@@ key we follow Mus@@ a which explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pol@@ lution to its con@@ gregation .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust absor@@ bs , pol@@ lution and un@@ controlled development , to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ ep@@ ers Iraq - an affiliate of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting yourself and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources .
&quot; at the end of the video summar@@ ize the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y K@@ ins@@ key , one in Er@@ bil , produced in Iraq and multimedia journ@@ alist , produced , film@@ ed and published . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and worked release of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tur@@ al . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # female ) that reported on the dis@@ sem@@ ination against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the persons involved .
&quot; a polic@@ eman said Ad@@ a B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partner who has become active against their viol@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of its relationship was a bit time passed and the police said , her statement would not be placed about the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena , showed also the ak@@ ten@@ able display of Ad@@ a B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
several days later the second wife went back to her ad .
the de@@ vil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women at all once again , they are generally no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many inst@@ ances , women are also dependent on the men that they must be mis@@ sed . this explains why only 20 % of all women who have to ad@@ mit victims of violence at all at the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
ingredients and Statisti@@ cs and Statisti@@ cs In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that nothing is imm@@ ick 3 Par@@ agu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of batt@@ les and statistics . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , resear@@ cher for Gen@@ der@@ exploring the Centro de Document@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a soci@@ o @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , but not even ans@@ sen the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however the figures available are al@@ alar@@ ming .
in 2015 at the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence . at 70 % of it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads came to the police of women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the displays 40 % of women , that they have become physi@@ cally mis@@ led , 55 % of women were diagnos@@ ed by psych@@ ic failure . &quot;
but these statistics reve@@ al not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the statements of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Frauen@@ erin Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i are actually shown quite a few of these off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure to be rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed , coming 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed because of physical mis@@ eries , two women who do not do this , &quot; declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s mur@@ der has no own pen@@ alties , the criminal authorities can not be properly documented how many women are mur@@ dered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s mur@@ der in the country . &quot;
coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates dies in Paraguay every ten days a woman due to violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that nothing is made
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning it did not want to do this , but after . this should it be forever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years they carried out the mental violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would once again become victims of failure .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women have happened to sub@@ mis@@ sed , because they dec@@ ei@@ ve themselves from viol@@ ent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the failure by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote them contributions on Facebook , in which they describe his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their second @-@ year relationship and told , as he had isolated them isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people answered on their contributions , including Carlos herself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric , whether he has ever raised the hand against them , and consec@@ rated that his behaviour also has a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook @-@ users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen so long from Carlos and left him not before . &quot;
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that the victims of failure at least had some complic@@ ity to it .
Victoria San@@ tos that does not origin@@ ate from Paraguay to prove almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they are sus@@ pic@@ ted .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all victims of failure .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , to listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as Fall began all with psych@@ ic failure .
&quot; her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner made it eventually even to convince them , that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as Anzeigen at the authorities remained without the result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against their former partners who developed to an im@@ pen@@ dic@@ able fight between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
par@@ agu@@ ays laws : good approach to def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of mis@@ eries is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , looks also great problems using the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ E@@ llas ( # FÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
&quot; this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International . &quot;
the original litter of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a pec@@ uli@@ ar def@@ ences and to be t@@ ough@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legislative text was changed in some points to obtain the members of the law that thus endor@@ sed the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , the currently in Paraguay are generally prohibited and pun@@ ished with up to five years ju@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had provided , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) travel costs that have to carry the victims of violence by itself , if it simply want to provide to display and provide a secure accommodation with the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law cannot be effective if the bill does not provide any adequate financial resources for this site :
in Paraguay is seen as part of human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking needs to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as somewhat normal . &quot;
those in view of these facts are not gu@@ il@@ ty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are free of charge .
&quot; we have to refund so long ad , until failure is no longer than normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law has been modified . thereby , among other things , the partners have been changed in cases of domestic violence towards reconc@@ iliation . &quot;
the opinions on changes go apart .
the section concerning reconc@@ iliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ress@@ or and his sacri@@ fic@@ es again .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law shall be regarded as a great deal . &quot;
this article is the short@@ ened and printed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tur@@ al . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # female ) that reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the persons involved .

&quot; the Court of App@@ eal was also the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees himself as before attacks by the om@@ orian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the exchange of information was extended by the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information provided by &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three additional months and what the minister announced another time against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal the publication of the newspaper once again . &quot;
the and@@ ern@@ ing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom has been hur@@ t .
&quot; for further violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the im@@ prison@@ ment of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf of Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ ic authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j straight and un@@ conditional release ;
2. a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists of their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er 2016 in Zambia , image is done with his permission . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media in the media . it is a growing section that is one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need to cross @-@ run medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of the global health system many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases like AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the investigation of these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; second@@ ly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be convey@@ ed for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er is Director of Central Reser@@ vation at the Center for investigation of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew in Lus@@ aka in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially as the AIDS Epi@@ dem@@ ic &apos;s first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself on the HIV virus , before it decided to go home to go home to the sam@@ b@@ ische healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. war@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about these research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. war@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . in doing so I support the sam@@ b@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with lab@@ eling tests .
&quot; in addition , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think about the important current science activities in your country and in general ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research . we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers , instead of himself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where comes the funding and support ?
is it suff@@ iciently ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from USA and Europe .
the projects are differently well funded .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or here , because the funding and development are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not con@@ clude the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
Labor@@ material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , how should it focus and how can we support the development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all ages .
&quot; there are demand for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scienti@@ st in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; R@@ W : often the limited speed , things to do , and the public access to scientific expertise , which are facing challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited the amount of ord@@ able information and speed of research . &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ Produc@@ ers are changing global food production
&quot; this article from Rach@@ el C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank M@@ orton has been argu@@ ed since the 198@@ 0s in the United States of Sal@@ at .
&quot; his company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant , cultiv@@ ated by NA@@ SA @-@ ast@@ ron@@ aut in the space and consum@@ ed . &quot;
nearly 20 years of M@@ ort@@ ons was only performed by his own in@@ ven@@ tiveness and the question how many sal@@ at@@ oms can get bound@@ aries .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he pointed out that more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he could not use it further on the bre@@ wer@@ ies .
&quot; the pat@@ ente are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or gre@@ gate or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more such patents have been registered in more plants like cer@@ e@@ als or cartridge varieties . due to this trend ensure the plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and experts for nutrition security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia ancient tradition fe@@ ared M@@ orton still sal@@ ad , he has now needs no longer , because his work is always worth more and more and more . &quot;
&quot; it is , when would lie in a river a rock . &quot;
&quot; so we must do this now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition . &quot; &quot; I think that these patents on sal@@ ads are too far away . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand before judgment , no longer a new sal@@ ad bre@@ eders , because all features are already pat@@ ented , so it &apos;s as good as possible and tried to see those characteristics , which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is however very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property . &quot;
he also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source . ( &quot; open source &quot; ) .
&quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ght of the International Sp@@ aces of IS@@ S , the red RÃ¶@@ mers@@ al@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; the station fe@@ ared and e@@ aten there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

it is no co@@ inci@@ dence that this name is rather like this name looks like the movement out of the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software and provides the alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software .
&quot; it was launched to life , to ensure that some plant species and gene is not protected as a intellectual property and thus be permanently available for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , in short O@@ ssi , the US bre@@ eders can commit themselves that others can be used by them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to make business with their seed , and they can use it . &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders merely permit others to bre@@ ed their own varieties , and it is not immediately utili@@ zed - two aspects that b@@ anned by many plant pat@@ ente . &quot;
do@@ zen bre@@ eder and seeds have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
dark prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ssi @-@ Mem@@ bers@@ member of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , and the possibility to bre@@ ed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds plays a role in larger compositions such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutri@@ tional system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to use the latter or only little by using seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be pat@@ ented whether fruits , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or mon@@ g@@ to and Bayer are announced that in August or September 2016 , it should know that the way for example , it should know how this vegetable is re@@ ared , threat@@ ened , is threat@@ ened . &quot;
dietary sou@@ ther@@ ism without strings @-@ sou@@ ther@@ ism is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will also under@@ take their seed , other their seed can continue to be free in contrast to pat@@ enting seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ssi @-@ suppor@@ ters argu@@ ing that the future of food supplies is endanger@@ ed , since the available com@@ pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights to plant material that is thus always available to shr@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Emb@@ assi@@ sts in O@@ ssi , has been associated with gene@@ tic variation at carr@@ ots and availability . they found out that about one third of all Kart@@ ot@@ ten@@ sions as intellectual property is protected by allowing it to be used for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates yet not , but experts like Lu@@ by ver@@ m@@ bers that mass@@ ac@@ ulate plants as wheat in even greater style are pat@@ ented as sal@@ ad or car@@ ot@@ tos . &quot;
a question of view
plants are so ge@@ ared to prove it targeted features - from such a person through which their tastes or their color improves up to those who are treated in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or disease .
opponent of patents on plant qualities point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is currently taking more patents than ever before since the changing conditions are much worse predict@@ able by climate change .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail recognize Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ In Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that gene@@ tic diversity are generally important and also decisive for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ es and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural sector of the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , it is reflected in the view that intellectual property forms other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant variation innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that can be followed , once the patent is exp@@ i@@ red . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions will help others to come with another method for the same outcome . &quot;
&quot; such protection inhi@@ bits therefore innovations not , but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; M@@ orton sees the different : 20 years to wait , until a patent of bap@@ tism , is certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for such a long time , to bre@@ wer@@ ed to plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions , the fight would have already lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main plant for M@@ orton is that gene@@ tic resources have always been a general public and still remain in : &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will not be impossible if we continue to use the best and latest gene@@ tic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , M@@ orton is disturb@@ ing to pat@@ ron in a total concept : &quot; &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself . &quot;
the plants alike form them out and as bre@@ eder we ultimately have no idea as the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ ssi @-@ Board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who has been a variety of plant breeding , ch@@ ats her own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ o@@ ultur@@ es , for their cultivation of her@@ bi@@ ci@@ de needed , the bre@@ ed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that remain on international markets , but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents without to survive the most smaller saun@@ as , even without patents , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank M@@ orton is looking for in his breeding @-@ garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
&quot; M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eders through the prevention of plant pat@@ ented innovative would : &quot; &quot; it looks like me , when I think with my efforts , new to produce more than businesses that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog as I know that my competitors are selling for my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected 20 years ahead of competition , what one makes it really beautiful . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be in the &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding leader , the concept stret@@ ches now rapidly over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre of sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resource , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; seed staff works together with farmers and helps them to bre@@ ed new varieties , to meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open source &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately constitute a form @-@ form and legal form of the O@@ ssi obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country because of the O@@ ssi obligation is not easy one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented by the present practice of the European Patent At@@ tor@@ ts , the patents on conventional plants were allowed . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is at the governments of Member States to bring the pat@@ ent@@ ance to put this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organize a conference to &quot; open source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seeds from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters and the worldwide trend for the orientation of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systeme explains that the organization is currently a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems , for the planned next year of the official start @-@ committee . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ ro@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity together in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of eating , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . it represents the opportunity to improve it and improve the seed policy , hence a stable supply of food safety can be assured . &quot;
&quot; in the report also the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems st@@ resses - a connection that will be recognized by the Lu@@ by by O@@ ssi that it will soon know more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has prepared mainly on it , where and how something cultiv@@ ated , and seed systems have hardly played a role played , so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; we now try to sound the people even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the latest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still con@@ fin@@ ed to the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time I met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around 05 August the Egyptian Government has documented the website of Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August published the network an opinion on Facebook , in which it is un@@ shar@@ p the Egyptian authorities for this step shar@@ p and condem@@ n the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Sur@@ ge - despite this attack , and the constitution by the authorities should defend and pursue a voice in this part of the world , so it was never as difficult as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome the locking and not ad@@ mit . we persi@@ sted to continue our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first dis@@ advant@@ ageous website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cking the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar @-@ men@@ de network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era &quot; to all@@ eged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ cams to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ D@@ S@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I also consists on the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sten and human rights , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer access in Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles that he is not accessible for in Egypt &apos;s web sites and media .
&quot; now the blog was directed , he set up to handle the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ appar@@ atus of the Egyptian government , even goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blog@@ ger , the provider of which is also heated to Si@@ adas . however , it is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journ@@ alist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he took over the student prot@@ ests as well as the police physical violence against two students . &quot;
its article relate mainly for politics and human rights in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada is expressed by the government and refl@@ ecting what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to sperr@@ en is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ cking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succ@@ eeded to give me the feeling of an ins@@ ect to give me the feeling of a direct mur@@ der ; an inheritance to the national security Council , the blo@@ cking blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proven that I have not written . in other words : my words have influence even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles in order to deal with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have block@@ ed him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the po@@ ci@@ ous walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this includes technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
af@@ te documented the blo@@ cking of vend@@ ors to be possible by the lev@@ elling of Intern@@ etz@@ en@@ sur and private Sur@@ veys possible to so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
af@@ ted reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the locking of websites , the V@@ PN@@ s will be offering , began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and to filter on the Egyptian User access .
&quot; the situation will additionally be mer@@ ged , that the condition decisions are made behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population has no legal basis to help prevent the trial against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and to whom will they attack them next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

&quot; day for Day report newspapers in all Brazil with dark Headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the two @-@ largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these Headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old school was shot in school , &quot; &quot; J@@ ed second day becomes a polic@@ eman in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe T@@ ires 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ftw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis , and in a ten@@ se financial situation reached the force of violence in Rio to the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
Brazilian NGOs Global Justice has even called the UN to access the United Nations .
reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a locom@@ otive magazine .
&quot; so published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they in@@ quired , a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published .
the moti@@ ves for their decision declared the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like Mor@@ se , Rau@@ l , Sexu@@ al@@ ver@@ breaking , etc. all what happens from civil@@ ized standard and what only happened in Rio in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four@@ fold video , which was shared on Facebook , declared Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision is no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war bri@@ ds in a country that don &apos;t realize the war .

in the editorial writes the newspaper further :
&quot; we realize that a war class when he consum@@ ed , even though he can be used , gr@@ aff@@ ection of the police , which is only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to negoti@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
are the term &quot; war &quot; more than they are useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journ@@ alist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against violence as &quot; war &quot; . in their opinion , the violence and could make it sh@@ all@@ ing , responsible for the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - how extra when the analysis of the military installations in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , clari@@ fication and a historic and self @-@ negl@@ ect negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;

he writes :
&quot; besides legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war are also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this is calling for the state on means of funds and ways , which is typical for a war . this includes the penetration in the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is a un@@ shar@@ p point in the countryside and is the object for &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; . &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rian learning to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Sy@@ rian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many sy@@ rian cities suffer from brut@@ al Bel@@ ag@@ ation and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad &apos;s regime towards lo@@ yal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Si@@ ege Watch , a joint initiative of peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Institute Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib , currently around one million Sy@@ ri@@ ans in a state of exposure . &quot;
&quot; especially strongly affected is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 life called hundreds of civ@@ ilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Sy@@ rian opposition go from , based on studies of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad has been ex@@ ert@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by re@@ bel controlled areas outside of Damascus , what led to that inhabitants are dependent on local or through tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measures , a group of Sy@@ rian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; vi@@ bran@@ t food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ ga@@ da and carry the project together with NGOs Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria and are just extremely rare part of the Sy@@ rian cuisine . their nutri@@ ent power makes it an attractive food quality for many occasions of the bel@@ ag@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of pilgri@@ ms , because they have a high nutri@@ ent value , similar to meat , and because you can see them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , this project was well @-@ known and express@@ es its relief that it gets more and more &apos; to conversion . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ ga@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned , 125 families of knowledge about the reproduction of pilgri@@ ms to con@@ vey , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of its anticip@@ ated Zi@@ els of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continuing donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on gener@@ ators that can keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ f will be used locally from plastic containers in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of from the Regi@@ ons , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
then they had a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this yellow , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; teacher for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have found mushrooms throughout the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the pilgri@@ ms from different reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking of exposure . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to gain new food . &quot;
&quot; new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to her home .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea into the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and the ability to become visible . &quot;
we want that our experience inspired people in times of crisis and we can help humanity .

&quot; after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;

&quot; to these issues are added that the website of the civilian code of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident information sought or distributed , relatives to contact , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative to provide the population with information : you have used the own civil@@ isation data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ s the population in real time via the location and the spread of the fir@@ es .

during a night in autumn 1994 the con@@ quest of the Af@@ gh@@ ans began through the Tali@@ ban .
&quot; two years previously was a fri@@ ght@@ ful civil war between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , who had defe@@ ated the short @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a land of ter@@ ror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; right to this time &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year Jun@@ ge , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother was then not so told , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even never anymore . &quot;
in da@@ wn the boy should be stopped .
his un@@ cle would bring him and bring him to the to@@ w .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ates Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was just mur@@ dered by the Tali@@ ban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly un@@ protected . &quot;
the Tali@@ ban known in Haz@@ ara well came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the land towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape found A@@ pro@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a Ko@@ hl@@ eg@@ ru@@ be . the work was hard and made him si@@ ck .
&quot; then he took the what from its low re@@ ward was left , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wing s@@ acks with mur@@ derer , the heavy ones as he himself to earn their lives . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Af@@ gh@@ an refugees was characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; re@@ minded itself A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services and no heating . we susp@@ ended nyl@@ on in front of the open windows so that we do not fail .
after four years A@@ pro@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe .
&quot; in the dangerous passage of the sea , he depart@@ ures and stran@@ ger on a small , un@@ inhab@@ ited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rej@@ ected his asylum seek@@ ers , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went to a church that were twice a day to need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it corresponds to Italy due to relatively high surveillance quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for rej@@ ected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true but also that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country can be found , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is hous@@ ed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special performance centers . this is about impro@@ vised establ@@ ishments in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ imagin@@ able staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a record centre , if it officially released a request for asylum seek@@ er , which may be hin@@ der after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; until then people who have no money proved to have accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so erg@@ ing it also an@@ shar@@ af .
but his unbeliev@@ able life @-@ w@@ ille helped to liber@@ ate itself soon from these conditions .
&quot; after spending several years made various works in the construction sector , thre@@ aded A@@ wh@@ ites its entire savings into the creation of a youth hostels in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that he went after a while still a second hostel and a snap@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
the film was awarded by the Venice City Award in 2017 and was awarded for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Af@@ gh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Af@@ gh@@ ans developed companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to its restaurant Ori@@ ent Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the ch@@ arities of mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Af@@ gh@@ an , Ira@@ q@@ i , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Af@@ gh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali K@@ han Q@@ dre@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and an Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome .
&quot; however , A@@ spir@@ its aims are far enough to leave the Italian gastronomy and the retail and aim to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also opportunities &quot; , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn and improve their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful ent@@ repren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand for stability and prosperity . &quot;

&quot; users need to use social networks within six months of successful legislation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name , as well as its output number . &quot;
who suffered this step up to six months of im@@ prison@@ ment or to be condem@@ ned up to six months of im@@ prison@@ ment .

&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean for up to three years in prison for the condem@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and reconc@@ iliation of freedom of expression has been in danger for many years . &quot;
