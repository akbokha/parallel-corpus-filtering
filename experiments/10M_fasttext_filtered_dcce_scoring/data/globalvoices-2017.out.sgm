<seg id="1">I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, have read American music and operated with his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I became mainly of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as 14-year, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a furious reporter who were conspiracy of a oil stomach with the help of Julia Roberts, who were the top German Court with judgment, who wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to method Man," me was' s, as if the absolute truth is, vergiss all others, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration had even more reinforced for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity so welcoming is that you are always the fact that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very annoying love of his size written.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his involvement.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his opinion behind the mountain as you are as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague it express, and explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afrous and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and agreed in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices, which he won in the republican pre-elections, the highest number that ever achieved by the party of nominee candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigotte person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not met Trump and his voters not with the people who had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist programms, people from all over the world will take a deep faithful person, with whom I could have talked about Islam and past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also animated Trumps World vivid not with the by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati inquirer "," overthrow. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, who are fighting for her life long and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still fits them to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, their wise advice has helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and that through them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump its way to the nominee presidential Presidency, they used to give me a dog and the counterpart to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, the presidency, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the examination of the idea that people have agreed for Trump because they were either part of his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair the Trump voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"people to enter, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful and respectful, and indicates an imentability to understand those who act on another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities do not take into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have agreed upon which most white are agreed for Trump because they would like to recover control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who knows the cruel decision to raise a man who look with contempt on those who look differently from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" (.).: as much as "support of the White against all other ethnies"; vocabulary of white in excess on the whites and whiplash, as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has made so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerless idea - what belief or background we always like, America welcomes every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenyan his story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election Donald Trumps gives a huge part of the white voice of this promise, and says: to hell, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is on the Ruder they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldiers, who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a logiveness for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a vocal change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, could my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the quantity answered with a loud" "no" "!"</seg>
<seg id="50">Would Muslims have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" breasts the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answer them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" did they and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an unanimated and laughing "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God be thanks to Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place more in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was at that time that this ship had already been operated in liberian waters of illegal fishing fishing before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were here accordingly and little gendered to welcome a bill of lawful of this kind on their coast.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves swiftly against the ship. they denied him, one of their ports, and WEIGERING also to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply denied it, "remembers of Benedict Kiilu, an ancient reputation of the Kenyan FischereiAuthority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch him fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of looting of the fishermen of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices protects and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "that we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information out and stand together when it is about illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fisheries is caught by the definition: what is captured is hidden; because of it is extremely difficult to lift up. thus the illegal fishing is a major role of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the visible abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm a delic equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fisheries were once affected by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snapshot, with the information between individual countries so, the actions nowadays are in real-time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"here, the individual countries can intervenge with each other for example lists existing licenses or details that you noticed during a harbour inspections or experienced."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-I followed the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open lake with satellite schedule.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to draw the authorities, ships used in Forbidden areas. also allow such suspicious drivers to discover, that a ship invites its fallen fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in idealcase such investigations can show such investigations if the participating ships have a fish license, where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a penalty."</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing buildings can be found on the basis of this information then the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties like in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owners, what means that the illegal fishing is no longer worth it."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, the director of NFDS Africa. latter is a adviser company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">One closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already called platform was created to win 20 million USD at lost turnover, which attain the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who entered into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive Thunfish species, that attracts for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also that illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"to their practices include actions include the sailing under false flag, fake-papers, indication of Phantasms, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you interpret the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-complete control system", "says Long." "previously was a ship illegal fishing and a country could then say 'you darge my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Comm to me'." "and exactly this legal hatch try to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its establishment FISH-I was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has been criminal networks covered, the fake licenses were distributed in Tanzania. it discovered ships that are followed by several fraudulent identities, and found fleeing ships and found fleeing ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our studies lead us rather far into the networks organised crime", "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system to help the FISH-i to make suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships who like to hide themselves."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position to hide, "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO who also deals with fishery data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships are for example of their automatic identification systems which can no longer be counted by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps therefore, a system to build a system that connects different information on each other. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">An model-program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-I's Team African nations can actually affect the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that provides satellite phones and can be shown through which the position of each separate shipments can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together, together with the neighbors to get a better picture of which what is doing - this is simply meaning "," says it. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and unbundles their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but they also cry."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, the earlier without license fought and hardly expected to count with consequences, now they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the participating countries participating in FISH-i participating countries now have a 33% increase of fisheries, since then fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to host Greko 1, the Inspectors found there on board tow, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries notice this successes." "the effect is so great that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study-based." "in West Africa once more than one hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries together in 2015, for the so called West Africa Task Force. also they fight the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model like FISH-i." "With security is the target, even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions." "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-I've been able to report FISH-i's first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the way round, and not only the ship was used without a license and were bothered tow, which are not banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated to Forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of standards against Greko 1 put the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing." "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is a further success of many. and at the same time evidence that such special, collaborative working method works. Emma Bryce is free of professional journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translating two important capabilities: passive knowledge knowledge, to understand the initial text and transfer the active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active mastery of the target - something that is the case in the motherlanguage of the case. in general, the conviction that translators will be in the initial language - not in the initial language - motherlanguage should be."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as native language, the translations into English. this may be attributed to the translation of translation, cost, or the relatively small number of English womens who wants to learn to be attributed."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who themselves do not have a foreign employees, yet translating translations will be made internally. then the Japanese staff is considered to be considered the best for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrable and rorious propositions that arise through the automated translations, show that this technique has not yet been no human translators. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the oddest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often used T-shirts or pockets, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understand it."</seg>

<seg id="782">"sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the One, which is dissocked or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person, who were once belonged."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be valid or consider this as normal.</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year coousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) will be big if he is great. and it is also not normal that people songs about the" "Heldentures" "of the criminal offences, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they were those who have lost somebody who have lost somebody and those who are afraid that they have something happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories to be mere numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the fact of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people, and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring place that they were justified."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak of such a tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" "Vier month Erpressung in Hauptstadt.de". it describes them, such as armed criminal month for month of money from their business, until they had not destroyed the shop but also their family apart. "</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the approximate town of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boy of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unsignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said to him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been over two years ago, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody suffering of his father saw, which was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"as Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>

<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or at" "(in Burmese Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hasslanguage in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise radical nationalistic movements given to the word an extremely valuable konnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists than hassspeech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort, hassle language in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself does not call itself automatically hassment."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also means, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have the purpose of expression of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>

<seg id="1310">"the good is that this dirty nationalists, spread the hassle, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now it is time to circumcised its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the neck language may disseminate the efficiency of this strategy for long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often have a kissing and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat complaint, such as Facebook started to delete his pot, when he wanted to communicate with his friends that the word 'Kalar' of the social network is called:"</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a prosperous intention, racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censored will only bring more hass within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and as words as" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>

<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports, how women tried to stop other practices, like for example the tractor of the zinnoberred points on the forehead, which shows the wife:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he also acts it."</seg>

<seg id="1517">"the other women do not completely stopped with it, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion will be a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do this in any discussion, a trip."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women make sure who could hear what they could hear," says them. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"for the first time she celebrating her own birthdays in her life with cakes; they dances, and sanctuate over things that they had never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have spoken about some things, for example such as our identities to our eyewear are never so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things to say, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried only Saris since their homes.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a saltwist spa, a vast hemd over a trousers, wear; they have not dashed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"according to much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes, the Moral are connected to the saris and much more, narrow Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Upper inhibit) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa while they can carry out jeans and rohini is sure that they can create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion, I have changed something that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have had only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but heard again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, included me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are here."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"only one or two continues to say the name of their husband, only one or two women now carry on any time interest in their forehead."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussions will know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the Feiled for more freedom of movement or their own clothes, at the end of a difficult to navigating river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by doing other self confidence, they will be aware that they are in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">Like Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this divide gives each one of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain, when every woman goes back home and other people about what we talk and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapisula. nevertheless they know many under the name Mom Africa.</seg>

<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather have no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 million the night sleeping guests sleep in simple rooms, with kish, rounded walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the preference there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>

<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms RamÃ­rez, the people tells people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa? "</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who come to Boston to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Afrikaners who are on the way to the United States, normal to take a first stop in South America and then move toward the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other waymen of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and Afrikaner often travel together the route and that to talk to Afrikaners on WhatsApp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants, who travels through Tapachula, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>

<seg id="1970">This app with the filter for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "government actors or even hacker may be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, beasted ethnic minorities, such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib verge the bulk of his time inside; times he soils to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But how to leave itself is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top of his family house, which was founded in 1967; the year, in which Israel ended its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee out of their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as a rocky one (approximately: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib is a passionate activity, which is the conservative majority, and their altproven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and haunting."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often relate to themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian society. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman relevance but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria until after Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries and he can feel according to their own statement by people who have to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, the Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he didn't open it openly against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded from the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in conscience to do anything in the second generation - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan, and never before it was never in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions so," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man, while he shaken at water Nesma in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise until sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanian law also act that the public intake of food during the Ramadan illegal is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensory hot young boy with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the mustles are warm coffee and the weakens of the Kent cigarette in the nose, first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes, Jordan is like a prison under the open sky above all, if one throws a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is avoided it easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan Water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the State of Jordaniens has made a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary members, who support the Islamic Aktiv Front - argued that the sexual orientation of homosexuals Frontbeers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many in addition, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arabian spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism, which represents the altproven legitimacy of authoritarian regintimacy in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement by Mashrou'Leila the jordan people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which is still decided to employ a intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be probably not simply seized rhetoric, but actually a more clearly demonstrating crystallization reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in Hdaibs plant."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional Sexchternormen by suffering, moving his vision of the fate of the Arab women who have cited sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently Dutch-made woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through hands, which they actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'honorary morrode' was arrested - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch won the number of Honorary morde in 2016 their peak; however, it still occurs, that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who have sacrificed victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for the breasts of the year 1954 women, which are exposed to a certain time in prison, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee of the family needed, that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music is delighted with great popularity and is known for it, also not before subjects to retreat that in his country as taboo gold."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib contests that his work is politically, however, that he is his music, the full of explicitres on sexuality, freedom and expression is not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he was heard politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" and "" Ghareeb "" lies the focus again on poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeatedly repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and each other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want" - be it belief or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian people and that comments on Equality between LGBTQ + -Individuals have been strongly increased until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, to remember that his comments has been torn out of the context, and in his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a registered version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib open to the Arab LGBT + -Community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexual did not give Islam to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in mind thanks to his homogeneous poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib ask yourself: if Abu Nuwhat was going to work later on behalf of the calibre, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing was said with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In Hashemitic Kingdom it is nothing new that the government's attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought into silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanian messenger service has firmly rooted several former government members and members of the teacher, with the grounds, they have had attributed to the problems in social media that merged with the deep in the land."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert Hdaibs, which is only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous gene and taking. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now sees a performance in a row, but the way of progress - so it is Hdaib - consists of slow, bedtime and internally change. he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not only dreams his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"maybe the region will approach the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness, and not by bombs, aspiration and on artificial kind of democracies. at least hopes he."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is far, Hdaib will continue to be resin and therefore also resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only lovemaking to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel extinct, affection opposite?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth-Stiftung Not more out of the head and inspected them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) to write young people to write guerillers.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only in short, her country was setting part of a historical event and she wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Guerillabewater FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Former), which forms the battles of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International is the underlying of the peace of peace be as significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos for his services received the peace-prize prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian, however, is still a long way to see from real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakamper that lived for many years in illegal camps that were exposed to a war heterogenealogy and integrate their weapons coming into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla, they must take them into their ranks and support them when building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian will close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly this they did: until now they have written thousands of young people letters - lovings to former Guerillakampers to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerillers - which should then be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World summit of Peace Prize Prize, which took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there had Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the peace of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"stated that we love the people who we love, am Valentine's thousands of lovemaking, but those forgotten it much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, told it further to share in this year his love with people who needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan, letters was full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, which now have to build their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a united history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, within the framework of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumba as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I never had thought, that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo raised by the Foundation BogotArt in the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">Members of the FARC set themselves as it had done earlier to accept the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not received a commandment, but letters of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything, what was in between, and told the policy of Jimenz Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra is a employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca. this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, led me a former fighters through the camp of Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, where the guerilla live) saw, I saw a Guerillakamper that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him was a MGL granting, a fatal weapon in the Dornthenia worm."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said him to and asked him," hello, what do they do? "he answered:" "I said to a letter that anyone has written someone."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, so I answered him. as he suddenly answered me the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I watched him very firm and set me next to the granules.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was sorry for the war, it was sorry, all the years of faithful companion to be this fighters and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. I have never thought him and his six brethren before famine. I had never thought that someone would forgive me to my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society where it is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now I learned only, as I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as war and the FARC already remained in concealment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the leaders of the FARC, the leaders of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views beyond the peace process:" "many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to a political party in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people heard that so far had never found hearing and no choices had seen, and even believed that people have often seen as monster and even hate, even people have been sealed by their habitat and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"reality, in which the country lives, does me sore me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all humans - also, who have killed and so much damage caused to bring us something and can give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered on the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote to DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was made that after the drafing peace would be glorified.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that's also totally justified."</seg>
<seg id="2234">We stand by the FARC now on peace, on a policy without arms. "</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defender of peace on - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belonged - to rise above all that of a country in the war."</seg>

<seg id="2285">I have a body size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>

<seg id="2313">OC Media: stand with your family or in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, about the gender equality, we are not talking, this is a tabular topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still trace in me.</seg>

<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays are even less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they may do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine, which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been argued since the 1980s in the United States of Salat.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant, cultivated by NASA-astronaut in the space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">Nearly 20 years of Mortons was only performed by his own inventiveness and the question how many salatoms can get boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he pointed out that more salads were patented and that he could not use it further on the breweries.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patente are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or gregate or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more such patents have been registered in more plants like cereals or cartridge varieties. due to this trend ensure the plant breeders, environmental protection and experts for nutrition security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia ancient tradition feared Morton still salad, he has now needs no longer, because his work is always worth more and more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when would lie in a river a rock."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must do this now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition." "I think that these patents on salads are too far away."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand before judgment, no longer a new salad breeders, because all features are already patented, so it's as good as possible and tried to see those characteristics, which he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is however very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source. ("open source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name is rather like this name looks like the movement out of the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" -Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software and provides the alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched to life, to ensure that some plant species and gene is not protected as a intellectual property and thus be permanently available for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, the US breeders can commit themselves that others can be used by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to make business with their seed, and they can use it." open source "" breeders merely permit others to breed their own varieties, and it is not immediately utilized - two aspects that banned by many plant patente. "</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozen breeder and seeds have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Membersmember of Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seeds plays a role in larger compositions such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutritional system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only little by using seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented whether fruits, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or mongto and Bayer are announced that in August or September 2016, it should know that the way for example, it should know how this vegetable is reared, threatened, is threatened."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters arguing that the future of food supplies is endangered, since the available compool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights to plant material that is thus always available to shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Embassists in Ossi, has been associated with genetic variation at carrots and availability. they found out that about one third of all Kartottensions as intellectual property is protected by allowing it to be used for plant breeders either at all or only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates yet not, but experts like Luby vermbers that massaculate plants as wheat in even greater style are patented as salad or carottos."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so geared to prove it targeted features - from such a person through which their tastes or their color improves up to those who are treated in certain environments and threats such as pests or disease.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponent of patents on plant qualities point out that the available plant material for breeder is currently taking more patents than ever before since the changing conditions are much worse predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail recognize Monsanto-SprecherIn Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity are generally important and also decisive for monsantos activities. with a total of four genes and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural sector of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it is reflected in the view that intellectual property forms other breeders, since" patents and protection of plant variation innovations. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that can be followed, once the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions will help others to come with another method for the same outcome."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection inhibits therefore innovations not, but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait, until a patent of baptism, is certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for such a long time, to brewered to plants that are adapted to the altered environmental conditions, the fight would have already lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main plant for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and still remain in:" "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will not be impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is disturbing to patron in a total concept:" "we create the characteristics not really itself."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants alike form them out and as breeder we ultimately have no idea as the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-Board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who has been a variety of plant breeding, chats her own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monoultures, for their cultivation of herbicide needed, the breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that remain on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are) patents without to survive the most smaller saunas, even without patents, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding-garden salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders through the prevention of plant patented innovative would:" "it looks like me, when I think with my efforts, new to produce more than businesses that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog as I know that my competitors are selling for my varieties in a few years ago," he says. "" with a patent it is protected 20 years ahead of competition, what one makes it really beautiful. "worldwide resonance"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be in the" open source "" breeding leader, the concept stretches now rapidly over the world. "</seg>

<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still confined to the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time I met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend around 05 August the Egyptian Government has documented the website of Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world."</seg>

<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Surge - despite this attack, and the constitution by the authorities should defend and pursue a voice in this part of the world, so it was never as difficult as now. ANHRI have never been so difficult to overcome the locking and not admit. we persisted to continue our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first disadvantageous website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocking the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking issue of Huffington Post and that from Qatar-mende network of Al Jazeera" to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, while he took over the student protests as well as the police physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Its article relate mainly for politics and human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada is expressed by the government and reflecting what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the, blogs to sperren is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded to give me the feeling of an insect to give me the feeling of a direct murder; an inheritance to the national security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I have not written. in other words: my words have influence even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles in order to deal with the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The pocious walk the way to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally be merged, that the condition decisions are made behind closed doors, which the Egyptian population has no legal basis to help prevent the trial against these actions."</seg>
