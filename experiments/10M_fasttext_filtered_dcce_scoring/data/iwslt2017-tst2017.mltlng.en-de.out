this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won as New York Times @-@ Rep@@ or@@ ter the Pul@@ it@@ zer Prize .
&quot; long before each one had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the NS@@ A illegal teleph@@ ones have heard from Americans . &quot;
&quot; but it is another chapter , which should be left a lasting impression . &quot;
ther@@ ein he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US @-@ intelligence cooperation in which the CIA was liter@@ ally dr@@ unk for an atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
&quot; but do you know , whom the chapters at all did not fell ? &quot;
the U.S. government .
almost 10 years the government has been established against Ris@@ en and calls him to call his appropriate sources .
&quot; in this train it became a symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers to condem@@ n and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Con@@ stitu@@ tional Con@@ stitu@@ tional , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at Ris@@ en ank@@ ees , he did something that many m@@ ighty repor@@ ter already did before him : he wei@@ ger@@ ed himself and said that he would rather go to the prison . &quot;
&quot; so from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en , therefore lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; then , only days before the process , passive something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though she was imper@@ ative for her case , the claims of the government were dropped to cr@@ acks . &quot;
the reason : in the time electronic monitoring the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide less .
instead of fail and cr@@ y to bring statements to the statements , that also could do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so have the medi@@ ators , without His consent , his telephone at home , &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank@@ notes , his credit card , and even matur@@ ities with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they are used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers and risk . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised at his trial , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condem@@ ned more than any US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government can become much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers to a journ@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first Con@@ stitu@@ tional Con@@ stitu@@ tional Treaty , because the government has always more possibilities to do all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government permits , the rights of re@@ actors to handle , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed they can record them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the afternoon , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been written as Ris@@ en his book , and it is much saf@@ er than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers which was originally developed by the internet &apos;s most famous , developed by us and has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , when I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a messages website , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server , which only has access the respective news agency . &quot;
&quot; so , the government cannot compl@@ ain the government anymore , and many of the information that would be request , would not be available from advance . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world develop new Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ et@@ echn@@ ologies that are all endanger@@ ed us . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ den@@ omin@@ ator as Edward Snow@@ den have one way , disp@@ utes have to be mis@@ understood . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers . &quot;
&quot; the talk about abuse at the care of soldiers , who wants to tell . or the next environmental colle@@ ague will be reporting . or the next environmental colle@@ ague , the alarm on se@@ pul@@ ated water of F@@ lin@@ t sugge@@ sts . or a pilgri@@ street turn , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our of all constitu@@ tional rights . &quot;
&quot; thanks , &quot;
&#91; on 3 . April 2016 the biggest data b@@ acon of history was published . &#93; &#91; which means that ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; this week we were taken by news about a l@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and Law@@ yers to companies such as Mos@@ quit@@ os Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ ity enterprise . can you set it up ? &quot;
&quot; we are actually seeing the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister is rej@@ ected .
also there are reports that a allies of the brut@@ al Sy@@ rian dict@@ ator of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s wall@@ ets in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin takes over a close friend of children &apos;s , one famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be there a lot of rich people and others , the nervous on the next release , and on the next enth@@ r@@ amm@@ ed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ Romans .
&quot; it seems to be we@@ pt from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tell us what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful being able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide their assets and to wear it -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and dis@@ covers . &quot;
&quot; I think many people all the world will be very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I am always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , in another company what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind these pra@@ yers . &quot;
&quot; it may be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; probably because there were not a prominent Americans who had previously announced in these re@@ vel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; well , it is not so that there is no we@@ alth@@ y Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ quit@@ os Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to have connections into the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need to specify less information in some US states , less information needs to create a company as to get a bibli@@ ography . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed to complete the employees of school@@ children to prevent school@@ children .
it has sc@@ amm@@ ers allowed to gr@@ asp most vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this sees in practice .
how does this actually work ?
&quot; thus , we sent a direct invent@@ ory to the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ fir@@ es in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our invent@@ or gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring sus@@ pic@@ ious money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really sho@@ cked it really that all until having a lawyer of our medi@@ ator proposals made how he could generate his money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ cau@@ tionary . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course , nobody was passed on to the money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a single case .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which has under@@ gone our promised proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single top @-@ political , hidden in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior .
&quot; it may sound all very tr@@ endy , as if we could do anything against it ; as if nothing ever had changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as an attractive optimization , I really see that things have to change . &quot;
over the last few years we have seen suggestions for more transparency and the owners of companies concerned .
the topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is cap@@ tured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill introduced into both parliament@@ arians , but this makes no progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means used to ensure more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are an@@ gry , if they see how others can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; we need ex@@ ecu@@ tives in the economy , which stand and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and emplo@@ y it , through laws this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally put the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kid@@ n@@ apped once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; a day , after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ stage . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ ow@@ da remained and looked up my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made a trip through all the land . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I lu@@ d him on a beer . he told me what he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the error to ask him : &quot; where to f@@ ought you for today night ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , Mann ! &quot;
what do I do now ?
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I didn &apos;t know him just ! he says that he would go to the peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to end in the trunk area of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk @-@ trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a bub@@ bles . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was in bed , I star@@ r@@ alled to the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I find out there ? &quot;
a wilderness in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , on Flip @-@ tips for the door , and my sle@@ eps . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought by me today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as the host . it has changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who have been sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends , which just wa@@ ited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with . &quot;
&quot; we make a newspaper , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost pl@@ ei@@ te , my fellow inhabitants are drawn and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can do it , anxiety in fun to turn . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I got about how we could earn something . our apartment is staying in a designer @-@ bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
&quot; Hi , &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ nb &#93; .
three happ@@ ier guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood@@ winds .
they found it super and we also found .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese sh@@ ines dis@@ tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we were touring with them through the whole city . when we got our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ r@@ ten Brian and I am . &quot;
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mates , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether one could make of it a business concept .
&quot; we would like to send us the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website , on the people , public photos of their private spaces , their bathrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind rooms whose doors can be over . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can then invite you to invite people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the rock@@ et would be mis@@ sed .
but in fact they do not .
&quot; no one who is still in Tro@@ st , would invest in a business , for@@ eig@@ ners allowed to sleep in the apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that for@@ eig@@ ners are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one encounter@@ ed the things that one can be good . we could des@@ per@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create through design immense trust , between people who had never met . &quot;
can design so something ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a costume , which degree of confidence we strive . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experim@@ ent . it will force you out of your com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I like to like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock with your left seat cushi@@ ons .
&quot; this quiet@@ ly flight from panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel , if they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing is more personal than your phone is , your home is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel that un@@ lock the phone of a stran@@ ger in the hands ?
most are the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they sleep in .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only times like who has actually Al Gor@@ es Phone ?
could you pro@@ claim on Twitter that he set up for the office of the president ?
you can now return the phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail to this experim@@ ent ?
&quot; what if your neigh@@ bour were imag@@ ined once upon his name : if he would have told , where he comes to his dog or his children ? &quot;
imagine they would have 150 sites that all say : &quot; he can really be very well un@@ locking phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you would have to cancel your phone ?
because a well @-@ driven feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
&quot; it was hard for the people , negative app@@ rais@@ al . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their arrangements before we set it online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we under@@ stands that people trust each other , depending on how much they are with regard to age and place . &quot;
&quot; little surpris@@ ingly we trust the people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social inci@@ dence .
exciting it is when you add the call of a person -- in our case thanks to Be@@ ur@@ departments .
&quot; if one has less than three assess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of simil@@ arities .
&quot; so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply root@@ ed preferences . &quot;
&quot; moreover , we drove that confidence depends on how much you are there . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a host .
&quot; if one tells too little , like for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; , you do not get any answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell a lot , like for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the inquiry will not be accepted rather . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Great artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to manufacture this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which themes you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
&quot; what we had not counted , the great amount of people who were more than willing to set these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people will take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , : incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third : a need , the previously was not covered . &quot;
for us the business is very good .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything goes smooth@@ ly . &quot;
there were guests who are un@@ permitted parties or have been wo@@ und@@ ed apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls were directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front Front if trust was broken .
there is nothing Sch@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than this calls . it does not do so if I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that one heard in the voice of an@@ ru@@ de , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , from the 123 million sold overnight stays only a fr@@ action of one problem ever . &quot;
for people confidential one another .
when trust is working there can be a mir@@ acle .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there is a heart attack .
his hosts took him into hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to lean on the basis of se@@ ven@@ ous activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protective engel which save a life , even though they do not know . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want , that one feels lon@@ ely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course does not run any stay .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
&quot; when I asked for the first time about this concept , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money actions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; rent &quot; &quot; to call , the thing is not fair . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trading , human relationships promises . &quot;
people lay a part of itself open and that changes everything .
&quot; if you see nowadays , this is with fast food to compare . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be , if at every place you visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly complete and one in a pub our area , one of which one has never heard before . &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would be able to share apartments from reason to compassion ?
how would this look like ?
what would be if the thoughts have taken the thoughts of shared shared ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and dis@@ sem@@ ination .
in Southern Cor@@ eas Capital Seoul this project has already begun . many parking places that the government belong@@ ed to
have now been offered here . students who were looking for a pen@@ cils
were started to people who were educ@@ ated to their children . they were started in@@ cub@@ ator programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . beyond our platform , night 785 ,000 people will be guests in 191 countries guest at a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned .
in front of us there were similar websites .
so why has our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we find that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome low @-@ quality pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ;
straight @-@ overwhel@@ ming .
I have to think of every time when a rot@@ er Maz@@ da goes to me .
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but when it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself , what we can use design soon . &quot;
&quot; thanks , &quot;
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ inde@@ er , a terror@@ ist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security che@@ que at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so the media people represent , which look like me . &quot;
a study conducted that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans mean , most would do not know Muslims . &quot;
&quot; probably , people do not speak with their users . &quot;
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great , you know . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
&quot; Fuj@@ itsu , not@@ ebooks &quot;
&quot; and I am an practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ched me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ osexu@@ ality person , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head @-@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friendship were released : &quot; &quot; why supp@@ ressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ atia was : at that time , it was for me a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and indeed with the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds to adapt me to a perfect and Un@@ touch@@ able beauty . &quot;
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I made with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked in question , beyond and believ@@ ed finally . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the cor@@ k .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to the wol@@ ves .
I am concerned myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone you percei@@ ve , you completely understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
so it feels like .
&quot; later married I and began , like all good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engine@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had an end @-@ breakfast , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ gen from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock absor@@ bed quickly in sens@@ ory .
why should you do something like something ?
&quot; I joined the television and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terr@@ ori@@ sts &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam , ... , ... &quot; &quot; on@@ ast@@ ed descent ... , ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bard@@ ed M@@ ek@@ ka ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked my land , but in the N@@ U , the acts of others led by a civil war into a sus@@ pic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to start into a new city and start with the start @-@ up studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I drove back -- so deeply moved to my seat , and I was going to be recognized for the first time as Muslim . &quot;
we moved to our apartment in our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then I heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations which bes@@ ought : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; pen@@ ises in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; Vers@@ am@@ mm@@ elt not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then Friday was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for the pra@@ yers .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filter@@ ed and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people , which one held for Muslims , to the Free z@@ err@@ te and clever . &quot;
there was really fire charges in mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because people who have attacked the country , our country had attacked . &quot;
I used the anger of people on the terr@@ ori@@ sts .
imagine ! I was also an@@ gry .
it is not easy to explain themselves and@@ ern@@ ing itself .
I have nothing to ask questions I love questions .
it is the exc@@ uses that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as well as of a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we b@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or is as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or can only be under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the U.S. , but an essential organ . &quot;
&quot; regards , &quot;
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America more secure ?
&quot; it will perhaps be released a few parking spaces , but not the ter@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to view people with other faith , and greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as I was a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually radi@@ c@@ alised . &quot;
they are radi@@ c@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ c@@ alization process you noticed that it goes online . as the first the person is cut off from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes the terr@@ ori@@ sts are the true Muslims , and everyone who agree to their behaviour and their ideology , is a tra@@ it@@ or or faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alization , we must keep people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still asser@@ ted that Islam is a non@@ viol@@ ent religion .
&quot; finally , a group as the IS set up its brut@@ ality with the basket . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to her imagination , if you ack@@ no@@ wledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion belie@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; regards , &quot;
the IS has to do so much with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you thro@@ wing a look at it , it does not drive what they do in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture &quot; &quot; LA@@ S@@ EN . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding I@@ mam tell me recently an aston@@ ishing story :
a girl came to him because they would have done to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radi@@ c@@ ale religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom they had spoken , and said their wr@@ ath , her sense for inj@@ ustice in the world , they would only bring into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; of nothing inspired and something that had given their che@@ ut sense , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam introduced the connection to God and their church .
&quot; instead of hum@@ ble for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they left them to join the IS . &quot;
that was a look like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour expression of fear every day to our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear for at least three things happen .
we are accep@@ ting a autor@@ it@@ ary government system that con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; a study shows : if one encounter@@ s a test messages , in which negative about Muslims reported , they were rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an academ@@ ical problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims came up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks .
it happened in the pro@@ field of Iraq war and during two leg@@ acies .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem ter@@ ror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulation of the public to explo@@ it the foundation of a free society , the r@@ ational and good inform@@ ational citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ mark .
we maybe feel it as the first but the tox@@ ic air of fear pro@@ ves to all .
&quot; with the assignment of collective bl@@ ame , it does not only need to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , living in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ letes .
&quot; he was at the dental Fac@@ ulty , tal@@ ented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the leg@@ est , generous person that she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is from my fr@@ amed of such a se@@ aled young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in their apartment , as with an execution , after he post@@ pon@@ ed against Muslims on his facebook page . &quot;
he sh@@ oss eight times in De@@ ah .
&quot; Fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also de@@ adly . &quot;
&quot; so , back to the beginning . &quot;
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mos@@ que or stayed at home ?
&quot; we wor@@ r@@ ate it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America would be ex@@ emp@@ t to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one that we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the Kinder@@ station we drove to be silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , dre@@ w my shoes , went into the command@@ ing , and what I saw , let me keep . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam arose , and called our guests welcome , because half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , belie@@ vers and non @-@ belie@@ vers who have come to us , but to help us . &quot;
in this moment I am broken .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on the number safe ?
or you will close to those who are my : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have a ner@@ ve .
&quot; but I ask myself , what you say that you might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought @-@ in with dr@@ au@@ ght , so , an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; DAL@@ IA Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dec@@ ei@@ ve not . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my history is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever accomplished study on all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I do not have an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception to rule , then often the rule have been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : many thanks . DAL@@ IA Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for craf@@ ting began , just before that , a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ shop is too . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ packages in our social consciousness , has built a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in FR@@ AC Centre in France and built a six meters high tower from 1 500 brick . a few years ago they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
by joining aircraft with high speed and acceler@@ ation on a small space .
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
they have learned to bear the loads to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ence and generally respond to nature legislation .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exc@@ eed the limits of possible in the autonom@@ ous flight .
&quot; thus a system aut@@ on@@ oun work , it has to know coll@@ ectively , where the mobile objects have to be found . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the swi@@ ft development of dynam@@ ically Tas@@ ks . &quot;
for today &apos;s dem@@ os we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a samp@@ ling of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
every plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to define calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands is available at the highest pol@@ e. such as &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so@@ c@@ ult blade , &quot;
&quot; a plane , which tries , two flying with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other tri@@ bes , it is efficient in the up@@ ward trip efficient , much more efficient than hel@@ icopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most bottles , it can weak@@ ly , and therefore has great advantages for start and land@@ ing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restri@@ ction of h@@ edge is that they are sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ence such as windsurfing .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter how the optimal position can be recover@@ ed and the performance can be improved by exercise .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce fundamental abstract questions , which propos@@ es to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icopter are known about as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts that work together to hur@@ t you .
&quot; before decades , educ@@ ated pil@@ ots @-@ controlled aircraft were flying , which only two mov@@ able parts had : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ edge ru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; un@@ far , we discovered that lie with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ o@@ sp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est distance , it was inv@@ ented before short . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , h@@ inge and cross@@ linking , no further actu@@ ators or cont@@ rol@@ lo@@ ber@@ surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simp@@ le@@ ver is happening in the interior so much , so that it can fly in space and can move away in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ edge . to bring it to catch , I must take it right . &quot;
&quot; the prob@@ ability to throw it right , if all watch , is low , that is why I show you a video that was film@@ ed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ o@@ sp@@ inner is a exercise in com@@ mu@@ y , this machine is here , the Om@@ bud@@ sman with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ern , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all of this super@@ flow ?
they see that he is very symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , he will receive the extraordinary ability , &quot;
move in space in all directions no matter in which direction he is film@@ ed or even as he rot@@ ated .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest is experienced directly when flying . &quot;
let us see this .
&quot; when air@@ crafts should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers aircraft .
this is on the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance squ@@ ares . &quot;
&quot; however something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or cor@@ dless -- can fly the machine as well . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we make a half excursion .
the last demonstration examined syn@@ thetic vibr@@ ations .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , coordinated units allows a range of aes@@ thetic expression . &quot;
we took the usual micro @-@ squ@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weigh@@ s less than a disk bread -- and made them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully they motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine does not want to practice in Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types of us lies the re@@ ward in the development and the avi@@ ation .
&quot; it serves as a memory of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it &apos;s creative , sound cre@@ atures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential , is the icing on the i . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; a very far distant gal@@ axy two black holes in a very far distant gal@@ axy , two black holes are getting faster , you turned so the mass of three sun@@ sets in a t@@ enth of pure energy . &quot;
this short moment long sh@@ ining them bright@@ er than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole us known universe .
it was a very big bang .
but your energy put it out in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time feelings themselves and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we will arrange the events at first time .
1,@@ 3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ piece life on earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has seen some : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stru@@ ck us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group especially cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from M@@ IT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ Tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for engra@@ ving black holes . &quot;
most of them kept it for crazy .
&quot; but enough people called them as crazy gen@@ ius , so that the US National Science Foundation is their idea to finance their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much h@@ arter work , they built the det@@ ector of LI@@ GO : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could considerably increase the precision of LI@@ GO performance . &quot;
therefore one call him now Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO has started to clari@@ fy some minor , stu@@ b@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vity of the two col@@ li@@ ate black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emoti@@ onal than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my to@@ d@@ kran@@ ken father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that I had worked , is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tical physi@@ c@@ ist of black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ ories like LI@@ GO brass signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational emp@@ ower ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation shaft is a cr@@ ash in the feeling of space and time .
when moving the shaft will be the space and its full content is stret@@ ched in one direction and into the other .
&quot; to the illustration , lect@@ ur@@ ers in courses for the Rel@@ ativity scene often have a right al@@ ber@@ ate dance . &quot;
&quot; stret@@ ching and du@@ ps , stret@@ ching and du@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stret@@ ched from us at the adv@@ ent of the waves and gest@@ ure . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is called 20 Nul@@ len according to the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1 Dar@@ by explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already ab@@ sur@@ d , the length would have to be measured less than a thousand of the radius of a nuclear power . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ c@@ ist are in@@ ventions , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : faces , the size of your hand . &quot;
this is quite handy . because then you can create a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of the light around you .
with ton@@ es that is different .
&quot; hearing sh@@ ades have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters . &quot;
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to manufacture an image of things that will mean a lot of things : &quot;
the face of your child is about .
&quot; instead , we are based on certain characteristics such as Ton@@ er and height , rhythm and volume , to close to the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , it is said Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob underground them . &quot;
&quot; number , Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vity .
we can not produce easy pictures of objects in the All .
&quot; but by moving on changes in the amp@@ lit@@ ude and frequency of waves , we can hear her stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we transform the pattern in Sch@@ all , we can hear the All liter@@ ally speak . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to loud , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , what my colle@@ ague Scott has already been busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rot@@ ating holes , cir@@ cuits simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional tone @-@ change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement that shaped into the wav@@ el@@ ength .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that should never be forgotten -- heard of LI@@ GO follow : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der@@ sound &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what he must hear this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun@@ sets , which are about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : we put in short what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , around one hundred times per second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
ther@@ ein lies the meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a completely new way to expl@@ oration of the age as it was never before .
on this way we can hear the All accor@@ d and the invisible .
much in space we can see -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned much about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and sil@@ icon hidden . &quot;
we will never see h@@ ind@@ le as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation w@@ ast@@ ate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ water : I would never resear@@ ched the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the Ur@@ kn@@ all is covered by his own neigh@@ bour . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ation , it should be possible to return until the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and that is the most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and from which we do not have any idea . things that we just discover what we listen . &quot;
in fact LI@@ GO was in the first sight of things we did not expect .
&quot; my colle@@ ague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , like LI@@ GO it observed , the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ur@@ old bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so important the su@@ cking b@@ ones for our arch@@ e@@ ological work . &quot;
LI@@ GO makes us an entirely different point of view to the events in the All , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on it as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and the cater@@ pillars of the co@@ smo@@ s .
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in All .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful , than the Ur@@ ash@@ all itself ? &quot;
now is time of great dreams .
dream with us .
&quot; thanks , &quot;
for some time I tried an experim@@ ent .
&quot; a year long , I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; say , before I fear me . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I for@@ give me &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to begin with the spect@@ acle ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I fear , and I fear my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , re@@ holding , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a particular yes , that my life deeply changed , on an un@@ expected article . it started with a question of my inf@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; I have three unbeliev@@ able daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and Em@@ erson , the p@@ etty , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; emotion &quot; &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; emotion , I need milk for my Schn@@ abel@@ t@@ asse . &quot;
she asked them once I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude in my family . from there I sent me to play with them as soon as you do . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I loved me very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magic effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a b@@ lossom @-@ effect : only before short , I was completely mis@@ sed that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ages to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream@@ job .
I am author . I think things that awak@@ ens you to life .
dream@@ job .
&quot; Hi , &quot;
I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I create television . I created television .
&quot; I make television , in a large style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for that 70 hours in the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four Shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
&quot; every shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for a episode of a television program can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , at the same time in production , times four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television classes will run on Thurs@@ days at the Thurs@@ days of Thurs@@ days .
my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ on . I have to find time , really sti@@ ff@@ ed , creative time to gather my fans for camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who this still makes ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a tit@@ led . &quot;
dream@@ job .
I would like to im@@ print you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you all of you who want to work so hard , whether you want to take a company , a country or a household , so that you understand that I don &apos;t just say on the computer and I understand that I don &apos;t understand it in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , everything work , all the blood , all blood , all swe@@ at -- not te@@ ars . &quot;
I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
if I am deeper into my work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on , when I called on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as dre@@ ad@@ le a high tone , is a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is cre@@ atively , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic , funny and mis@@ i@@ ously , cru@@ el and reasonable , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well runs .
&quot; a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s hear like a busy road , I could go for ever on it . &quot;
many people take them when I put them the sw@@ amp that I was over@@ s writing speech that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong that does it do .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production as I began to work and work , to create , create , create , to create , to create , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can not stretch out differently from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , no different to be stret@@ ched as according to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ a@@ holi@@ c .
perhaps it is called Genie .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I do not know it .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not afraid of failure , and I just know that I love the sw@@ men . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I do not want it to ask . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work , the more work there , the more things more , the more watch me , more sup@@ pose I have history , so more expectations are there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more needs to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
I love labour , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I made , the Mar@@ athon , the army , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then stops the sum@@ s .
&quot; revised , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated . &quot;
the sum@@ s st@@ alls .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single employee . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Em@@ erson says : &quot; emotion , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
there are children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ titles .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , as the sum@@ s . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine hide .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , made weekends , no re@@ ue not , is not on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a lecture tit@@ led tit@@ anium .
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so what makes you doing , if what you do , the work that one loves , suddenly ver@@ latable ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; hy@@ l you aus , foo@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you are doing it , one thinks that you are doing what you do , a ban@@ ker , one painter , Bill G@@ ates , one wants to know one another , and knows how to be the sum@@ s , if you &apos;re the sum@@ s already knew , if the sum@@ s stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart , I can survive in the silence ? &quot;
and then me my &quot; south @-@ states Kell@@ ner into &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way home , late dr@@ an and she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things are aware : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and second@@ ly , she called me not &quot; emotion . &quot;
it is called anyone more &quot; emotion . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I for@@ got it , when I am Titan and my sum@@ s pra@@ ying , and here everything is changing my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and off their sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the lack of the tot@@ ame , I can do nothing , except . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quiet@@ ly .
&quot; the country , which I er@@ re , the Mar@@ athon , which I dis@@ continued , the army , the high tone - they no longer exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is glu@@ ed fing@@ ers and moisture kis@@ ses , delic@@ ate voices , vig@@ orous things , or the song in which it is s@@ qui@@ ver , or whatever the girl is in &quot; &quot; ice cream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy market comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly hear , but it is there . &quot;
not the sum@@ s but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I would know a magic secret .
but let us remain at the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the labour sum@@ s , the Titan@@ ic , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you , who you are , if I say to you , who I am , when I describe my brain , and how functional my brain is , then I forget what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the current one of the lives of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true sum@@ s ign@@ ores the pressure of the story that expect@@ ation and the pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; true sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps dar@@ ing to me God the wrong words , because what God said me that I am a Titan am ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child want to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I have been doing this rule so that I can free myself as a Work@@ a@@ holi@@ c of any fault .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice but if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I like it . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to play in such a way , as work . &quot;
the truth is doing so far .
but I do not like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work as home .
this entry is pain@@ ful because what a person is working rather than home ?
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; time honest , I n@@ enne myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we sh@@ ave in the garden around , before and back , and back . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ red@@ ded soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so I feel pre@@ domin@@ antly , ab@@ ide and conf@@ used . &quot;
I always g@@ uns according to my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how one lives , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfilled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also ! say it always ! Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a post@@ pon@@ y . &quot;
&quot; there you are probably right , but you can also do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they would like to make something else . &quot;
there are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I replaced me a vision of Lady@@ bug or bis@@ eks .
&quot; and after my te@@ y daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes in the piece , even at a to@@ ken @-@ La@@ une day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ version . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children and finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes away are in !
&quot; my children are my char@@ ity , my world . it does not have to feel the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul @-@ peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about joy .
to play the &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I vict@@ ories . friends meet , books read , read the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you play ? &quot; is short for everything I received , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes in the piece , why not full 15 minutes walk ? &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I do not work .
works not without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens onto the energy and I find myself in my office . I heard me to new ideas . the sum@@ s has returned to new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ eds and love my work . &quot;
I like the sum@@ s but I love it not .
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more . &quot;
soap and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me schn@@ apps that I am a Titan am . I have never seen a Titan Poker , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to play more play .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my stock will burn .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better working I . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , the Mar@@ athon , which I dis@@ close the troops , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sw@@ men of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , beb@@ id@@ ly , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things that I aw@@ aken you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream@@ job should be a little dre@@ umer@@ able .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more play .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ edi@@ es .
&quot; I know how your life may change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ logical , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , a very low capacity to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on ?
a doctor who tried to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; sure they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; deep underground stimulation . &quot; it impl@@ anted an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the cir@@ cuits of neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function improved . &quot;
it really is an aston@@ ishing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered under f@@ atigue and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ logical is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was con@@ duc@@ tive val@@ ent@@ ine and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I often vers@@ ed patients with Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trauma .
they must imagine that in Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain @-@ schw@@ ill@@ i and the sh@@ red@@ ded pressure .
to save life you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; for this , one has to sometimes remove a part of a g@@ ok@@ er brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of the en@@ cap@@ ed shepherd , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , to analyze the brain . &quot;
what my I mean by it ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells from a tissue to grow , is comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to let them thri@@ ve . &quot;
exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many verses it was Jean @-@ François .
he looked under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology , that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells may be turned into each cell type of the organis@@ m . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain @-@ cre@@ ature in the OP are preserved .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells were different .
they are slowly moving slowly and after a couple of weeks it even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but it was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our large @-@ hir@@ ing cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the control of the brain .
but why stay they get to us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain . &quot;
this we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of bra@@ zz@@ ling out of the non @-@ speaking part , and then the cells just so cultiv@@ ated as it Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they then mark@@ edly mark@@ ings to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we travel@@ ed them at the ab@@ err@@ ation of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ ation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we drive these cells into normal brain @-@ web@@ s ? and what will happen if we have the same cells in commercial brain ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we travel@@ ed the cells into a health@@ ier brain , and we wat@@ ched that they had gone back after some weeks , they go back home . the space is already occupied , so they will not go there . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation of and travel@@ ed exactly the same cells and now stayed the cells -- they wash@@ ed to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were travel@@ ed .
&quot; proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also to recover from a brain injury ?
so we practi@@ se monkeys with a manual proj@@ ection .
they had to take feed pell@@ ets from a tray .
they made it very well .
&quot; as they reached a stable skill level , we have reached the mot@@ oric Cor@@ tex the Hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k area . &quot;
&quot; then , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recover@@ ed spont@@ aneously to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plas@@ ma brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as if the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , so we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey w@@ ishing to recover@@ ed spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from violation .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we travel@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rich plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use it entries and later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream still is to im@@ aging them in people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain , there is a means to cure yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gius@@ san@@ i : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in man . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill about two kil@@ o@@ grams papers and forms forms to pass this kind of studies . &quot;
BG : this is understand@@ able the brain is very Del@@ ikat etc .
&quot; j@@ b : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years will take it to anyone can come into hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
j@@ b : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the admission of clinical study . &quot;
will we allow ourselves the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then one has to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must really refer to first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . j@@ b : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as a invent@@ ory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changing contr@@ acting .
we believe that capitalism is imper@@ ative to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great neigh@@ b@@ ors in Beijing have two viol@@ ent freely that it is possible to have a flo@@ wering capitalism and impressive growth while the politics fully und@@ em@@ ocratic .
&quot; indeed , democracy in us is in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the au@@ ster@@ ity programmes that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could well be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my inf@@ latable friends that would be repeated , if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe in together with me , again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group we could save democracy , but that we could need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies will be painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies used . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threat@@ ened our taver@@ n . &quot;
I n@@ enne it the &quot; tw@@ ins @-@ apples @-@ par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but only a few recogni@@ zing its Z@@ W@@ IL@@ L@@ ING .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ fortun@@ ate cash , which belongs to an@@ x@@ ious as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , which might be too an@@ x@@ ious , where it would be productive and income , with whom you bear the school@@ berg b@@ illing and also all things could produce that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I n@@ enne them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months in the USA , in England and in the euro area , 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars invested in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , schools , office buildings , schools , streets , par@@ se , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , which compar@@ es at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital the tw@@ ins apples which are not affected by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which could not invest in which they could not invest in which she would not consider that his son will kill him when he will grow , &quot;
non @-@ viol@@ ates the circumstances that lead that oil @-@ pus him k@@ ills him .
that is my h@@ ad@@ ern with capitalism --
&quot; his exc@@ ess imp@@ lies all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , human tal@@ ents and especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are crucial to save the Earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue ; what do we understand by democracy ?
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , in the open air and the poor as a majority of the government control . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy is naturally too many of --
&quot; women , for@@ eig@@ ners , and of course sl@@ aves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these ex@@ emp@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they have made the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they shall have the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood in questions of the state . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy does not have kept long --
&quot; like a cand@@ le , which is very light sh@@ ines , it is also quick @-@ burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal bourgeoisie did not have its roots in the ancient Athens ; &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glori@@ ous revolution of 1688 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; because the liberal democracy came first , as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process was established on politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone was established . &quot;
&quot; in our present dem@@ ocr@@ acies since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began to under@@ take an un@@ even struggle between the two by doing the economy gradually and they ent@@ ails . &quot;
wonder why the politicians are no longer than before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is that one can now be in the government and nevertheless , not in power because power from politics to the economy is separated and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my h@@ ad@@ ors with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is in about such as a herd of rob@@ bers , which is so lasting the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ed that they are at the end of this reason . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far kan@@ ni@@ b@@ alised , that it grows by the independent economic crisis itself . the power of the business grows , political goods are increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too fri@@ ght@@ ened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the successful capitalism the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins will be the tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obviously that we have to bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of sl@@ aves , women and for@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Left had already had this idea for 100 years ago and it was not very strange .
the doc@@ trine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be re@@ treat that the working arms can only reg@@ ain a position such as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and w@@ alty .
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by using Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ lo@@ hn@@ ans by autom@@ ate automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation is higher , and the social conflicts are deeper , and the social conflicts are lower , as it -- are already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; thus we need to un@@ ite the economy and re@@ un@@ ite the areas of economy and politics , and in doing so we respect the re@@ united area of dem@@ ocr@@ acies , otherwise we end the movie &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation can be released . &quot;
&quot; the question is therefore not if capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he has brought to survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is through a dy@@ stop@@ ie , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix , &quot; or through something that society will serve the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what could it be , how could it look like this &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; like U@@ top@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar dy@@ stop@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please contact a capital market , where you will earn money while you are working on the next , and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and arising out and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work there , and staff who do not work there . no pig@@ s between capital and work , no big gap between investment and sp@@ aren , and ultimately no emp@@ or@@ rag@@ end tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a free flu@@ ctu@@ ating exchange rates , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trading in this currency is tr@@ acted -- we call it &quot; the co@@ smo@@ s , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; co@@ smo@@ s &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum to the trade defic@@ it or the trade committee of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment resources are . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woo@@ ds Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time not the technical means had to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you , is preferred , in which they prefer privil@@ eged people , and Marx@@ ist , because they bur@@ ied the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ an@@ ic , global key@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we are awak@@ ening in such a world
or are we reconc@@ iled in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar dy@@ stop@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
&quot; thanks , &quot;
Bruno Gius@@ san@@ i : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something from what I just asked is relevant then Marx relevant .
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Tu@@ n we do not , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which calls for Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; by the transfer of this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it is not only our dem@@ ocr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx certainly is relevant , Marx is well relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like key@@ nes , and therefore I am too complete . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you do not find it , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of phil@@ osoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said , Singapore and China and yesterday during the dinner of the speakers have you very clearly said , what you keep from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal dem@@ ocr@@ acies we have the attacks of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area , where the most of the economy is -- a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some way , if I must say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , res@@ em@@ bles China today from the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- we re@@ mind you -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , histor@@ ically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liberal , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what you can watch in China now , res@@ em@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now prefer@@ able to do what the West in the 19th century has done , get rap@@ h@@ ed to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers would be cur@@ ious to your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I cont@@ ests that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new start ; &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , leaving us from the self @-@ f@@ ences , and the lasted den@@ ial that ran through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massive endanger@@ ed the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to agree on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , which revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it right to do . unfortunately , the powers have chosen within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continuing the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to get an economic system that is not vi@@ able , through political will and author@@ it@@ ism to life , it might be quite a while , but if the change happens , he happens ab@@ rupt and destroyed . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any errors in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who return -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is an finance minister , or any minister that claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake made , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believ@@ ed that there was a honest interest in the money editor , a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they only wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they did not want to deal with the violations by the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to con@@ clude that she has led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal B@@ IP .
&quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika is im@@ posed to im@@ posed this policy : &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of conversations , you seem to be quite an @-@ European @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ved .
&quot; for if they are not survi@@ ved , the frei@@ ght mur@@ derer shall be dem@@ onic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the whole global economy .
we are probably the stron@@ gest economy in the world .
&quot; when we come to ourselves the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , wh@@ ach it appears , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are in this point wrong .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for that you were at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most still never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
&quot; this goes back to the decision , the Roy met three years ago . &quot;
Roy Price is conduct@@ ors with Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , t@@ acos . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content of the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard cont@@ ested industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not be able to select .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
in other words he must find shows that are quite right on this curve .
this curve is the application of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the evaluation dates from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; breaking Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where you ask one season , your brain as@@ ks : &quot; &quot; where there are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve because I think you have already special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as .
&quot; he makes up more thoughts on the average output , the average TV -- shows that neither good nor bad , they simply delight not . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon makes it something that is why I want to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where they can watch everybody free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon want to figure out , g@@ ently you find it right ? &quot;
millions of suppliers look to these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed in the appearance of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team all this .
&quot; you capture , when you start the show when you see , which parts can be ski@@ pped or once again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com of four re@@ publi@@ s US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many may remember this show because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average @-@ how -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not just what works to Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has a top show through data analysis . its name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for finding this a super @-@ show and it also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of a contest , he and his team found the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews which shows the shows , their course shows , what shows them etc . &quot;
then use these data to find these little details on the audience : what shows them like the producers which actors .
&quot; when they had all those parts , they entered a wag@@ on and not decided to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has suffered a hit , at least for the first two ... &quot;
house of Cards &quot; receives a 9.9 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course is the question : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very kom@@ ni@@ tive , data of se@@ aled companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what lies this ?
because the logic somehow appreci@@ ates that that should work in everything .
&quot; if any millions of data coll@@ ects , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computer .
&quot; the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect , is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis are so not working , then this is something fri@@ ght@@ ening because we live in a period in which we make more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no . OK , that is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this space ever in touch with this software . come in touch with it in prison .
&quot; if anyone is in prison in prison , and to dism@@ is@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dischar@@ ge is done or not . &quot;
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad is decided whether a person is good or bad .
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence of that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results created . this is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data are se@@ aled companies only be wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google is sometimes errors . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can explain through data analysis of flu , the narro@@ wing kind , pre@@ cau@@ tions , -- through data analysis of Google Analytics . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sens@@ ation . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfect , year for year round , until it was no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply not worked , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data is se@@ aled companies such as Amazon and Google are sometimes something .
&quot; despite all of this error , data , in decisions of life is a -- in the workplace , in practice , in medicine . &quot;
so we would rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ assi@@ sted gen@@ etics -- an area , where some very clever people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy ! &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you are mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as the first step , you can analyze this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the parts ; as a branch set the parts set together to put a dischar@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how machines , can only help create a problem and understand his parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to res@@ et the parts and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all have it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something that is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back again , even if the information is in@@ complete to put a good relief -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful , because they have been used and used where they are also in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand how they would not be able to understand them otherwise . but the decision , how to take all these parts , again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
so Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their choices , first as they w@@ ished by TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; this tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired results .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong , if data are starting to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how fe@@ b they are , data are just a tool , and to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to get the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
I will end it later with a techn@@ o .
I have made some decisions made in my life so I could hear in the ball on the ball .
&quot; but , as you of course know if you have the data available , you want to replace them through something much bro@@ adly , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the principle .
&quot; so , the ball sound and cl@@ assy and cl@@ assy . ultimately , it lies in us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right . &quot;
&quot; and I think this as a very encour@@ aging news , that despite the great multitude of data always pays out to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
