<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won as New York Times-Reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before each one had heard by Edward Snowden, wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA illegal telephones have heard from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but it is another chapter, which should be left a lasting impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein he describes a catastrophic US-intelligence cooperation in which the CIA was literally drunk for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, whom the chapters at all did not fell?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government has been established against Risen and calls him to call his appropriate sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train it became a symbol for the pattern of the government, Whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen ankees, he did something that many mighty reporter already did before him: he weigered himself and said that he would rather go to the prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so from 2007 to 2015 Risen, therefore lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"then, only days before the process, passive something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though she was imperative for her case, the claims of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of fail and cry to bring statements to the statements, that also could do his digital footprints for him. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so have the mediators, without His consent, his telephone at home,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its e-mail data, financial and banknotes, his credit card, and even maturities with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they are used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblowers and risk."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised at his trial, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than any US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government can become much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first Constitutional Constitutional Treaty, because the government has always more possibilities to do all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government permits, the rights of reactors to handle, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed they can record them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afternoon, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source system for whistleblowers which was originally developed by the internet's most famous, developed by us and has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, when I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a messages website, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access the respective news agency."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government cannot complain the government anymore, and many of the information that would be request, would not be available from advance."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world develop new Spionagetechnologies that are all endangered us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to ensure that not only technology-denominator as Edward Snowden have one way, disputes have to be misunderstood. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the talk about abuse at the care of soldiers, who wants to tell. or the next environmental colleague will be reporting. or the next environmental colleague, the alarm on sepulated water of Flint suggests. or a pilgristreet turn, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our of all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">"thanks,"</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3. April 2016 the biggest data bacon of history was published.] [which means that?] [we baten Robert Palmer from Global Witness about an explanation.] this week we were taken by news about a leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Moso Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and Lawyers to companies such as Mosquitos Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymity enterprise. can you set it up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we are actually seeing the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is rejected.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictator of Bashar al-Assad's wallets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin takes over a close friend of children's, one famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be there a lot of rich people and others, the nervous on the next release, and on the next enthrammed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be wept from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tell us what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful being able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their assets and to wear it -- something that we have been discussing and discovers."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people all the world will be very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I am always like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, in another company what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it may be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were not a prominent Americans who had previously announced in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, it is not so that there is no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosquitos Fonseca less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a backup of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to have connections into the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need to specify less information in some US states, less information needs to create a company as to get a bibliography."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed to complete the employees of schoolchildren to prevent schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has scammers allowed to grasp most vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this sees in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"thus, we sent a direct inventory to the offices of 13 Anwaltsfires in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our inventor gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it really that all until having a lawyer of our mediator proposals made how he could generate his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precautionary. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course, nobody was passed on to the money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which has undergone our promised proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top-political, hidden in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"it may sound all very trendy, as if we could do anything against it; as if nothing ever had changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as an attractive optimization, I really see that things have to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the last few years we have seen suggestions for more transparency and the owners of companies concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill introduced into both parliamentarians, but this makes no progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means used to ensure more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry, if they see how others can hide their true identity behind headaches."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand and say:" Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and employ it, through laws this kind of intransparent."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally put the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped once and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day, after I finished my design study, I made a backstage."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazowda remained and looked up my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and made a trip through all the land. afterwards he would go to peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I lud him on a beer. he told me what he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the error to ask him:" where to fought you for today night? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, Mann! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now?</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I didn't know him just! he says that he would go to the peace, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to end in the trunk area of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk-trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a bubbles. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was in bed, I starralled to the blanket and thought:" "Oh man! what did I find out there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wilderness in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, on Flip-tips for the door, and my sleeps."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought by me today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as the host. it has changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who have been sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, which just waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a newspaper, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my fellow inhabitants are drawn and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can do it, anxiety in fun to turn."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow mates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I got about how we could earn something. our apartment is staying in a designer-bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">"Hi,"</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happier guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on woodwinds.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we also found.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese shines distasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We were touring with them through the whole city. when we got our last guest and the door fell into the castle, starrten Brian and I am. "</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make of it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we would like to send us the investors:" "we want to create a website, on the people, public photos of their private spaces, their bathrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind rooms whose doors can be over."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can then invite you to invite people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be missed.</seg>
<seg id="142">But in fact they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in Trost, would invest in a business, foreigners allowed to sleep in the apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one encountered the things that one can be good. we could desperate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create through design immense trust, between people who had never met."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a costume, which degree of confidence we strive."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock with your left seat cushions.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly flight from panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel, if they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing is more personal than your phone is, your home is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel that unlock the phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they sleep in.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only times like who has actually Al Gores Phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he set up for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail to this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour were imagined once upon his name: if he would have told, where he comes to his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine they would have 150 sites that all say: "he can really be very well unlocking phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to cancel your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-driven feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was hard for the people, negative appraisal."</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their arrangements before we set it online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted with Stanford a study. we understands that people trust each other, depending on how much they are with regard to age and place."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social incidence.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting it is when you add the call of a person -- in our case thanks to Beurdepartments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">"so, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences."</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we drove that confidence depends on how much you are there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a host.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells too little, like for example" Hi! ", you do not get any answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell a lot, like for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the inquiry will not be accepted rather. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Great artwork in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to manufacture this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not counted, the great amount of people who were more than willing to set these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first,: incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, the previously was not covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unpermitted parties or have been wounded apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls were directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front Front if trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing Schlimmeres than this calls. it does not do so if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one heard in the voice of anrude, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, from the 123 million sold overnight stays only a fraction of one problem ever."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confidential one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust is working there can be a miracle.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there is a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts took him into hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to lean on the basis of sevenous activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protective engel which save a life, even though they do not know."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car into hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want, that one feels lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course does not run any stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I asked for the first time about this concept, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money actions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just" "rent" "to call, the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trading, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you see nowadays, this is with fast food to compare. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at every place you visit, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly complete and one in a pub our area, one of which one has never heard before."</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would be able to share apartments from reason to compassion?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if the thoughts have taken the thoughts of shared shared?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and dissemination.</seg>
<seg id="239">In Southern Coreas Capital Seoul this project has already begun. many parking places that the government belonged to</seg>
<seg id="240">Have now been offered here. students who were looking for a pencils</seg>
<seg id="241">Were started to people who were educated to their children. they were started incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. beyond our platform, night 785 ,000 people will be guests in 191 countries guest at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">In front of us there were similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we find that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome low-quality prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing;</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight-overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think of every time when a roter Mazda goes to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but when it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself, what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">"thanks,"</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a braindeer, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security cheque at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so the media people represent, which look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study conducted that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: the Americans mean, most would do not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">"probably, people do not speak with their users."</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great, you know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">"Fujitsu, notebooks"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am an practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ouched me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexuality person, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head-gear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friendship were released:" "why suppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lusatia was: at that time, it was for me a feminist declaration of independence, and indeed with the pressure that I felt as 17-year-olds to adapt me to a perfect and Untouchable beauty."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I made with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked in question, beyond and believed finally."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the cork.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik brings me sometimes to the wolves.</seg>
<seg id="285">I am concerned myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>

<seg id="287">So it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later married I and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had an end-breakfast, looked upon the screen and saw the word" "Eileen." "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people sprangen from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock absorbed quickly in sensory.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the television and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"...,... "in the name of Islam,...,..." "onasted descent...,..." "bombarded Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only attacked my land, but in the NU, the acts of others led by a civil war into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to start into a new city and start with the start-up studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove back -- so deeply moved to my seat, and I was going to be recognized for the first time as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations which besought:" be watchful, "" Be careful, "" penises in well illuminated areas, "" Versammmelt not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then Friday was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for the prayers.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people, which one held for Muslims, to the Free zerrte and clever."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire charges in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who have attacked the country, our country had attacked."</seg>
<seg id="315">I used the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain themselves anderning itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to ask questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the excuses that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually hear people say:" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims and join mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as well as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we bignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is as a whole and a benign tumor can only be under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the U.S., but an essential organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">"regards,"</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympians. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques of America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it will perhaps be released a few parking spaces, but not the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people with other faith, and greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I was a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually radicalised."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process you noticed that it goes online. as the first the person is cut off from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who agree to their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must keep people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still asserted that Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group as the IS set up its brutality with the basket."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to her imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">"regards,"</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has to do so much with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you throwing a look at it, it does not drive what they do in their" Holy Scripture "" LASEN. "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam tell me recently an astonishing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they would have done to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radicale religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom they had spoken, and said their wrath, her sense for injustice in the world, they would only bring into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="350">"of nothing inspired and something that had given their cheut sense, she was a main objective for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of humble for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they left them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a look like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour expression of fear every day to our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear for at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are accepting a autoritary government system that conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if one encounters a test messages, in which negative about Muslims reported, they were rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academical problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims came up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the profield of Iraq war and during two legacies.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to exploit the foundation of a free society, the rational and good informational citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early Warnmark.</seg>
<seg id="367">We maybe feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear proves to all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective blame, it does not only need to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, living in chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athletes.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental Faculty, talented, much promise..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the legest, generous person that she knew."</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in their apartment, as with an execution, after he postponed against Muslims on his facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">"Fanaticism can not only be unmorally, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">"so, back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we worrate it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America would be exempt to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one that we can freely exert our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the Kinderstation we drove to be silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes, went into the commanding, and what I saw, let me keep."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam arose, and called our guests welcome, because half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who have come to us, but to help us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>

<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus a system autonoun work, it has to know collectively, where the mobile objects have to be found."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the swift development of dynamically Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a sampling of our laboratories. "</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to define calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>

<seg id="424">"in contrast to most bottles, it can weakly, and therefore has great advantages for start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedge is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as windsurfing.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter how the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by exercise.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce fundamental abstract questions, which proposes to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"before decades, educated pilots-controlled aircraft were flying, which only two movable parts had: a propeller and a hedge rub."</seg>
<seg id="435">"unfar, we discovered that lie with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanical simplest distance, it was invented before short."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinge and crosslinking, no further actuators or controllobersurfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simplever is happening in the interior so much, so that it can fly in space and can move away in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedge. to bring it to catch, I must take it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it right, if all watch, is low, that is why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is a exercise in commuy, this machine is here, the Ombudsman with its eight propellern, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all of this superflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he will receive the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions no matter in which direction he is filmed or even as he rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest is experienced directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when aircrafts should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propellers aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they behave like a high-performance squares."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or cordless -- can fly the machine as well."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half excursion.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic vibrations.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression. "</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-squcopter -- every single weighs less than a disk bread -- and made them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully they motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine does not want to practice in Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>

<seg id="492">"all that I had worked, is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist of black holes and their through observatories like LIGO brass signals. what are Gravitational empower?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation shaft is a crash in the feeling of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft will be the space and its full content is stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">"to the illustration, lecturers in courses for the Relativity scene often have a right alberate dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dups, stretching and dups."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched from us at the advent of the waves and gesture. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is called 20 Nullen according to the Comma, followed by a 1 Darby explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that's already absurd, the length would have to be measured less than a thousand of the radius of a nuclear power. that is grotesque."</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicist are inventions, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more a ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: faces, the size of your hand."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because then you can create a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">"hearing shades have a wavelength of up to 15 meters."</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to manufacture an image of things that will mean a lot of things:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we are based on certain characteristics such as Toner and height, rhythm and volume, to close to the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, it is said Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underground them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number, Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravity.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not produce easy pictures of objects in the All.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by moving on changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can hear her stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transform the pattern in Schall, we can hear the All literally speak."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to loud, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, what my colleague Scott has already been busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circuits simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional tone-change. that sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement that shaped into the wavelength.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that should never be forgotten -- heard of LIGO follow: [Surrendersound] Jemand, who knows what he must hear this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-facher sunsets, which are about as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we put in short what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, around one hundred times per second, before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to exploration of the age as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can hear the All accord and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can see -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned much about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hidden."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see hindle as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation wastate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urwater: I would never researched the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the Urknall is covered by his own neighbour."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitation, it should be possible to return until the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that is the most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and from which we do not have any idea. things that we just discover what we listen."</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO was in the first sight of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes, like LIGO it observed, the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, urold bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so important the sucking bones for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO makes us an entirely different point of view to the events in the All, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on it as we went out of this chaos. "</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and the caterpillars of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in All.</seg>

<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>

<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the lack of the totame, I can do nothing, except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I erre, the Marathon, which I discontinued, the army, the high tone - they no longer exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is glued fingers and moisture kisses, delicate voices, vigorous things, or the song in which it is squiver, or whatever the girl is in" "ice cream". ""</seg>

<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy market comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly hear, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain at the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the labour sums, the Titanic, which is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you, who you are, if I say to you, who I am, when I describe my brain, and how functional my brain is, then I forget what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current one of the lives of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True sums ignores the pressure of the story that expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums is the voice of God in my ear, but perhaps daring to me God the wrong words, because what God said me that I am a Titan am?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>

<seg id="717">"once my child want to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I have been doing this rule so that I can free myself as a Workaholic of any fault.</seg>

<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"it is not possible to play in such a way, as work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is doing so far.</seg>
<seg id="723">But I do not like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This entry is painful because what a person is working rather than home?</seg>

<seg id="738">"my children show me how one lives, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say it always! Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a postpony."</seg>
<seg id="742">"there you are probably right, but you can also do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they would like to make something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaced me a vision of Ladybug or biseks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and after my tey daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>

<seg id="756">But 15 minutes away are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my charity, my world. it does not have to feel the children. it applies to feel the sums to have a place for his soul-peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it is about joy.</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, books read, read the day --"</seg>

<seg id="765">"15 minutes in the piece, why not full 15 minutes walk?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens onto the energy and I find myself in my office. I heard me to new ideas. the sums has returned to new ideas. I use it in full breeds and love my work."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap and sticky finger, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>

<seg id="778">"it is me schnapps that I am a Titan am. I have never seen a Titan Poker, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my stock will burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>

<seg id="788">I am author. I think things that I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, that means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreumerable.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life may change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurological, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, a very low capacity to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tried to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" deep underground stimulation. "it implanted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an astonishing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under fatigue and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurological is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive valentine and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I often versed patients with Schädel-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain-schwilli and the shredded pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one has to sometimes remove a part of a goker brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of the encaped shepherd, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What my I mean by it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells from a tissue to grow, is comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to let them thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many verses it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology, that stem cells unripe cells may be turned into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain-creature in the OP are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal. "</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They are slowly moving slowly and after a couple of weeks it even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but it was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our large-hiring cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the control of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brazzling out of the non-speaking part, and then the cells just so cultivated as it Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then markedly markings to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we traveled them at the aberration of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we drive these cells into normal brain-webs? and what will happen if we have the same cells in commercial brain?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthier brain, and we watched that they had gone back after some weeks, they go back home. the space is already occupied, so they will not go there."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation of and traveled exactly the same cells and now stayed the cells -- they washed to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were traveled.</seg>
<seg id="862">"proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we practise monkeys with a manual projection.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they reached a stable skill level, we have reached the motoric Cortex the Handmotorik area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plasma brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as if the monkey. "</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, so we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey wishing to recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we traveled the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rich plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use it entries and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to imaging them in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain, there is a means to cure yourself."</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in man."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill about two kilograms papers and forms forms to pass this kind of studies."</seg>

<seg id="891">Jb: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the admission of clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow ourselves the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as a inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchanging contracting.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is imperative to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great neighbors in Beijing have two violent freely that it is possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth while the politics fully undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy in us is in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"in the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could well be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my inflatable friends that would be repeated, if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in together with me, again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup we could save democracy, but that we could need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies will be painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies used."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the issue of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened our tavern."</seg>
<seg id="915">I nenne it the "twins-apples-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the schoolberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognizing its ZWILLING.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unfortunate cash, which belongs to anxious asparagus and corporations, which might be too anxious, where it would be productive and income, with whom you bear the schoolberg billing and also all things could produce that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I nenne them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months in the USA, in England and in the euro area, 3,4 Billions US dollars invested in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, schools, office buildings, schools, streets, parse, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 Billions US dollars a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5,1 Billions US dollars, which compares at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital the twins apples which are not affected by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which could not invest in which they could not invest in which she would not consider that his son will kill him when he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Non-violates the circumstances that lead that oil-pus him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his excess implies all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, human talents and especially all the technologies to finance," green "technologies, which are crucial to save the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue; what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in the open air and the poor as a majority of the government control. "</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenic democracy is naturally too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be an error, the significance of the athenic democracy due to these exemptions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athenic democracy was and is that they have made the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they shall have the right to political co-determination with the same mood in questions of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenic democracy does not have kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very light shines, it is also quick-burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal bourgeoisie did not have its roots in the ancient Athens;"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"because the liberal democracy came first, as a complete separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process was established on politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone was established."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began to undertake an uneven struggle between the two by doing the economy gradually and they entails."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that one can now be in the government and nevertheless, not in power because power from politics to the economy is separated and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadors with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is in about such as a herd of robbers, which is so lasting the animals, of which they nourished, decimed that they are at the end of this reason."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far kannibalised, that it grows by the independent economic crisis itself. the power of the business grows, political goods are increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful capitalism the" demos "" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twins will be the twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obviously that we have to bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea for 100 years ago and it was not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be retreat that the working arms can only regain a position such as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and walty.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by using Niedriglohnans by automate automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation is higher, and the social conflicts are deeper, and the social conflicts are lower, as it -- are already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"thus we need to unite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in doing so we respect the reunited area of democracies, otherwise we end the movie" "matrix" "as a documentation can be released."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is therefore not if capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he has brought to survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is through a dystopie, similar to the" "matrix," or through something that society will serve the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what could it be, how could it look like this" "Star Trek" "like Utopia instead of the" "matrix" "similar dystopie?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please contact a capital market, where you will earn money while you are working on the next, and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and arising out and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work there, and staff who do not work there. no pigs between capital and work, no big gap between investment and sparen, and ultimately no emporragend twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rates, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trading in this currency is tracted -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" "cosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum to the trade deficit or the trade committee of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment resources are."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time not the technical means had to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you, is preferred, in which they prefer privileged people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keyanic, global keyanic."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we reconciled in a "matrix" - similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">"thanks,"</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something from what I just asked is relevant then Marx relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Tun we do not, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which calls for Larry Summers as" long-term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">"by the transfer of this crisis from part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it is not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx certainly is relevant, Marx is well relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like keynes, and therefore I am too complete."</seg>

<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said, Singapore and China and yesterday during the dinner of the speakers have you very clearly said, what you keep from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat this here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the attacks of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area, where the most of the economy is -- a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some way, if I must say this as provocative, resembles China today from the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- we remind you -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberal, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can watch in China now, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now preferable to do what the West in the 19th century has done, get raphed to hypocrisy."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most still never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">"this goes back to the decision, the Roy met three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductors with Amazon Studios, "</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelhairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard contested industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not be able to select.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words he must find shows that are quite right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the evaluation dates from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" breaking Bad "," Game of Thrones "," The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive, where you ask one season, your brain asks:" "where there are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows as" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve because I think you have already special intelligence to undergo "Toddlers and Tiaras.</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes up more thoughts on the average output, the average TV -- shows that neither good nor bad, they simply delight not."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon makes it something that is why I want to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition. "</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where they can watch everybody free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon want to figure out, gently you find it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of suppliers look to these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed in the appearance of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team all this.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when you start the show when you see, which parts can be skipped or once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process these and it results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom of four republis US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many may remember this show because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average-how -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not just what works to Roy and his team."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for finding this a super-show and it also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of a contest, he and his team found the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews which shows the shows, their course shows, what shows them etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find these little details on the audience: what shows them like the producers which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all those parts, they entered a wagon and not decided to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has suffered a hit, at least for the first two..."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "receives a 9.9 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very komnitive, data of sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What lies this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow appreciates that that should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if any millions of data collects, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mindeste, what you can expect, is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis are so not working, then this is something frightening because we live in a period in which we make more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this space ever in touch with this software. come in touch with it in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in prison in prison, and to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad is decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence of that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results created. this is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data are sealed companies only be wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google is sometimes errors."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can explain through data analysis of flu, the narrowing kind, precautions, -- through data analysis of Google Analytics."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfect, year for year round, until it was no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply not worked, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sealed companies such as Amazon and Google are sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of this error, data, in decisions of life is a -- in the workplace, in practice, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we would rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-assisted genetics -- an area, where some very clever people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy!"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you are mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as the first step, you can analyze this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the parts; as a branch set the parts set together to put a discharge."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how machines, can only help create a problem and understand his parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reset the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all have it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back again, even if the information is incomplete to put a good relief -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore I think was Netflix so successful, because they have been used and used where they are also in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand how they would not be able to understand them otherwise. but the decision, how to take all these parts, again and make it a show like" House of Cards "" that was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">So Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their choices, first as they wished by TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "this tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong, if data are starting to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how feb they are, data are just a tool, and to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just need to get the ball to get an answer." "most likely" "-- exactly here in this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will end it later with a techno.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions made in my life so I could hear in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know if you have the data available, you want to replace them through something much broadly, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the principle.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so, the ball sound and classy and classy. ultimately, it lies in us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I think this as a very encouraging news, that despite the great multitude of data always pays out to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
