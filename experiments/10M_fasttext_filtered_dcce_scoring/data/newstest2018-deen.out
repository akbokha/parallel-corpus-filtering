Munich 1856 : four cards you can change your view over the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where people will meet young people today .
a tom@@ b series where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel was gr@@ illed .
small garden@@ ers investig@@ ates the one reason of farmers .
the oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when Land@@ cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everybody who had to rain himself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ oport@@ als as Bavaria of the government government , everything else is currently out - but is therefore very successful . &quot;
especially if one compar@@ es them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities spread in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Mercur@@ y since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ery that you do not realize that such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard were more detailed for towns and municipalities of more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ sheets . &quot;
this emerged according to the specification of the Bay@@ er@@ ische Ver@@ brass management between 1810 and 1864 and ski@@ pping of the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ ern@@ s .
your client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ leader tr@@ aded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second co@@ alition of Austria .
Napoleon wish to get an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic inclusion in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville was finally raised by 9 February 1801 : there were the present neighbours that were the idea of a surface @-@ covered Bavaria map .
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project ahead , founded &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ er@@ ische Ver@@ mess@@ ing News . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich dates from 1856 to 1856 and is like to find all other on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Library .
the comparison of breakfast / Today is the example of the provin@@ cial capital on the most impressive .
the city has stret@@ ched in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses under@@ carriage focus around 1856 along today &apos;s plac@@ ebo road , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peas@@ ants towards Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : while Hin@@ einz@@ o@@ oms appears a smaller card with do@@ zen lines and numbers : handy num@@ ber@@ ed Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so called &quot; ur@@ um@@ ption , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , small pitches there are no farmers more - but small garden@@ er of the plant &quot; country in sun . &quot;
a big green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wiese since 1810 Schau@@ b of the October@@ f@@ ests , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no mix@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only read the road name &quot; at the host@@ ment &quot; or from the height &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once said people with win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard from G@@ ud@@ den , the institution - that P@@ sychi@@ atr@@ ist which is associated with the death of King Ludwig@@ s . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended for example the An@@ k@@ ettes of the so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the personnel to address violence against the incar@@ nation , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later on 500 places was expanded . &quot;
&quot; some@@ time , this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ sir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ AM@@ PER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of the biggest Psychiat@@ ry Germany . &quot;
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er institution now encounter young people in the Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Or@@ den expect the building complex 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east dormit@@ ories from the 198@@ 0s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children of the house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was destroyed by the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; - in architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bom@@ bard@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was around 1856 than &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the purchased road was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Mün@@ chens .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a great continued until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once the Marien@@ hof , where this day work and on the 5th April 2017 the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the air @-@ image of today - and the hole on the Marien@@ hof re@@ plen@@ ished . &quot;
civil @-@ group @-@ group releases fic@@ ming of Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the Promotion of colored has issued a warning for colour@@ ful people who travel due to dis@@ crimin@@ atory policy and the raci@@ al attacks from the state to Mis@@ souri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advis@@ ory for the federal state Mis@@ souri , which aims until 28 August 2017 , calls for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ian@@ er , since travels through the state particular attention and to be expressed pre@@ caution in recent times throughout the state and here are used here in the statement of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to win a dis@@ crimin@@ alization authorities and the criminal law enforcement authorities , the disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate on minorities , said the group , the travelling war@@ fare , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , human beings happen . &quot;
&quot; they are lift@@ ed because of their skin colour , they shall mer@@ ge or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kan@@ sas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear dis@@ comfort in such a frequency , which we have not heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such a warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US .
&quot; the group zi@@ pped inci@@ dents like r@@ ass@@ ist conc@@ eal@@ ed against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under ques@@ tion@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after having had taken no fuel over the journey through the state and taken away by the police of Mis@@ souri in prison .
&quot; the Council also indicates a recent report by the offices of the General State of Mis@@ souri , which is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it will be gu@@ err@@ ation or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ souri negoti@@ ated in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ breaking after the latest figures from the h@@ ass@@ ing report programme of the F@@ BI who enter the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th position of the country .
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law , which would be harder to spend a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had already been adopted for Texas and Arizona , after the States immigration legislation had passed the local criminal law enforcement authorities to under@@ take people because of the AC@@ LU for further R@@ assen@@ profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but at last time you have stakeholders the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the fro@@ zen project is element@@ ary
the fishing law of the f@@ ence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on site .
&quot; at the spell of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the fishing bacher CD@@ U , together with may@@ or Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann did first give insights into its operation , in which he 55 hectares of meadows , and 40 hectares of woods cro@@ pped , 40 mil@@ cool@@ ed and also host many young animals and houses five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Mil@@ k &quot; is for him the alternative @-@ market path for the milk of his co@@ ws , so swi@@ vel . &quot;
at the table of the holiday guests only comes to Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of fisher &apos;s fisher , he describes the ordination project as &quot; &quot; spont@@ aneous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not be mis@@ chiev@@ ous areas in the art .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much of them can be processed with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; st@@ ressed swing . &quot;
in 2003 he assumed the el@@ event@@ ual operation and gener@@ ates these without any chemical plant protection and d@@ une , even if he does not run a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the ordination of the company , and is pleased with the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope so that the insur@@ rection of the faces could still be exposed to a whole while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and to think about how they continue to continue their operation , &quot; st@@ ressed the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often present in criticism
more than 25 pitches were f@@ enced in 2013 in a total of 25 plots of eleven participants .
the right @-@ lasting surface is therefore 40 hectares that may not be consum@@ ed until at least 2023 .
&quot; from the total amount of 71 500 euros the half of Le@@ ader was funded , a quarter carried out the village of fisher . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers 12 610 Euro , which had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ f@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac st@@ ressed : &quot; &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and farmers it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also , for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; here are best foods produced . &quot;
Land@@ scap@@ es ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state promotion of Wei@@ de@@ grad@@ ation .
the aim is the re@@ vocation of the Black @-@ force .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR identi@@ fiers .
&quot; in addition , the f@@ enced area may not be in non @-@ pass@@ able area ( H@@ ang@@ n@@ ection over 35 per cent ) and must be threat@@ ened by the insur@@ rection . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing bacher Weimar project 2018 , currently the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots , which would like to build just 16 kilometres f@@ ence . &quot;
the re@@ development area corresponds 35 acres , the low@@ ed costs are more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp the Statue of Liber@@ ty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change it is when they begin to att@@ acking the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful fall of Sadd@@ am H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp @-@ regime , did not know what he did , when he did a symbo@@ lic A@@ xt in a h@@ ay dispute with Jim A@@ costa by CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic restri@@ ction of leg@@ alized immigration with the Statue of Liber@@ ty . &quot;
to stay fair , Miller handle not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boot@@ camp@@ ers and liber@@ ty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have it ar@@ yn@@ thesis if he had done it .
&quot; but he writes their significance , and especially the meaning that it was written as the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as an Miller A@@ costa l@@ acks : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liber@@ ty is ... an icon of American freedom , which is illumin@@ ated the world . &quot;
the po@@ em that you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liber@@ ty .
&quot; Miller is in@@ accurate right , but as he form@@ ulated it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the rising words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immig@@ rants , but the h@@ ass@@ le of the poor : &quot; your ef@@ athers , your poor , / your fri@@ ght@@ ed masses who walk afterwards , freely to breathe , / the el@@ end of your rich chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; &quot; completion &quot; &quot; on our screen was better to see . &quot;
Miller &apos;s not in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ m@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict to the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - did not know that they were a high political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by being presented in an ab@@ used classical im@@ aging representation of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their po@@ em is the femin@@ ine figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she is himself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ ile .
the connection of the po@@ em with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist co@@ p and a dev@@ ast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed , the people wanted to change from the right wing this long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Sch@@ rei@@ h@@ als Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liber@@ ty any@@ body , but rather an early neo @-@ serv@@ ative to die Welt &quot; &quot; Lady Liber@@ ty is pro@@ g@@ ressing . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to be illumin@@ ated the way into the United States .
pretty un@@ usually is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something different .
the significance of the statue is entirely on a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consi@@ sted in it , as they seen from the ex@@ haus@@ tive , el@@ enden , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible jour@@ neys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense that the world from the perspective of people to see , the refu@@ ge are looking for and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and will to hear them .
&quot; and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tru@@ mp ever would like to know . &quot;
&quot; your tor@@ ch is not supposed to enlight@@ en the path , but the h@@ ate that is the only source of power , ign@@ oring . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ded sch@@ ot@@ tical members of the team of Great Britain
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle remin@@ ds of a time , as only two sh@@ all@@ ots to the team of Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; the performance of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ royal cont@@ ing@@ ent in the World Championships is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of sch@@ ot@@ tic ath@@ letes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that in Scotland has to learn something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something out of it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue it , until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people at the Scot@@ tish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did .
the sch@@ ot@@ tic ath@@ letes think that it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scot@@ tish ath@@ letes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - the fight against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle from the crew to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is rather hum@@ ble .
&quot; their capit@@ als was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of ath@@ letes , no matter whether they were s@@ ot@@ tically , or wherever they live or practic@@ ing , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and genuine feeling , the rush of id@@ h very naturally brought , were great . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ Silver med@@ alli@@ sts , which is at the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les with the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible , that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British team are . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of ath@@ letes at the world champion@@ ship was seven , which were in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the middle @-@ sh@@ afts Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year , five British and two European records in the past year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5,000 m . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,@@ 500 m runs , is another sn@@ ort that you are looking for a great season that included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remin@@ ds of their first world Championships as the only other sn@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; the teams &apos;s capit@@ als says that they are &quot; tremend@@ ously &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of its citizens do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; this is special about team capit@@ alists , lies that it was elected by the other members of the team , but knowing that my team will have voted for me and have chosen to me something special for me , he added it . &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots , who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established ath@@ letes , ath@@ letes , who want to rise to poetry . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a capit@@ alists ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home champion@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is really important to put on this home@@ support and to benefit from that we are back in the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block of Kri@@ tik@@ ern via Facebook : help you not to bear a public office if you cannot bear the tw@@ ist of laundry .
the Father of our country did something of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington but it lasted not long , until the newspaper him because of all sm@@ ote , from the internal policy to its political principles . &quot;
he sho@@ cked at the cri@@ tique of criticism .
but he did not put his cri@@ tics into silence .
&quot; for the year 1783 said Washington : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , du@@ ms , and st@@ um@@ m we are led as the sheep for batt@@ les . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to the Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ ogan , who must work to work more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have block@@ ed the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted which have expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union condem@@ ned him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ ab of the govern@@ or left the fight@@ ers as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of an object with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ ogan .
&quot; this is a re@@ publi@@ ci@@ ous govern@@ or in a overwhel@@ ming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the two daughters of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary h@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very well sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his clothes and play@@ back his hairy head to chem@@ otherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore the block@@ ing of persons who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is considered officially referred to and by employees who are paid with public tax dollar - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ In Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of drums or sp@@ amm@@ ers , or h@@ edge people who s@@ ail online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were block@@ ed by H@@ ogan .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a ent@@ repren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ ll . &quot;
they all said that their comments are resp@@ ect@@ ful , thoug@@ ht@@ ful and not prof@@ essions . &quot;
&quot; the priest , the Bible c@@ ited the Bible in its post and appeal to Ho@@ gans Cath@@ olic faith . &quot;
&quot; Law@@ y@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ill , but she asked for h@@ ass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed that there were no reaction to h@@ ass@@ ver@@ breaking and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people takes on the same topic position , then they will be seen by some more than such a collective collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; focused spam attack &quot; &quot; would be other probably &apos; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to cut a message by simply block a cri@@ tics or a negative comment .
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in early time , if one had done the same that employees were dischar@@ ged to collect newspapers with critical refl@@ ections , and to dec@@ ei@@ ve or bring the prot@@ esters . &quot;
but precisely that happens straight digital .
H@@ ogan is not the first public officials that it is cri@@ tic@@ ised that he has imp@@ lied the Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is block@@ ed by Twitter users who were block@@ ed by his Twitter @-@ Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Supervis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County promised the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. Department of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they called a vot@@ ers from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ ent@@ ucky received Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also a visit from AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time Q@@ ing@@ tons had the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers are multip@@ lied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous post@@ marks on his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington anonymous Tro@@ lle .
&quot; people who were pse@@ ud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; J@@ uri@@ cola &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions . &quot;
&quot; Peti@@ tions that have collected his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the boat trip with great Britain , overwhel@@ med by the historical documents that were collected from the Online Papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ a@@ waiting at home comforts at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ ael will hope in the next three days at home comforts , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an was held in the 25th edition of Scot@@ tish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led back in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end , before he carried out against Paul E@@ ales and functions as a tournament eholder at the name of the club meeting and CE@@ O@@ s Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ ael . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job than he put this place .
he is a ei@@ fri@@ ght@@ er fe@@ eder of this game and is proud of his performance here .

&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend ones@@ elf for the first time , even though he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly at &quot; , &quot; said in South@@ port heated players . &quot;
&quot; I have not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it had won in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary or@@ r that came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first fes@@ tive appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scot@@ tish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more , if you play at home , &quot; said or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want it well , but you feel also this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it has gone .

&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , an ancient Dutch colony , which was recorded in Indonesia as only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ d@@ est by a public transportation . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which changed for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and foreign journalists or legal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially registered in Papua and West Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as is the eastern part of the island . &quot;

&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child care centres in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesian Gold .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a Hoch@@ land@@ Provin@@ z in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,@@ 000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort alone was built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars Gold and Cop@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these stim@@ uli are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua that ensure the Indonesian @-@ military military has ret@@ ained a delic@@ ate presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local mil@@ estone involved and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single offic@@ er . &quot;

&quot; according to the data of acti@@ vi@@ sts , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 from the Indonesian military . &quot;

&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the dem@@ ographic development is changing , since the Muslim @-@ inhab@@ ited islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;

the former carpenter int@@ ed 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts have broken because we have agreed 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that the justice will be restored , says You . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Pan@@ i@@ ai is actually only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep point . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang the Christmas party in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers in a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the sle@@ pt children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an@@ ach in her sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , dr@@ unk , hunt , and sm@@ ote the group with their thre@@ e@@ ons , said victims and witness . &quot;
then one of the soldiers in the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult be@@ aten that he fell into the Kom@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was put in fire and the things are escal@@ ated on the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Commander to demand justice . &quot;
they tru@@ st@@ ful Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle are continuously and a bird @-@ minded im@@ i@@ animal - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e p@@ ago trunk .
some prot@@ esters started stones on polic@@ y@@ - and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses were more than three times , they were dead in a official document of TIM@@ E which has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for rest and ur@@ ged the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned off , I suddenly turned into my left wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the veranda of his colorful wooden building . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not , who lost , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the here gathered soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots have been folded , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was made three times , so his co@@ usin@@ s , the witness of the sho@@ ots was . &quot;
&quot; I burned to him and tried his body to go safe that he was , said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is like many Indonesian he only carries a name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ at@@ sp@@ ector of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters that his offic@@ ers said their stop only &quot; &quot; wanted because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ ught to kill us , &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ man of the Papua New Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators have been killed and many more bre@@ aches . &quot;
the news about the k@@ els were only filter@@ ed on the following day &apos; filter@@ ed &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks of Jok@@ ow@@ i held in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate talk , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of victims and weak@@ ened , the historic abuse in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I would like this case be resolved right away , so that it will no longer happen in the future . &quot;
&quot; security sin@@ ian hosts said in October 2016 , that he made a out of court @-@ able mechanism for the in@@ fl@@ ection of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the ex@@ chat began almost immediately .
&quot; most violations are assigned a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have oblig@@ ed to move these violations , but there are processes that must be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then I made a re@@ treat when he said on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E , and said , he has no plans , in Papua a compl@@ aint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto that has given the UN for crimes against humanity , which has been called for crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been adopted , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai proposal . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ pping un@@ belie@@ vers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I fear , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have been afraid to be arrested by the military , have been afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ aco@@ bus recover the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the inci@@ dent .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to bur@@ ied four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I bur@@ ied the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting are not stopped .
on Tuesday sh@@ oss the Indonesian police on vill@@ ag@@ ers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confront@@ ation between vill@@ ag@@ ers and the manager of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who wei@@ gh a conscious male to hospital , died a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk than he died in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
fro@@ sted vill@@ ag@@ ers are prot@@ est@@ ed before the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ ag@@ ers of stones on offic@@ ers war@@ ps , which re@@ vers@@ ed by using War@@ n@@ sch@@ üsse aus . &quot;
but loc@@ als say that the mobile b@@ rig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot and a fat@@ al .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ ven@@ ge &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was near the hospital home and witness , how the last here is quickly included . &quot;
&quot; I have hi@@ ked me two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai @-@ Parliament has invited to attract the participating offic@@ ers to account the participating offic@@ ers and to withdraw the mobile b@@ rig@@ ade of the police out of the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ h@@ eh@@ er@@ d for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of mean@@ ing@@ ful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al that live in the green highlands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many sh@@ aves the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ ar@@ me@@ e , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua , by def@@ ensive attacks and kid@@ n@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; as a reaction to the years of thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and will@@ ingly taken into awareness , under the pre@@ text of &quot; sec@@ uring the national sovereignty . &quot;
some do never dive again on .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is for loc@@ als too expensive . &quot;
bread is just as range .
the people here build everything they eat : mainly emergency fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of confection@@ ery .
they keep the most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian R@@ up@@ ien ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new emig@@ rants grew since the opening of new flo@@ od@@ ds to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger number . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which is in the region , usually go to the better educ@@ ated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Papua have sel@@ dom the capital or the necessary skills to introduce their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the president of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , the coverage of the reporting international media are stra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ den and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua de@@ por@@ ed , although they were given the rare permission to the film . &quot;
&quot; according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the constitu@@ ents of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns , the restrictions of reporting to take to promote transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journ@@ alist who are trying to report from Indonesia and the West @-@ eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua . visa @-@ tor@@ ding and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neigh@@ b@@ ors Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March a six Pacific @-@ fish states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the reception and the Arab @-@ islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investig@@ ate the &quot; various and widespread bre@@ aches &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ ät@@ erei . &quot;
the same countries have histor@@ ically supported the O@@ PM .
the spok@@ es@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir pointed the pre@@ matur@@ ity of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system ; and there is free media so that it is difficult to negoti@@ ate the evidence of human rights .
people on the spot want to take note that more foreign governments are taking note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ mess@@ enger K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May visited , bra@@ ved their silence and fri@@ ght@@ ened him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that will also participate in the session , but anonymous . &quot;
Indonesia has to say a further pres@@ idential election but the Papua say that they will probably not be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by men who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ ussen , says Gob@@ ai , the leader of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that there is living under the constant threat of a raci@@ al military . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; you do not need money , they want just righte@@ ousness , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation led to the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ op@@ fer , the last symbo@@ lic act of the Trot@@ sky , was bur@@ ied on a terrain precisely to the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never give justice , but at least they do not forget the person responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ aco@@ bus with bul@@ ge head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;

&quot; it is the second fire , which is set in only two years by the Hoch@@ haus , that is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;

&quot; an examination through the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 , that the largest portion of the damage caused by the Cover@@ ing , ex@@ cl@@ adding or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates to isol@@ ation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ ob@@ fur tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire could have contributed to the approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p during the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in H@@ o Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup , single only supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ th@@ n not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set @-@ classi@@ cs remain the traditional tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ith , therefore only barely lack@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership won &apos;t have the whole reform@@ ware for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the review .
&quot; at all , not only for the vote was after many tests before that the proposal came to be carried out on a neutral place . &quot;
new since 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round the host @-@ law .

more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ eller brings hidden objects into the plane you find out a survey
a survey conducted by air @-@ pass@@ ages that more than 20 percent are deli@@ ber@@ ately deli@@ ber@@ ately bur@@ ied items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration passing , including at least 6 per cent which bet@@ ter@@ ing the plane while being acci@@ dent@@ ated knife or other objects with bl@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent de@@ pt@@ ed , they had del@@ ayed that they have been del@@ ayed with Sch@@ uss@@ ors , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a Jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out - introduced the younger travellers rather the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents that they know that they know , with something to fly , which was prohibited by the T@@ SA were 19,@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common objects that were pic@@ ked at T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent gave to , knowing items with bl@@ ades through the security control over 2,@@ 2 percent of the female sur@@ plus and 3,@@ 7 percent of male survey also confirmed that they are inten@@ tionally de@@ pic@@ ted drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , there have been sent travellers throughout the country to find out how many reconc@@ il@@ ful sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware brought by the airport security and how many it could be done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people who visited the most thr@@ illed sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or ign@@ or@@ ably - by the safety , those were the most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA policies are a little complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often un@@ certain that liquids they are allowed to take and how much of it .
&quot; therefore , it is not a surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA certified items are reported . &quot;
&quot; a time long thought , the T@@ SA could watch books as dirt ware . &quot;
flu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers canc@@ elling Order
electric gli@@ de El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so he has under@@ gone so that a part of the clients has already res@@ ign@@ ed their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s numbers to re@@ generated sales and still gig@@ antic Ab@@ on Mus@@ k , the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly balance , for the first time a different , less g@@ loss numbers : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
Mus@@ k has often used over the past few months with over 500@@ .000 pre @-@ orders for the new car of the delivery .
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders have already been with@@ drawn again 6@@ ,000 again . &quot;

when cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , sp@@ atial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of all about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , believes the Tes@@ la boss is not . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge at ambitious growth potential is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la 84.@@ 000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 , it is supposed to be combined - all models - 500,000 to 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who today is a &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; orders , at the ear@@ liest of the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la it creates , its brand @-@ new , never in practice to drive without greater inter@@ ru@@ ptions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts have doub@@ ts that this is possible .
&quot; but , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ binding of the reservations to become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot assume un@@ satis@@ factory customers in Sch@@ aren &apos;t . &quot;

&quot; Pru@@ itt announced in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year to study his authority to study more time to study the plan and to avoid themselves in local choices or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp pro@@ sec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ahoma , was a long time a reliable opponent stri@@ ct@@ ing environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt will have to be repeated and hes@@ it@@ ating to block the chemical industry and industry of fos@@ si@@ s fu@@ els . &quot;
the su@@ dden re@@ vers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal back for the Pru@@ em@@ ony Roll@@ back Agenda .
&quot; last month has decided to have a federal court court in Washington that the EP@@ A car@@ et@@ akers has passed its authority than he tried to negoti@@ ate the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ ane checks . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wedn@@ es@@ days old position , Pru@@ d@@ ently asked the willingness of the EP@@ A at Oz@@ on@@ ets quite simply the willingness of the EP@@ A to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; among earlier administr@@ ations , EP@@ A often did not hold the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then cont@@ acted by activ@@ vi@@ st@@ eng@@ groups and other states , and in an agreement reached the date for the execution &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who tried the EP@@ A more than a do@@ zen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by juris@@ di@@ ctions , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which there is us serious . &quot;
&quot; however , the EP@@ A means that the ple@@ ats will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legal claims available to make sure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress pus@@ hing for an extensive re@@ vocation of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; during the last month of approved law , the implementation of the rules should be de@@ emed at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet completed in the Senate .
&quot; the New York State of Govern@@ ors , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man who directed the co@@ alition of the states , who said the EP@@ A on this week , said the group inf@@ sec@@ uring the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EP@@ A - after our Kl@@ agen - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are affected by the smo@@ g , which flows into their con@@ greg@@ ations , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

the smo@@ g smo@@ g may cause sensitive groups of people serious breathing problems and to contribute every year thousands of premature death cases .

&quot; it is trou@@ bled , how much pressure it takes to get this r@@ ational step by the responsible for the protection of the air , which we arrived at Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological clo@@ sen@@ sus of the Tru@@ mp government , to poll@@ uted and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ bled celebr@@ ates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anni@@ hil@@ ation of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lings on Sunday , 16 . July , at 4.30 pm at a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;

so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 appears , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still to recognize the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the glori@@ ous settl@@ ers of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 subj@@ ected to these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ age law was created from the early medieval equity .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , and served by a priest , continued in this church , and could also dev@@ ast@@ ate this equity . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a par@@ ish or to propose to the bishop of a new par@@ ish . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two zer@@ em@@ st on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was first for the first time 16@@ 92 , but needed later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16 @-@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pul@@ leys and the bells are st@@ olen .
the roof was in@@ tight .
1796 of the French troops near the church .
they bro@@ ke the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threat@@ ened 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 the tum@@ linger called Hil@@ arius , the tum@@ ult cemetery also served as the last retirement for the dead out of listening . &quot;
1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche abandoned .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ tower you left .
&quot; in the New Years night 1834 , a storm the Cher@@ ry tower and half over@@ heated one . &quot;
to prevent an un@@ happiness that the tower became broken .
only the existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g is still preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ ori@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em of the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system . &quot;

Association wants to check the approval of windsurfing
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ouldn &apos;t be hon@@ ored , no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Council of the Council . &quot;
the Association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ouldn &apos;t be hon@@ ored by the Council of Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , its approval for the establishment of planned wind tur@@ bin@@ es in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind tur@@ bin@@ es could have been approved as at the time in Vi@@ ers@@ en just at the border with Schwal@@ m@@ tal a wind power zone .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind tur@@ bin@@ es are generally possible , at the same time the concentration of the wind tur@@ bin@@ es for the rest of the city area . &quot;
Der@@ lei zones should prevent a &quot; spar@@ kl@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; while the city of Vi@@ ers@@ en had a few days before by a change of the plane plan , a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , but the District Government was not approved because of a form of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing @-@ legal requirement is the ert@@ able per@@ missions to be returned to as before illegal , and therefore , Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ouldn &apos;t be hon@@ ored . &quot;
current status of things : the city stood before the summer@@ time again the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District Government is still building .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is at this point the redi@@ stri@@ bution of a permit for the establishment of wind tur@@ bin@@ es legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; the respective letter have entered into the circle of Vi@@ ers@@ en since last week , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes her on the occasion to check the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view on ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle am not wanted to adapt to the argu@@ mentation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , an affiliate of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high cycle . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company was involved in which the town of Vi@@ ers@@ en medi@@ ator is involved , P@@ acht@@ ver@@ t agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great joints . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four winds of wind tur@@ bin@@ es , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to a fifth of the current state of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the past summer of Vi@@ ers@@ ens City stood green light for buying three wind tur@@ bin@@ es in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind tur@@ bin@@ ders in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .

Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : acti@@ vi@@ sts lead r@@ ass@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercur@@ y drove through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ inking onto the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came forth to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ ob@@ s - a man middle age in a needle @-@ piece @-@ suit - took a long turn on his cigar@@ ettes and op@@ pressed by the wind@@ shield .
inside flo@@ wering the in@@ lets in fear .
&quot; we want this n ! &quot; &quot; h@@ aste &quot; &quot; the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
write down the still@@ ness as a young black man from Bei@@ j@@ ers@@ itz .
&quot; luck@@ ily is this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a post @-@ position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck by &quot; Roger &quot; is thro@@ wn , silent nearly all in the audience very real ju@@ eu@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Ci@@ ore &apos;s Ford bridge come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford bridge back to the night , where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody has ever been indi@@ cted because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is truly imm@@ ort@@ able that in all these years was not a single person was arrested - although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ r@@ one Bro@@ oks who helps in the organization of post @-@ creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt rect@@ angle on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ old former con@@ gresses of the State of Georgia and a life of citizen .
for him the review as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that has never been fixed .
&quot; we want sec@@ ution , we want to finish , we want healing , we want to reconc@@ iliation , but first we must receive justice &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconc@@ iliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a se@@ du@@ el presents a tow@@ el on the suffering of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI @-@ Ak@@ ten , who were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were driven from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been indi@@ cted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on open foot for decades , civil liber@@ alization , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice had made up the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the pres@@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to details of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ tom Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owners , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - suppos@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the sm@@ ells in the city have been that H@@ ester sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy sle@@ pt and that the baby they carried out , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her co@@ usin@@ s of Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they came from prison to the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford bridge to reach a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that the Mor@@ de prepared and arranged , it includes a F@@ BI @-@ report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a con@@ clu@@ des between state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the mur@@ der , evidence has been removed and the identity of witnesses has changed . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulated it even more pre@@ gn@@ ent .
&quot; it was a leg@@ re @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade long has Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene the annual desc@@ endants of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; your representation is vi@@ vid , and is founded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that he would like to believe in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we are then confront@@ ed with its heads in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you do not want to hear or hear not what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day pus@@ hes almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen past@@ ure , and the rest black - into a space and loud , as Gre@@ ene a well @-@ split overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss c@@ lan@@ ow , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dir@@ ty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story on life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ en@@ field , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the neck and bur@@ ied him , w@@ ander that he has sle@@ pt with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , dis@@ appeared from my property ! &quot;
sh@@ en@@ field re@@ eds the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh@@ s at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ en@@ field . &quot;
he is al@@ arm@@ oured and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need the har@@ sh &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly as shi@@ fts the energy in the space , a feeling of com@@ rad@@ es replaced the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four bap@@ tism people . &quot;
the scene begins even once .
&quot; this time , if sh@@ en@@ field says the N @-@ word , he says it shar@@ p and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no man lau@@ gh@@ s .
this repeti@@ tion ends and quickly .
&quot; there are shame , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a grap@@ e @-@ dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and per@@ ish Bil@@ lie Holidays traumatic stress &quot; Str@@ ange Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it is a group of about four do@@ zen swe@@ aters and te@@ ars from the eyes .
the audience is almost like divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , enrich@@ ed to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they all spent almost eight hours long Georgi@@ an moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels like the air . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer to come and to insp@@ ecting the body . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken in their minds , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and fle@@ sters each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ dering a small boy , when he re@@ mind himself . &quot;
after a couple of minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actor are thro@@ wing the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l path and w@@ ishing their te@@ ars .
&quot; Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man played in the suit , who has played the C@@ lan@@ mit@@ er . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ en@@ um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and breaks down in her arms we@@ pt together , the emoti@@ onal load of the insur@@ rection finally with him . &quot;
&quot; it is ok , leaf one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that out of one reason . &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ ded a white couple from At@@ lanta enrich@@ ed over the after@@ care with a black couple that they have just met .
&quot; Denise Du@@ pl@@ inski fig@@ hts to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear this terrible words and de@@ eds to hear ... of people who look like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really is doing with me , makes me believ@@ ing that the Lyn@@ n still continues to go , &quot; today she is called the police @-@ shooting . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ r@@ one Bro@@ oks Hof at his table he ten@@ st and remin@@ ds of the civil rights .
&quot; he said , he started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the off@@ ence is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the scar@@ ce of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not know his own history , who does not know his own history is condem@@ ned to repeat them . &quot;

Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about it .
&quot; you remember that the audience grew up with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said briefly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding of its view . &quot;
I d@@ ressed a positive resol@@ utions .
max lot works as volunteers
they work in her volunteers at the same time in several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the Mö@@ bel@@ ser , once a week I reply here in Gre@@ ven in the seagull . &quot;
and I already worked in open all open day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young adults , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now they are 26 years , so a late volunte@@ er volunteers . &quot;
how does it come ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a buil@@ ders , we say to be successful . &quot;
I realized for me that it is for me and I want to make something else to work with people .
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; do a social year , since there is an insight , since you can see how it may be on site , in the field maybe even , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual course , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;

with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was exactly the right thing I was lift@@ ed .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really exp@@ ires .
unlike in the construction of civil studies ?
&quot; quantity : na clear , here it is not about to be expected . &quot;
you always have other humans to have a head that each have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refuge@@ e , whether a youth , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you must always go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch @-@ time ?
amount : I am not the guy .
it is a field that gives a lot .
lots of love , much kindness . &quot;
there are also negative moments but so life is life .

EP@@ A returns decision to delay the smo@@ g usually according to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the US environmental protection authorities has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama to delay , which are committed to the states , the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states the agency because of the stri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to do so called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ visions 2015 &quot; , and said , they show the commitment of the agency , with States together . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EP@@ A @-@ Chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June the intention of EP@@ A announced in June the intention of EP@@ A , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s tox@@ ic emissions , in order to specify where deposits have to be made to delay in exc@@ essive air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , rei@@ ght@@ ened on Tuesday kis@@ s and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has attemp@@ ted to res@@ ume a wide range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama has ris@@ en , as part of a wider Agenda , the according to Tru@@ mp the economic growth is supposed to return . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have trig@@ ger@@ ed the withdrawal of dem@@ ocr@@ ats and natural vulner@@ abilities , which are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A says the website of the EP@@ A says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the Oz@@ on contains &quot; &quot; the le@@ ase function &quot; &quot; as well as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities I want Community
&quot; at the end , the decision was clearly stated : at two oppos@@ ites the simil@@ arities of a river winds at the establishment of a common room in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing land@@ lord was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard . &quot;
&quot; although far , it will still take it to the far the community of the community belonging to the community of the community , but there is now no plan@@ etary awareness for that of a private investor to stem@@ a project more . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion concerning a shared area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the community to come . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , he would have a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council , such a common room , not as a meeting place only for the residents of the retirement area , but openly into the con@@ gregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made from &quot; &quot; Kn@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; in the past autumn , the decision is decided by providing funds for the ongoing budget already in the last autumn . &quot;
the building is located in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared area would be , so reported , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decisions immediately visible to sign@@ alis@@ e the investor that it is not rej@@ ected to him in this respect , that both saddle is reduced - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the body @-@ height decre@@ ases and the construction of economic power - they would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
when &apos;s help : un@@ anim@@ ously passes the board .
it is not that easy goes on the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which you do not want to move right now on the common room from the window , says them : &quot; I do I do so difficult . &quot;
Yv@@ onne state speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a commun@@ al participation .
it is behind it a conc@@ eal@@ ed subj@@ ection to the contr@@ actual or foreign investors .
&quot; that is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you do not give away , but also come to a real , in the branch of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is . &quot;
&quot; state application , the decisions made accordingly , finds three fears . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two oppos@@ ites in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ izing : &quot; &quot; if we con@@ clude the decision so , we make a Ries@@ ling horse in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the main point is the balance in the team . &quot;
this was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in the first official session of the season .

at the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in the Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; star Train &quot; is to emer@@ ge .
this is planning the Club Stern@@ war@@ te Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a plan@@ etary path is available in Göt@@ t@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a star cycle , I come to the information of many res@@ ign@@ ers , was called it . &quot;
&quot; connect nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to keep track along the planned route and inform you about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; In@@ quiry For@@ ms St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ heg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards shall be sup@@ plem@@ ented by internet .
&quot; therefore , in the sit@@ ing selection a good mobile @-@ network reception plays a role . &quot;
also bar@@ rier @-@ free is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ing train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring , the vie@@ wers will learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star stronger lamp than one other , even though it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; in which con@@ stell@@ ation , will also be convey@@ ed in which con@@ stell@@ ation of the star and when he is best to see . &quot;
the Association operates already since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ t@@ chen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest located con@@ stell@@ ated North Korea since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the Federal Republic of the Federal Environment Agency for nature conservation on the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy are clearly visible .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt it has been on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göt@@ t@@ ingen somewhat simil@@ arities like the planned star @-@ value - the plan@@ etary weg .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ al@@ lee , which forms the inside of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ na ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ ork with the individual planet - including the di@@ ap@@ rot@@ ated di@@ still@@ ed Plu@@ to on the end point - are exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth would be shr@@ unk to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters diameter , while the exact 75 meters away from the sun is at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
the entire distance of the plan@@ etary weg@@ es is a good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are thus faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fix@@ tures but would last a half year .

Gar@@ cia stret@@ ched the right hand and said : &quot; How do you go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ age on Satur@@ days at 19 o &apos;clock at the ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos posi@@ tively , not@@ ched Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas , that a possible show@@ down between the fight@@ ers would be the &quot; perfect size of order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; re@@ minded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am se@@ aled for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on lightweight .
and he must move on lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
those demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ b@@ enko &apos;s un@@ anim@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boxes needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; cli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko will fight with a 135 @-@ pound deb@@ ut in this year to agree on the fight against the winner of J@@ orge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight era in the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all the fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and express@@ es later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he called Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fight@@ ers , and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Trinity Champion from River@@ side view &apos; very slowly from , sorry E@@ ey ... you just want the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show head@@ lines , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could build the Mom@@ m who built himself to your own fight . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which must be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work because , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have been on the top @-@ fight@@ ers , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four im@@ ply after ty@@ re
an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four persons were partly hur@@ t .
after the first information the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 am shortly before the junction market probably probably after a ty@@ re @-@ place control over his vehicle .
the wag@@ on to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he ret@@ ained himself and then remained on the roof in the green .
the four adults - two adults and two children - were partly hur@@ t in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the lif@@ ebo@@ arding service , the A7 was locked towards north for about an hour , subsequently the traffic could be guided on the left side of the head . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ oked after the 2 : 2 on the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points will bring . &quot;
&quot; with the first Se@@ as@@ et was Andre Hoffmann , with the result , they were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two contr@@ ent@@ ore too much , and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the Trinity is to be optimized also further .
and a gate after a fre@@ eway want to do the reproduction as well .
for the future it will be so no more adjacent to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is also better right after the experience in preparation with the tri@@ mm@@ ers , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; still I do not know how we will act in Au@@ e , but Hoffmann is certain that his thing is certain because we have just in the tri@@ mm@@ ette in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Cast@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , but that we are even better harmoni@@ ously and we do not afford so many choices . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether one cannot speak on a draw from a mis@@ sl@@ ed start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the achievement could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the poker room , we will certainly speak of a proper place . &quot;
his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I only ask for six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the player from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fresh , since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ap@@ ert@@ ed avor@@ ites in the b@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ propor@@ tions , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; namely , the guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we seek them away , just because we have the right to come under the first sea , is blood @-@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games are quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to hit by advance , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; a such statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t , arro@@ gan@@ t and sur@@ veys . &quot;
and so I want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ er published
&quot; the recent results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subj@@ ected to a new way to the medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Agency for For@@ ens@@ ic medicine ( puzzles ) has started with the execution of tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to be more accur@@ ately during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Mig@@ rations authority ( Mig@@ rations ) for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees has been cri@@ tic@@ ised , the min@@ t @-@ year were . &quot;
&quot; until today Mig@@ rations has been sent 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency now has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight percent ( 2002 ) were assess@@ ed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency ad@@ minist@@ ered that the person might be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion that the person is probably under 18 years old .
the tests will only be done in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency , the results are taken during the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily signi@@ fy that the asylum seek@@ er has ger@@ ed over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that the under@@ tried person were 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det im@@ posed the 581 published results , they asked that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age con@@ vic@@ tion , in case of ray sa@@ wing and MR@@ T recordings are analy@@ zed , which are analy@@ zed by dentists and Radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ok@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute to see his work assess@@ ing the biological matur@@ ity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency def@@ ended however the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it , if the person is less than 18 is , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are coming well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete , on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach installed . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders at the department of road industry and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg . &quot;
in April the work began at the same time at all three main bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the completion is planned for October and suffering is sure that the schedule is held .
&quot; the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a curved bridge from concrete , which is bur@@ ied with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 m . &quot;
built in 1900 it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges also , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings will now be thoroughly clean . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both have been er@@ ected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively twelve metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the middle of the morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ els .
this is a random mounting which is used as a operating path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , on Friday , a 2,20 meter width is to be used . &quot;
it is then to pass the pedestrian path .
&quot; this special thing is that it is about manufacturing , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already reconc@@ iled with the pat@@ ented Br@@ ück@@ els .

Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful prot@@ est at German Kartoff@@ el@@ sal@@ at
&quot; it is not so frequent before that parties move at a string , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , along what else is difficult to bring about a hat . &quot;
&quot; the political parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that indicates that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell is inv@@ oked to the &quot; &quot; big elect@@ oral fac@@ ades &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who along with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top choice for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the Vice President Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but who are afraid of the event at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ gh@@ ers , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains coloured . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; is planned at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has been there .
&quot; and what Chri@@ sta Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organis@@ ators , really is looking forward : &quot; &quot; great how many people come here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ ian pot@@ ato sal@@ ad , which could also easily eat the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have heard many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vul@@ kan@@ ei@@ fel tells us for such an event and the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation since because of the already re@@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking is available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , trial , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ en@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the gat@@ eway @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Jun@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall some 200 listen@@ ers , which are waiting that the nickname for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice President Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch hold its speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unchanged , the police offic@@ er , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; somewhat more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 p.m. CET . &quot;
the police can abr@@ asive - no special pre@@ cau@@ tions .

both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European excellence .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire to exc@@ eed the borders on their instruments , but also the limits of various gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; this sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new thread , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with bul@@ gar@@ lic folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz W@@ og@@ ram , mix classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating total picture . &quot;
this piece of the program was first premier@@ ed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it pec@@ uli@@ ar for the two musicians and even more : the has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ kirche with their particular aco@@ us@@ tics will be aware of the concert .
Kri@@ sten St@@ ewart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese , and will eat him until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I would like to try everything , so Kri@@ s st@@ ewart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; if I found once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as a neigh@@ bour ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , the ultimately bit@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; despite this in@@ sured the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ ation compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in everyone seriously who I was film@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; or believe her about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation was thr@@ ust that they be bis@@ exual , : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believ@@ ed in it . &quot;
so it has never been conf@@ used or imp@@ aired .
&quot; I never liked it , not seriously taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially as I suffered it according to &quot; B@@ ang Show biz &quot; but in the shoulder @-@ time , when they prefer like a book : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I eleven was told me the children , I would look like a book . &quot;
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ght@@ ened and ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; well show me back and think I : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public do not want to live her lov@@ emaking : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and the an@@ gry me .
&quot; and perhaps consider me some as und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justi@@ fy myself from all the public . &quot;
Govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the Party
&quot; the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thurs@@ days with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the dem@@ ocr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many pra@@ yers and much im@@ pose ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifest@@ ation bro@@ ke in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it is at the time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke previously a major announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice were not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice that is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes represents that he poss@@ esses co@@ hl@@ em@@ ins in five states and inher@@ ited from his father a lower shop .
it is worth 1.3 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thurs@@ days spent an explanation , in which it said , &quot; &quot; the Party Change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would like to work rather than in order to make our country back great . &quot;
&quot; with just 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the last rej@@ ection of a party that is from above to below without guidance , and not im@@ posed to find a positive , uni@@ fied message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ gue &quot; hon@@ orary &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping @-@ sk@@ andal
&quot; the global head of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ by@@ ing on Thursday , what he was described as an expl@@ oration of Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeti@@ tive , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded again in the sport . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the evening of the athle@@ tics of the athle@@ tics at the eve of the athle@@ tics of the athle@@ tics that the ex@@ ile of his land from the sport was correct and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; he said , there are sorry for &quot; all ath@@ letes , which were car@@ ved by competitions in competitions and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments voted the I@@ A@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the Forbidden , which was reported in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) references to the state of the d@@ oping d@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response to a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the whole congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized in itself , that she has experienced some rather hot times and everything is done to ensure that the Federation is newly designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; pleased about that Russia would accept the criteria for his re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress have been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ letes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system . he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian ath@@ letes will begin at the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as a neutral @-@ pri@@ ced actors .
&quot; the leader of the I@@ A@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , that Russia should meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; threats are still in@@ adequate and Forbidden Trainer still be free , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a presentation at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;

&quot; we condem@@ ns us in front of this highest victim , which took them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year Stab@@ sh@@ au@@ pt@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen stayed on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their s@@ aints were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a Tot@@ en@@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral of St. Peter .
at the mid@@ day only the families took place in the church good@@ bye .
&quot; after that , the grap@@ e party began in the circle of the family , the friends , by representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
below was also H@@ ess@@ ens prime minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general principles of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; grap@@ es made ro@@ ses , the relatives were an arm in the arm to the singing . &quot;

Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik will not want a grave on his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be appointed after his death by his wife . &quot;
the shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally the Danish king@@ doms of Ros@@ kil@@ de is set to the Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculpt@@ or Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard finished already a Sar@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
the qu@@ een agree with the decision of her husband and was it further in the message .
where Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik bur@@ ied , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to put in his French homeland .
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik never had a h@@ ehl of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ illing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
&quot; he went up to retirement and also places the title &quot; &quot; Princess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function , he wanted to see himself on his wife as equal to - also not after death , stated L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the boss @-@ stock in the Danish König@@ sh@@ hall . &quot;
where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year will ultimately be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be set in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the past 50 years .
&quot; Hen@@ ri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later woman , the sympathy of the people had always fle@@ w , prince Hen@@ rik in his nearly 50 year @-@ year reig@@ n in the Dan@@ i had a serious stand . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography of all Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , cri@@ tic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sul@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap , instead of stri@@ cken , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I was instead of Virginia @-@ Tab@@ ak , and the call for the call had the reputation , the brand of soci@@ opoli@@ tical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy to be pleased with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
these were the same two errors ! &quot;
Premier W@@ eil wants rapid re@@ mark
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red green ruling class for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of the country , he wants but not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he said on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
previously the surprising dischar@@ ge of a green MEPs from their land@@ day@@ time in Lower Saxony the Government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was de@@ posed to a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the official date of the day @-@ day election , the red @-@ green co@@ alition in Hannover thus the red @-@ vote majority in parliament due to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous green @-@ level El@@ ke T@@ jacket bur@@ ied their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their election in Rot@@ enburg ( desert @-@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ action@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend to his group to record them .
&quot; with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP are together 69 seats in the lower land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was in@@ verse .
the new land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state of the government now decide whether in this situation they could gover@@ n without a majority .
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil is however , however , it is essential for indisp@@ ensable that the land is mod@@ elled as quickly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through her further proceedings .
the provin@@ cial capital also sees the possibility that the land@@ s@@ ake of the Prime Minister the trust is fo@@ stering and choose a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these opportunities have to be legally checked to legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will answer all questions in rest , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ ires step &quot; but something cur@@ ios .
the politicians even emphas@@ ized : &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or .
I feel very well . &quot;
it is referred to as a trailer in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demand@@ ed the dism@@ ant@@ ling off @-@ up for the return of their land@@ day .

&quot; the fr@@ action of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ western extraordinary . &quot;
they have deli@@ ber@@ ately decided to lead to a foreign language in the Group .
&quot; in front of the background that there were no other cont@@ ingen@@ cies , we cannot go this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ ors Martin Schulz sent@@ enced to the over@@ head of the lower green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ ax to the CD@@ U as a ver@@ board .
&quot; the behavior of the former green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to the laundry and laundry , but also Ver@@ rat on red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , the country &apos;s day quickly to choose from . &quot;

&quot; land@@ lady in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Land@@ wehr sm@@ ini@@ ster Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) is talking to the Edi@@ torial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
&quot; I can only encourage all consumer internal and consumers , the eggs in your refrigerator exactly to look and to check the st@@ amping pressure . &quot;
on the consumer back@@ portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ hut.de provide the provinces to date the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even though , if after all we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di accepts the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - , because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the federal state is not really noticed ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the provinces .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has swit@@ ched immediately off and is since acquain@@ tance of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just as the manufacturers to bear for concern that the sold products can be wrong and Health@@ y are un@@ imagin@@ able . &quot;
if at eggs of the back@@ war@@ nings of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exc@@ eeded , these are not wrong . &quot;
un@@ loads eggs can however be sold and consum@@ ed .
this time are not the farms to bl@@ ame .
sit and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after the current knowledge , the production establ@@ ishes no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must count on the basis of mut@@ atis@@ m illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little cont@@ am@@ ers too little cont@@ emp@@ or@@ ers .
is it missing only at the staff or at the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the actual controls that have been revealed . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food @-@ fish and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consequ@@ ent compensation for such action and the transfer to the pro@@ sec@@ ution of the pro@@ sec@@ utor can be present in which off@@ ences are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made several times a few times that I expect the competent authorities by the responsible authorities .
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m on food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer &apos;s consumer and consumers have the right to get used exclusively safe and wrong food .
&quot; if a non @-@ universal ins@@ ecti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer internal and consumers are right@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by the pan@@ pan@@ te funds are manufacturer , dealers and consumers in a situation , which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; generally , it must be clear : the illegal deployment of the ins@@ ecti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l in the position of food @-@ grade animals is not acceptable and must be immediately ended immediately . &quot;
it has to consistently work and work with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atom@@ ic co@@ hesion is swi@@ ft@@ ly and seam@@ less .
how the financial regul@@ ator of Foot@@ ball on N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aims to prevent the issues of European foot@@ wear , N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Wel@@ tre@@ kor@@ n transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the U@@ EF@@ A , because the con@@ duc@@ tive organisation , which has been monit@@ ored the power , teams of access to the pres@@ um@@ et@@ ric Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that have been launched by U@@ EF@@ A to life in 2011 that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has to be financed that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed with no major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) paid to purchase the Braz@@ ilians from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ inity that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars moved to France .
&quot; we can make sure the money lo@@ cker , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring it into an gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy of rich rul@@ er family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may apply for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but have to legi@@ timate commercial sources , which allow them to the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in their way to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel plat@@ ini after its choice to U@@ EF@@ A Pres@@ idents in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believ@@ ed that people had taken enormous debt on their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ru@@ ined if banks or owners were with@@ drawn their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shi@@ fted from the focus upon deb@@ ts of the clubs on monitoring their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change is important that the novel model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used 2003 in Chelsea , - a club with potential and then powerful investment to build the team and build a global brand - become a t@@ ough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P con@@ fis@@ c@@ ation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although plat@@ ini was fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his U@@ EF@@ A fol@@ lowers of Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to dis@@ able to dis@@ advantage of exc@@ essive issues . &quot;
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will set the rules for the future again , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible at U@@ EF@@ A for FF@@ P , to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out @-@ cl@@ ause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ ices over the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement so that the dis@@ solution for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has been together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG was awarded a money pen@@ alty of 60 million Euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which was subsequently reduced to 20 million euros in the 2014 / 15 players in 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual 25 player . &quot;
&quot; U@@ EF@@ A is looking for clubs which might try to over@@ bur@@ st their funds through companies that are linked to owners of a clubs , which are charged with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company could be the PSG spon@@ der if the value of the sponsor@@ ship was exc@@ eed the standard mark@@ ings , the U@@ EF@@ A would not be regarded as legi@@ timate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly the happened 2014 , when the U@@ EF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PS@@ A approved by Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PSG @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the organisation of the World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but , and Kat@@ ar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be and a such man@@ eu@@ ver for the U@@ EF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PSG mean that U@@ EF@@ A has still attention to attention , to consider the rules to deal . &quot;
U@@ EF@@ A had no pres@@ cription talks with PSG on N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars transfer , said to the Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not gu@@ ed to discuss the same situation . &quot;
&quot; the last published reports show that PSG ProntoSIL 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last year must be released .
&quot; we expect that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ de@@ als , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ ph@@ ur . &quot;
the association proce@@ eds that the turnover after signing up at least 30 per cent will increase .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly mis@@ ed to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and tried to prevent no@@ ey@@ m@@ ars track by taking claims that the FF@@ P would hur@@ t . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; finan@@ ci@@ ous d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the latter owner . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the pre@@ cep@@ tible of La League against a State , which is financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of Foot@@ ball in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you may have different ways or have different interests when a country has a great actor to re@@ present a country .
Swiss Life in Search of a new Sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ thodon@@ tics
in recent years cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ chocolate are made for Swiss .
&quot; now , the sense of cooperation is standing in front of a possible end : the air@@ line writes the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ In Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A related report on the &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
according to current planning , the Airline in the first half @-@ year 2018 will become a new contract . &quot;
the products would be checked for every two to three years and is subj@@ ected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white sk@@ elet@@ ts up to 14 grams of divi@@ de each year the air @-@ accompan@@ ying before land@@ ing to the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make any information about the costs .
&quot; area of industry appreciate the order volume according to the North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss fran@@ cs - the mig@@ ros daughter gener@@ ates an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss fran@@ cs . &quot;
yet important is all@@ em@@ al of the advertising effect : for a shot manufacturer it is a pres@@ tig@@ et@@ ric order .
&quot; how many applic@@ ants , there will be the new tender , the Swiss wants not betra@@ yed . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come .
&quot; according to the time , cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an renewal of the contract over the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the SD@@ A , the largest Swiss Cho@@ colat@@ es was not re@@ achable for an opinion . &quot;
chocolate boards spread Swiss Life since 2006 on board of their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Call@@ eb@@ aut , had been delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss before two @-@ half years with the start of cooperation with cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

as always the exhibits of the best part of the fran@@ ch@@ ise .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art from &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; indicates , whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old kis@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they are the moments of random mad@@ ness that could show this fran@@ ch@@ ise &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; until he reaches that I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years later , whose final scene will show the Ban@@ de how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; now remin@@ ds to a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The &quot; &quot; in the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ tone @-@ I@@ KON@@ O@@ GRA@@ PH@@ IE . &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; at the middle of the morning , in Rot@@ t@@ ingen @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rot@@ t@@ because , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects is search@@ ed , like the pro@@ sec@@ utor Con@@ stance on Friday morning . &quot;
the ages of 25 years ago and 77 were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 and already written liability against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials visited greater quantities of mari@@ juana and Kok@@ ain , Sch@@ uss@@ ors , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two sus@@ pic@@ ion Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
at the action were Italian and Bay@@ er@@ ische Er@@ mitt@@ ler .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia , organised drug @-@ crimin@@ ality , serious violence , ver@@ sion@@ ed mur@@ der and rob@@ ber@@ y and em@@ pres@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; even since summer 2016 , the pro@@ sec@@ utor Con@@ stance against organised drug trading in the southern German area . &quot;
between the pro@@ positions in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo was an active replacement and medi@@ ator of the kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ ale had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ use of the Wedn@@ es@@ days were accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of tests of studies , especially Italian nation@@ ality with regards to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a pre @-@ fall on 27 May in Hü@@ fin@@ gen , at the early morning several shots were pl@@ anted into a Gast@@ stätte in the morning , is likely to go to the account of the ban@@ de . &quot;
way to compl@@ ain big g@@ aps in the for@@ eig@@ ners of the for@@ eig@@ ners
&quot; data from citizens , which should not arise , &quot; : a report gives the for@@ eig@@ ners of Germany have significant def@@ ects in Germany . &quot;
the lead to part grade deb@@ ug@@ s at asylum procedure .
&quot; the representative for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen way , has been given a media review to large g@@ aps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ centr@@ al@@ Register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ects in the data registered data could lead in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; in an analysis , which is in an analysis that is the &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register , the information is recorded by ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including around 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will be managed by about 600 apprentic@@ es authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been kept sufficient for the data of data in parts so far .
&quot; in individual cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or from citizens , the German citizen , and in the register actually no longer emer@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data @-@ per@@ missions , re@@ curr@@ ing processes can be substantially more slow@@ down , it is called the report on further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about com@@ pris@@ ed people are cap@@ tiv@@ ated to the EU citizens , which would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such wrong ordin@@ ances led &quot; &quot; to a consum@@ ing debate on dealing with extin@@ ction &quot; , &quot; it is necessary to be analy@@ sed in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has obviously begun to return refuge@@ e families with under 16 @-@ year children to return to Italy if they are submitted by there . &quot;
&quot; that goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is called , the BA@@ MF lead such processes &quot; for families with children , except for sec@@ ts and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , the newspaper using reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first reach it first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant entered into another EU country , this state can withdraw him into the entry and return . &quot;
&quot; to substanti@@ ate the office now : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with min@@ ishing children in Italy increased substantially . &quot;
Italy have given a guarantee for recording and accommodation for families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ MR ) keep this ple@@ d@@ ges for adequate .
&quot; also , other EU countries would withdraw refugees from the Dublin Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the political speaker of the Lin@@ ks@@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children are threat@@ ened because of the def@@ ects in the Italian asylum seek@@ ers of human rights , and a haz@@ ard of the child . &quot;
two @-@ track results achieved
&quot; total 220 lit@@ res of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , individuals presented the blood range for other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens who were received on Friday .
&quot; according to all works of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who are now shared 100 lit@@ ers in the meantime 50 lit@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; traditionally worthy of the church in the session of the community , the multi @-@ fold willingness , blood to sp@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , like our body is laid out and we delic@@ ate the don@@ ors that make their blood for for@@ eig@@ ners , nor the may@@ or of Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood flow helps several people , &quot; explained by the round@@ ed head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ C ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves will be replaced in its components . &quot;
&quot; so , three people could benefit from one blood @-@ saving . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher from the promotions that are carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 Sp@@ en@@ ders the two @-@ best result , &quot; said the DR@@ C @-@ Kreis@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theater @-@ house has been led to higher participants at the age of just a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Meta bl@@ eb@@ erry for the multi @-@ test@@ ers and were awarded for 50 accompanied blo@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; half as many ver@@ bs Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tamara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter ten times the 500 mill@@ il@@ ites of their lives . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will likely be announced later that the interest rates shall remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations of an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth will remain in family than they are the interest rates on family members in the middle of an enhanced printing .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates , whereas in this month fewer members a rise is increasing , since the weak economic growth has increased the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure in the autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that over the next few years , they would be necessary to grow from the Bre@@ x@@ ite inflation and she said that the credit costs may possibly take more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members voted also to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Con@@ jun@@ k package , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial investment plan to provide further funds for banks after coming February , although it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deci@@ ding on the interest rate the Bank : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ gn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak ( B@@ IP ) in short notice weak , since the pressure on the real@@ ign@@ ation of households continue to be charged to consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates they repeat@@ edly repeti@@ tive that &quot; a certain fir@@ ming of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &apos; slightly greater &quot; extent necessary , when the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets pro@@ gn@@ os@@ cope with the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank st@@ ressed that increases &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forec@@ asts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the in May pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tiz@@ ed 1.3 % and 1.3 % .
it has maintained its growth for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell to these messages towards the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und fell by 0.5 % on 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change is coming after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth rate the rising expectations on a cell , and the B@@ IP in the second quarter of 0,@@ 2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; the growth will be expected in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the newest in@@ fl@@ ation report offered slightly enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and lower sal@@ aries , since the tight@@ ening first is even worse before they will be better . &quot;
&quot; you added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot prevent the income , but they added to the wages to the end of their three @-@ year pro@@ gn@@ osis &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ ed to the weak pounds which is attri@@ but@@ able to compens@@ ate a portion of lower consumption . &quot;
the decision has a year after lo@@ wering the interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that was caused by the sin@@ king of the pl@@ ines .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; in front of the final jud@@ gement of the Bank to the interest rates , since inflation was increased to the pressure on hard dis@@ counted households , whereby three political decision makers in July a rise in 0.5 % demand@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; inflation is de@@ clin@@ ed in the last month of 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said to write the exc@@ e@@ eding to her aim of 2 % be &quot; quite &quot; the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco M@@ ort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the short@@ com@@ ings of the S@@ wap @-@ R@@ as is likely to be more competitive , since the credit card will seek to search for shops and end the year in positive way . &quot;
the market looks especially good for those who run the existing de@@ als and the new mort@@ gage inst@@ ances and many with toll @-@ free options and low ru@@ ps are becoming more popular .
NH@@ S ( National Health service ) is to be cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ fied HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people write
patients will be preserved from September after a struggle before the High Court against financing the drug in NH@@ S access to a &quot; Trans@@ former &quot; HIV prevention . &quot;
&quot; NH@@ S England was well @-@ known that one before the intercourse det@@ ective , phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the Inf@@ ection risk for approximately 86 percent , now from health service over a first three @-@ annual student for estimated 10,000 people will be delivered . &quot;
&quot; he said to finance the process , after the App@@ eal Court had confirmed the trial of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , for pre@@ p despite the claim to pay for pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the election announced by the NH@@ S England head of Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ference @-@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations that be taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines that are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or twice prior to intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question , are pregn@@ ant or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ssexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified with participants that the study will agree , including males , women , Trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be known as anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
people who live in England who live in England and sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will vote £ 10 million and NH@@ S England signed a contract to delivery the drugs within this week after an international competition .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p , which are collected and implemented in large scale , as it is implemented in large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful endeav@@ ors to improve HIV and over@@ hau@@ l .
it is another mil@@ estone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity .
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold ; Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted towards the vulner@@ able and endanger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epi@@ dem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this NH@@ S @-@ financed attempt to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was mod@@ est , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV in@@ corporation . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shad@@ ow @-@ Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome , &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due to the government and over@@ due consideration . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ing this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and may termin@@ ate the transmission of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect persons , and that they contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot;
life live : mezzanine and cle@@ ver@@ e Designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ note with a passion for real estate , simpli@@ fied 2014 from a large house in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it lies on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold out .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I tried to something , which was comparable to my price . &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I love me in her and made a quote on that day .
&quot; since the first tour the 1,000 square metres was completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
originally a A @-@ room property with a closed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; says them . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they gave the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was able to take advantage of high ceilings , which was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blan@@ ket was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was consi@@ sted to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
of@@ fan had to think it to solve the reservation .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were wi@@ red , without that we had to b@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height or down the right height at the top or bottom . &quot;
&quot; this order allowed to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full of height - with a lot of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine looks a classic coupling window by retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us via the uni@@ ous residential area .
&quot; Ges@@ pi@@ egel@@ e Gold@@ menu , silver acc@@ ents , and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Light@@ ing put the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
in both En@@ den is a short corrid@@ or mirr@@ ored to leave him longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance offer search@@ ed units for all the bri@@ an@@ gles and glasses of jo@@ anne .
&quot; by the perception of a cosm@@ opol@@ itan smo@@ ms , the beauty of the living room can con@@ clude the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ d@@ able kit@@ chens are nothing new .
this is Fe@@ atured in this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineers went down , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the stahl@@ rein@@ forced , vene@@ ered MD@@ F @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it if you move the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ing use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a enhanced layout . &quot;

brothers strug@@ gling because of a 500 million US dollar property imperi@@ ums
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate imperi@@ en Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Foot@@ ball Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to be clari@@ fied as their property and their business . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a shar@@ p confront@@ ation of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna possess the brothers 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since then the family had bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there founded the West@@ co Jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and M@@ t Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with its dec@@ eas@@ ed father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operators &quot; &quot; and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
any jurisdiction that means that col@@ onists have been owned by 316 million dollars and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has been proven for Paul as a pro@@ gression .
&quot; the proposed of Col@@ in proposed re@@ productions have left him left for the best objects , he wrote 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
last Friday following several sin@@ c@@ ated anni@@ vers@@ aries took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting in order to control over the existing business - from Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul ahead to manage some owners in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , it was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to join the argument . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes about that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading Law@@ yers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides by law firm . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eas@@ ed husband were Italian immig@@ rants that are operated in the late 1950 @-@ years and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Li@@ ano@@ que in the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ k of the family opened .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he was West@@ co there , when he was in my last years of high school , as Paul still had a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their possession to their sons . &quot;
Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in Court .
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark upon leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
col@@ in has very back@@ ed itself although he was a former AF@@ L member member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their families .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &apos; I can really not say much because the case before the courts be .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to spend me and visit our sur@@ name by the dishes , he wrote . &quot;
in the middle 2016 Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father would not h@@ end that Paul and I would say in our current dispute , he said and added that he still hope to have a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ m@@ ps new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to restri@@ ct the media dem@@ entia of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly is actually doing it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tru@@ mp , including reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a regular course . &quot;
here is a piece of Rep@@ or@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , held on his first working day with domestic staff , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ m@@ ps white house that he will repair all the w@@ ool : poor information that enter into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff , that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have attemp@@ ted to monitor Tru@@ mp to supervis@@ e its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ m@@ ps relationship with television ranges decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Candi@@ dat Tru@@ mp was an@@ gry because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to convince him that he was a fair coverage of places that he had to convince the former election of Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key , Tru@@ m@@ ps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it under control , to worry about six former elect@@ oral officials to ensure that his personal media use a constant praise price includes . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea , that Tru@@ m@@ ps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was , is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign could not know what we do not know - that tru@@ m@@ ps were not included without their interventions .
we will likely never learn anything about the Twe@@ ets that the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; when his staff made it a few times , anger of him , then their efforts have been worth@@ while . &quot;
but nobody has consistently preventing it to emer@@ ge the Tru@@ mp cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ sen .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of comp@@ eting parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , President of strategic reasons . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , which was described by Rep@@ or@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp &apos;s officials say that Tru@@ mp can react on negative press sections , especially such with sh@@ utter@@ ing l@@ als , and that he has turned out to find out that they come . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone came to the president , a printed copy of an article by Got@@ h@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , the dep@@ uty secret@@ ariat K@@ atie Wal@@ sh acc@@ u@@ ated , &quot; &quot; the source behind a hit to be of L@@ ecks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson due to Sch@@ ik@@ anen permanently from Twitter , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he re@@ vo@@ gue in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; he added that the former Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to manage a system to manage a system to manage the paper , and documented the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how has the folded ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; maybe he will prove it as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his imp@@ ul@@ si@@ ves self , and its consultants still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ altered factors make cell@@ ars mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ ges@@ u@@ ck Ver@@ bre@@ cher won post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the ten@@ ant of the population is pra@@ ying and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police across Europe will be mail@@ ed in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on dangerous criminal on the escape .
&quot; as the addresses of the don@@ ated heavy @-@ bre@@ wing natur@@ es are not known according to the people , we will be hop@@ ing from the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows on the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; adv@@ ent calendar of the winter . &quot;
the experiences have shown that many fle@@ eing to hide themselves to the holiday resi@@ dences were called by Euro@@ pol .
you have put together 21 post@@ cards for search@@ ed contracts from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , there has been the website www.e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times this was viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online search@@ ed could have been arrested , at least eleven thereof , due to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negoti@@ ate across a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the most prosper@@ ous land@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands stood again with some resol@@ ute travelers on war , which have acted one from the municipality to be returned from their man@@ ors . &quot;
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull that is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of Tran@@ spor@@ ters , after they have been thro@@ wn only in May , without but from one of the Council had been excav@@ ated to prevent their acci@@ dents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense buildings and express@@ es their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; an@@ gry inhabitants have shi@@ fted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , that said it &quot; us@@ eless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous people said , &quot; &quot; you were with@@ drawn on the track @-@ evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thro@@ wn out onto the pas@@ sover . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement into practice , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
travelers have been there in May there and are now back again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; you added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham white , how to deal with it by doing long under@@ gar@@ ments to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , still to pay my community , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ welt who wanted to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of this travelers to be pl@@ ot@@ ted only by another round . &quot;
the numbers have this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorized bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our conference collection , it is very important that as possible as many as many people to report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by call 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation , in which the court must review , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ ken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; for the closure of the hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ tioned ambience operating company mbH to 13 April 2014 the time spent around 30 000 nights per year and also revenue generated by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 the number of refugees came into the farmers , the hotel buildings offered to the land@@ rat as a collection of accommodation offered for cont@@ ro@@ verse discussions . &quot;
the city taken the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the installation of a building industry in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not in@@ cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ al at the time at that time .
but above all Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois master Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interest in the house .
he should keep right .
&quot; the Group Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with business guides , Birgit Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof has acquired the former hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus @-@ category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad man@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; on the previous Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof has been standing for long time Bau@@ sch@@ utt@@ le@@ ak , in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , becomes clear , wel@@ ch extensive renovation works . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were out out , blan@@ kets as part de@@ built , old bath@@ tubs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ State style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there are new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; will be expressed as Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one gets not positioned on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a low @-@ level inner level , st@@ resses Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are wide spread to the lo@@ sers .
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism direc@@ tional Michael Kr@@ ause he already worked as Sh@@ erer .
the concep@@ tions of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
almost less than a million euros .
the outer systems are also brought to the front@@ man that is already clearly visible .
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace that is open from the restaurant , which will be publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ ary : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russian @-@ monkey about US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp is intended to have an alternative @-@ called Robert Mu@@ eller after a report a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; the board was added to work in the past weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; on vocation with the matter of familiar persons . &quot;
the newspaper wer@@ ed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied and intensi@@ fied .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported it already give first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ ene in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ m@@ ps äl@@ test@@ em son and a Russian attack .
us @-@ intelligence services acc@@ ent the cre@@ ml since pro@@ long@@ ed to be targeted at the pres@@ idential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were inter@@ pol@@ arity between Tru@@ m@@ ps Leg@@ als and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation should be several men who are held in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; in addition , Mu@@ eller took place more and more tru@@ m@@ ps priv@@ ates and business environment under the mag@@ ni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Tru@@ mp personally have come into the center and look at the prepar@@ atory decision whether the president in the course of the aff@@ air@@ es may hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to test and decide on the evidence of possible cases , and decide whether the indi@@ ct@@ ment should be collected . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys is therefore also called acc@@ ents .
&quot; mostly they are swit@@ ched , if it acts around bigger and cont@@ ro@@ verse cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
&quot; the panel can also be swit@@ ched by the pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s pro@@ sec@@ utor , to pre @-@ re@@ charge persons for hearing from E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N already previously exhi@@ bited , the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian attack . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asking for a statement to be revealed in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ R. also were Tru@@ m@@ ps consultants and in @-@ law J@@ ared Kus@@ hn@@ er as well as his former election of the Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
&quot; right @-@ left evening ended on Thurs@@ days evening in the U.S. television , that obj@@ ection show that Mu@@ eller let themselves sh@@ ave in his work and that he should be necessary if it should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
but it was not imper@@ ative that the Grand Jury will be swit@@ ched on the end to decide about the survey of an acc@@ us@@ ation .
nevertheless the fixing of the Gre@@ ater of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp .
&quot; in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , the president of the Thurs@@ days were sent a speech in West Virginia , to represent the Russian @-@ aff@@ air as a campaign in his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total In@@ vention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the dem@@ ocr@@ ats a way to feel well , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ or T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he knew nothing of the fixing of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but these work also usually in the secret , he st@@ ressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House fear for any action , which acceler@@ ated the work of the Sonder@@ ger in &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot;
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chief James Com@@ ey have said three times that cannot be established against the President .
you have no reason to accept that about something I have changed in the explanation .
&quot; Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fallen . &quot;
because of this re@@ hear@@ ers were pre@@ cau@@ tionary against Tru@@ mp nois@@ y ; he wanted to beh@@ ave the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate &apos;s committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him to establish an attitude of investigation against the former national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the examination .
&quot; according to the representation of US @-@ media , the White House material against the medi@@ ator and its staff . &quot;
the proce@@ eds of spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller ent@@ ails .
&quot; unlike an independent pec@@ uli@@ arities of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate monkey around the later re@@ vers@@ ed President Richard Ni@@ xon , has Mu@@ eller a position , in which he theore@@ tically led to the pres@@ sures of the President of the judi@@ cial Federal Ministry . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to move such a step but prevention .
two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators took place on Thursday in advance after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be elimin@@ ated so easily .
Antarc@@ tic : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ Arctic has solved a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg by the barely seventh size of Ber@@ lins by the Schel@@ sol@@ s .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ hav@@ ener Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday with .
&quot; the over a few tons of heavy and 58@@ 00 square kilometer , big col@@ oni@@ zed driving is now to the north and will probably have two , three years , until he was mol@@ un@@ ces . &quot;
it is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ic@@ onic suppliers that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no threat to people from him .
&quot; in@@ cum@@ ew@@ ays , climate change has played a role in the dem@@ oli@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear after research . &quot;
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ ru@@ ptions in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Forschungs@@ zentrum für snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a b@@ unch background . &quot;
&quot; after the opinion of many researchers , that can be combined with the heating @-@ heating . &quot;
the now pic@@ tured colony was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Schel@@ del@@ s .
Schel@@ sol@@ s swi@@ ms at the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow at the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Schel@@ em@@ n is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Schel@@ del@@ ses was the balance of wax@@ ing and break down before a few years ago .
a full Schel@@ ses@@ s be there and writes A@@ WI @-@ resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; there are some things , that even the lar@@ sen @-@ C Schel@@ del@@ e is in danger , because the front needle has never been with@@ drawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate under tension and could not fall , if at a cle@@ aring a piece . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ ses@@ s and Eis@@ berg did not increase the sea level since it flo@@ ur@@ ge on the water and ice as much water as it follows after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ del@@ ses , that the gl@@ acier can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the lower size , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ ses@@ s is according to A@@ WI @-@ details with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth stage of the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front to the open ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there is regularly once more .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is aware of the ic@@ acy is now in a endanger@@ ing position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the best re@@ treat since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed even . &quot;
&quot; under scientists be cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ al whether the lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dt will now go back or long @-@ term , and maybe mer@@ ge , his colle@@ ague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers bring down the dem@@ oli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ eberg not to change climate change , so in the past decades a lot of ice @-@ waters of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
this long drive from the Antarc@@ tic extends to South America .
according to the data of the research program of British Q@@ tic Sur@@ vey is the ic@@ onic area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula since the 1950@@ s at 28 000 square kilometer .
the decline has contributed to the decline of the temperature increase .
the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has passed over 50 years around the past 50 years by around three degrees and f@@ enced to the areas where the temperature at the fast@@ est increases .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult , freely week@@ days , the CD@@ U , calls for the CD@@ U , from the working association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer time the circle has 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now we have even 17 train@@ ees their first working day .
the apprentic@@ eship at the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications were to negoti@@ ate for those in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is lack@@ ing to the staff to manage the don@@ ated requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is at the district of M@@ ett@@ mann , still in front of 50 not occupied . &quot;
&quot; for , among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to sei@@ ze the initiative to sei@@ ze together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and entered into administration .
the administration aims at work according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for recruitment and Personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term threats to specialists , but forward @-@ oriented the application of application , it means . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ board and include an ex@@ empl@@ ation . &quot; &quot; CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already a good approach .
for the circle it has to do with a personal problems that one did not exc@@ eed .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is given by a regular &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees comes from health or alter@@ ation from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that therefore not even more places un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Nations , Fr@@ action@@ sch@@ ef der CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application . &quot;
&quot; he has long gone out for a fine surprise for a fine surprise , when he put the human body public in question and the rest of the rest were aston@@ ished . &quot;
peoples would like to be veri@@ fied that all the possibilities will be veri@@ fied that make a dischar@@ ge from the commun@@ al work association .
&quot; if we are not at short notice to a satis@@ factory solution , the circle management with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f cont@@ re@@ es , so peoples . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U is trying to pay better to pay the employees and officials , when it &apos;s the rate of the collective service actually . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pro@@ written , In@@ cre@@ ations or more money is only if one changes into a higher level that is oriented towards prof@@ essions . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have ever more grown over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be arranged in which the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution of the new pro@@ stitute . &quot;
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers have Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fied the sound of NGOs @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has NGOs to emplo@@ y the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue to keep on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said the Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Day La Stamp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat from the German auxili@@ ary organization &apos; youth re@@ saved &apos; because their team has worked effectively with human traffic@@ kers in a manner that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
&quot; the auxili@@ ary organization , which is first in operation since one year , it turned to ex@@ haus@@ tive pres@@ um@@ ing of the Italian pro@@ sec@@ ution Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the salvation of the human life our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search - and bail@@ out zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all be collected , which are currently being collected , first , after we have collected all the information and that the situation could be assess@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had been saved the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ene &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it will susp@@ ected that its occupation is inf@@ latable for immig@@ rants on board , which can be delivered to them directly from traffic@@ kers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such a co@@ inci@@ dence , only 1,@@ 3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast took place , according to the acc@@ te des pro@@ sec@@ ts , the content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is sus@@ pic@@ tured by the authority of the Italian coast@@ line , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves , away . &quot;
under the code of conduct boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a particularly have an Italian polic@@ eman on board who have overcome their activities .
&quot; only three of nine NGOs working on search@@ - and lif@@ egu@@ ards are ready to keep up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules as un@@ necessary , but acceptable would not be seen as they would not be &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their bail@@ out actions . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up is the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Min@@ nit@@ i said meanwhile , that the number of migrants had passed down to the lif@@ esp@@ an measures in Italy , in recent weeks , that the efforts are borne by strengthening the Liby@@ an coast@@ line and cooperation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants , which can reach those countries in hope . &quot;

there are three be@@ fre@@ ed guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burgundy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome .
the first tour led by hot Som@@ m@@ ertem@@ per@@ atures along the vineyards to the Michael@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above Dei@@ desheim .
&quot; it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , one of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the pre@@ h@@ ated levels . &quot;

&quot; F@@ akt is : e @-@ sport has long been to become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high G@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal state , which are increasingly being involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July a E @-@ Sport department , and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;

&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that the young people go still into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs were tried , all possible markets , especially the Asian , too er@@ ober@@ n . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men , one could be present online far more frequently on these markets than once a year to send the federal state to Asia as a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?

and in Asi@@ ans 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it at all about a proper sport ?
for many is the idea certain acc@@ used .
Ingo F@@ seals has a long time to deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport for sports , because he is communic@@ ated and many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classical sport - for example , higher heart frequencies , Str@@ ess@@ reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , it also need k@@ og@@ ni@@ tive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also their bodies and watch the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; hello , but also problems : &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a theme . &quot;
controls be hard at online gaming and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sport .
posi@@ tively explo@@ ited the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are internationally on the road , this is like a big global family , there is no intercultural hem@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verb@@ andes Interactive Enter@@ ing software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport an rapid growth ahead .
&quot; to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments . &quot;
sales revenue grew by 130 million in three years .
against the barely 2,@@ 4 billion euros the football Bundes@@ liga is very little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports species like hand@@ ball , basketball or hockey away , write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez on US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Asht@@ on Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports competitions in Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ first@@ liga has been committed to Dut@@ t , a E @-@ Sport Department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and the old times is clear , today is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is going to preserve the tradition of the association , but the enterprise at the same time set up at the contemporary market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tis@@ ed world , &quot; said also Dut@@ t . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Conrad Roy for self @-@ mur@@ der , Sent@@ enced &quot;
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts was condem@@ ned to two @-@ half years because she encour@@ aged her friend through texts and calls to self @-@ mur@@ der .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind Git@@ tern and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sent@@ enced in June due to the neg@@ ligence of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the Father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfort@@ ing .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the vocation .
&quot; she had been confront@@ ed with a maximum pun@@ ishment of 20 years , but their legal argu@@ ed that both they are and Mr Roy in a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; in red h@@ osen and a cre@@ m@@ ef@@ ly bl@@ use , Carter da with te@@ ars in the eyes , with ti@@ fied hands and down at the bottom of the eyes , when they were sent@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have launched Conrad Roy , &quot; said the pro@@ sec@@ ution of the Court . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; said they . &quot;
&quot; it has no been shown . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , it was a &quot; hor@@ ri@@ ble circum@@ stance , which they are totally un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that you have old age or matur@@ ity or even their spir@@ al disease , have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the occupied that there is no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything I go . I try , despite all my pain , which we shall bear for etern@@ ity with us to be for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she won &apos;t be followed by the knowledge &quot; , &quot; that they will never be part of the wedding of their brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person have been together with which I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ence , since there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , which makes it a crime to su@@ stain an other , self @-@ mur@@ der . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ y po@@ ison@@ ing in a vehicle .
&quot; the case moved national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters &apos;s tex@@ mitt@@ ing , that they had encour@@ aged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; H@@ g you on , spring@@ time from a building , hi@@ ding you yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , she said in several messages that she had sent to his wife during the two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; in the eye look before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you must do , the generator will turn off and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought after the death of Roy and ordered that it will benefit by some press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .

&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that looked like Joshua Kim@@ mins immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi Cu@@ ps , obviously not a Philipp l@@ ah@@ m , and also not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made him bap@@ tis@@ ed off on the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the entry could have better run than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;

&quot; so who was au@@ lic@@ ated , the heritage of l@@ ah@@ m can only move , a small extra motivation can only be used . &quot;

&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new audi@@ o@@ ster Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;

Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Auto@@ producers are confront@@ ed with a counter@@ reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said , BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said , the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are smart options available as c@@ restri@@ ct effects , &quot; &quot; and pul@@ led to European cities - including Munich , where BMW has been based - diesel vehicles to restri@@ ct or restri@@ ct . &quot;
Daim@@ ler gave on Tuesday to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the company described the Entreprene@@ urship as a call .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encour@@ aged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen O@@ xi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ oma and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for automotive manufacturers , systems for Neu@@ tr@@ alization of the aircraft were to install , also take what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
the German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is also indi@@ cted to pamp@@ er the powerful drivers and signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid errors of Volkswagen to avoid using the afor@@ emen@@ tioned devices that regul@@ ate emissions , if a car was tested , but on normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were classi@@ fied by Volkswagen , others are investig@@ ated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former manager of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German crimin@@ als after the authorities have installed an system to handle the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen hard drive : the luxury @-@ automotive manufacturers will be over@@ propor@@ tional to the profit of Volkswagen at .

&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;

&quot; Lav@@ ender is re@@ minded of the conditions and because of the diseases of transfer@@ ring insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , big head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Ch@@ ais@@ se , expert in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; Lav@@ ender in Provence , said , &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the impact of climate change in spring and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small zoo , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that bears the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil lock@@ ers not only for holiday makers , it is also for perf@@ umes and cosmetics very high . &quot;
&quot; Eric Ch@@ ais@@ se said , &quot; &quot; instead of having a very long plant oil with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , COMP@@ AN@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with eth@@ eric oil . &quot;
&quot; to the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water supply , and the slow@@ ing of the plants from the ground , but also the improvement of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant towards dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; there are drugs , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are sus@@ pic@@ ked up , on the back@@ drop of the government or the card , a catalogue of bre@@ eders that make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no ru@@ st@@ ause of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ans , are ever more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto in December 2012 has occurred at least 25 , since then President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto stood in December 2012 , and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , its publ@@ ishers and its inspir@@ ator of Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journ@@ alist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply inv@@ ented , although its presence anywhere there is - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which indicates the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two Rep@@ or@@ ter in the thir@@ ties , wearing T @-@ shirts that his smil@@ ing face with spectac@@ les or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the Rep@@ or@@ ter discuss about their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their alp@@ ine , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , Par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a Son@@ der @-@ nation@@ ality , in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee , has entered into the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked each year with drug traffic@@ king and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely made before judgment . &quot;
&quot; at Rio@@ do@@ ce it still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are im@@ prison@@ ed and even though the terrain is still tra@@ it@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting has the discussion of safety little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id , my time in this workshop &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know that , we mis@@ sed all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of the 15th of May , Val@@ dez left the newspaper of Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provin@@ cial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
he made it just to drive a few blocks far before his rot@@ er To@@ y@@ ota Cor@@ olla was lift@@ ed by two men . he was shot from his car and 12 times has been translated into it , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who will be translated with &quot; &quot; twel@@ f@@ th river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he drove away in his car away and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults children .
sc@@ af@@ els tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but to the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation last year and delivery to the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the blo@@ om batt@@ les of the country , since riv@@ alled fr@@ actions here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day som@@ eb@@ ody or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of consum@@ ed , two @-@ story m@@ ash@@ een for drug Queen , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; rest &apos; if only a card control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs for@@ es in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work was Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the fault in it that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the mur@@ der .
&quot; first , there was published in February the release of a interview recorded with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a riv@@ ate card actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have been den@@ ied the sons , susp@@ ected anim@@ ated band@@ members of each spec@@ imen of the output once they were delivered to Zeit@@ ungs@@ ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was it to force Val@@ dez not to force after the con@@ fis@@ c@@ ation of a different paper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ illing is considered a mil@@ estone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survi@@ ved that his friends and colleagues participated in that he would ever be there .
he worked in 2003 as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este than he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce and 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate a journ@@ alism without regard to the smo@@ ker problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the paper earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ter loved it , hard tre@@ ain@@ able studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories , nobody else to treat . &quot;
eight years after the founding of Rio@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history , where ever she led . &quot;
he gave volunt@@ arily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said to the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to accept the task that falls you as a journ@@ alist - either that or you play the s@@ illy .
&quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in given so many Tot@@ er ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Rio@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was the friend , the generous with hug@@ s and advice was , a teacher , the knew , how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry out his hat .
&quot; he would always sit to El Guay@@ abo , the bar towards the office , go and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , please ask : was his love for routine @-@ ups ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced to ask them to ask their own shares in question , how they can do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they may not like if you live with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their be@@ ati@@ ful start and Land@@ eb@@ ways , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ catering and self @-@ determination . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ onists .
&quot; when it sm@@ ells wrong , keep it away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; sm@@ ell is a sense that can be clo@@ cked ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules as he and others say , in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as much as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a tox@@ ic blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ ging , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government agencies . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Rio@@ do@@ ce for safety stra@@ ining , suddenly there were no Ph@@ ones allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and acti@@ vi@@ sts in Mexico . &quot;
outside of su@@ dden two polic@@ emen protection from the heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were asked by the provin@@ cial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the Rep@@ or@@ ter , some of the repor@@ ter belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who belong to the Govern@@ or itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months from now , since the Rep@@ or@@ ter have gone into the Ber@@ gl@@ and@@ y where the drug ban@@ den de fac@@ to under control . &quot;
for the output of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has rep@@ ented on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Bru@@ ders of the former famous Box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state which focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block away from the office of the public , an kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped , or how it happened , so it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug don@@ ors and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter came out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who domin@@ ates the government &apos;s Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which domin@@ ate the whole century all political planes . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i Govern@@ ors were described for high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the Rep@@ or@@ ter , to write about previous inci@@ dents in this local , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo , Gu@@ z@@ man came to a military transition . &quot;
only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ba of Val@@ dez than the best inform@@ al source on the ab@@ duction .
&quot; formerly we had known what happens , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and sticker that are devoted to the mur@@ der of journalists , because the employees have become a little what she had never expected : acti@@ vi@@ sts in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez s@@ app@@ ed a few signs and went out in the next morning for a demonstration because of another journ@@ alist to the office of the nation@@ ality .
Salvador Ad@@ ame dis@@ appeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a bur@@ nt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists all over the country have become journalists in organized prot@@ ests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries because of and constructions .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez mod@@ ul@@ ged R@@ ami@@ rez the authorities , journalists and bring them to the truth because they have said the truth . &quot;
she has since then asked that she was once again divided by the government because they are concerned that their wo@@ ut has been in@@ ju@@ red their obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeated that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , which are involved in the governmental organisations involved and an equal society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ or@@ ter may not only be killed by drug makers , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , which thre@@ aded with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media &quot; &quot; Hy@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico dies you , because they want the mouth available , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a ab@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ getting the death of the blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a notice , which was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ computer and head@@ phones in addition to their separated head .
&quot; some stores have chosen as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , according to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Cor@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
&quot; others do continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 . &quot;
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z was directed publicly on the cover cart@@ els with a tail on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are flown out of their own states or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
and sometimes they are indi@@ cted by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
&quot; for those who want to stay back and the work , it is a daily dance with risk choices . &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra who wanted to be used to be po@@ et that the drug is fri@@ ght@@ ened him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became repor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; by mid@@ night on last Friday , when the last edition was already completed , sa@@ wing the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce on the citizen in front of the office and tran@@ ken beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ s . &quot;
a series of shooting with band &apos;s riv@@ age and security forces in the vicinity of the beach Maz@@ atl@@ an had had 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ate further as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the bal@@ do@@ ce you have released the news on the website by Rio@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ med he@@ aled near to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police , the re@@ ven@@ ge kept to see if they were in willingness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the Fo@@ unders of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Rio@@ do@@ ce his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you even remember it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if the same day , who has been mur@@ dered by the J@@ avier , the practic@@ ant me asked for reporting to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to stim@@ ulate his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue when also a fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; now researchers have found researchers , that the first findings of the unbeliev@@ able N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ters were so well received that experts have been described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good preserved that they could even determine that his po@@ dium skin of red@@ dish Brown was - and they said , they could have something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; refers to him as &quot; the imm@@ ort@@ ant din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r spec@@ imen of the world . &quot;
&quot; the Fos@@ si@@ l is a newly discovered way of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the circulation time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; blo@@ om &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mored her@@ e@@ ater the best preserved Fos@@ si@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , as he on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium Mine in the vicinity of Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that appeared from the se@@ aled rock in the pl@@ ague , and decided to look at more detail . &quot;
he discovered by him Fos@@ si@@ l was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ontology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground@@ ing pen@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; after all of this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it sle@@ pt , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will come into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant en@@ vor@@ es , although he was covered with a arm@@ ament , and a conver@@ tible perf@@ umes that is probably threat@@ ened by meat @-@ din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mored din@@ osau@@ rs used to hide a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide from rob@@ bers , and used a shiel@@ ding technology , which is used as counter@@ fei@@ ting , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to do his enemies , experts , which indicates that it was threat@@ ened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has done in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ontology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild beast and there Bor@@ ough op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineers Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing maintenance of the copy made by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ our on his body . &quot;
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ades , a widespread defence method in the animal , which means that the tip of the cre@@ atures was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ shad@@ ow@@ ing is common , the results are surpris@@ ingly , since the size of Bor@@ ough op@@ el@@ ta is by far the living animals survi@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; it pointed out that the din@@ osau@@ rs had enough pressure due to flesh , din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs was justified by the evolution of confront@@ ation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ afts - think of R@@ ehe , Z@@ ebr@@ as or Gür@@ m@@ amm@@ als - are much smaller and hur@@ t as lo@@ ot , what sign@@ alized that these no@@ dos@@ es was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong rob@@ ber@@ tier behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mored din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous to have been the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ m@@ amm@@ als of the cir@@ cuits , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis organiz@@ er connections in its sk@@ alen also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ brown was .
&quot; scientists continue to investig@@ ate the animal to know about his life , including his constant int@@ ensity to figure out what it has e@@ aten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , into a river and out into the sea , where he went on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as south , today , and rivers and oc@@ eans would probably spread much more land@@ ed than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because he is fully covered with conventional skin , but also in three dimensions remains and ret@@ ains the original form of the zo@@ di@@ es . &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early circle .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it . if you just want a little with the eyes sh@@ iel@@ ds , you could almost believe that he is at the sleep . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ alk was a time , when giant ther@@ opo@@ lies , me@@ at@@ able din@@ osau@@ rs , which went through two legs , the earth were raised . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ derland op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mored din@@ osau@@ rs was ge@@ ared from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ sters . &quot;
the scientists whose latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology will believe that Bor@@ derland op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea was condem@@ ned and in mu@@ d .
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , as he on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium Mine in the vicinity of Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the pre@@ aching Din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the Schn@@ au@@ ze to hips . &quot;
the cre@@ atures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips , which was carried by its shoul@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mored her@@ e@@ aters was curved through the western Canada , until a flo@@ o@@ ded river it was flo@@ o@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater re@@ vers@@ al of the din@@ osau@@ rs did his arm@@ ament in exquisite item Show detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied super@@ re@@ ste of this special spec@@ im@@ ens are so well preserved that the hood is still hol@@ d@@ able flat@@ s along the din@@ osau@@ rs
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of maintenance is as much as a profit in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I h@@ ehe , the conf@@ use it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied resi@@ du@@ cts of the skin still cover the hol@@ est tank @-@ plates , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
his right breast@@ plate lies on his side , his five fing@@ ers are up@@ ward according to top . &quot;
I can count the shed on his sole .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass fac@@ onn@@ age on A8 : many closure
f@@ ier@@ ce accident on Thurs@@ days evening on the A8 road : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass fac@@ onn@@ age bol@@ ts .
&quot; there are numerous sc@@ ents , mile @-@ long stone and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) are in@@ ju@@ red around 20 people in the late Thurs@@ day@@ .
&quot; according to the first information of the police were against 17.00 , between the connecting Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ age of 30 cars , including probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; about the exact number of the latter , there is no information before . &quot;
it is to be light up to medium @-@ heavy injury , said a polic@@ emen . &quot;
a large open @-@ offer of lif@@ ebo@@ ards was at the acci@@ dents .
the A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the map of Munich a ten kilometers long resi@@ dency were formed .
&quot; as an AZ repor@@ ter , it came also on the counter @-@ road to massive disability - by numerous g@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
the fire@@ works not@@ ated the mark@@ ings of the vehicle &apos;s vehicles which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a.m. , a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was a coll@@ ision between a Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a car . &quot;
a bail@@ i@@ ber was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced time : nothing is sitting on the train and sle@@ eps .
or you is deeper into his work and has just a gen@@ ius thoughts .
and then : exhau@@ st .
&quot; comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an un@@ gentle , or h@@ ap@@ es the chassis in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
Ther@@ mal@@ k@@ ur .
but times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are soon past .
the German rail@@ ways are currently the perfect drive @-@ box .
it is easy to be confirmed by mobile phone that you could be taken with his seat and therefore post@@ pon@@ ed the ticket .
currently there is a test operation on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we offer it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the year on many other long @-@ circuit routes in Germany , &quot; said a train . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is called by train the chassis @-@ card &quot; &quot; without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the use , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what do you want to do most of the guests .
&quot; you have to also bought it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is why anyway the most convenient way of ticket . &quot;
and last one needs a seat reserve .
&quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one is increasing in the train , calling his card under &quot; &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test is then a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the tr@@ aders get a message on their mobile devices a message that travels X has been taken on the train and the bak@@ ed seat Y .
comes the tr@@ actor in the box of the box on seat Y white he that s@@ its there a passenger with already un@@ anim@@ ated online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to work , further , further . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which should take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without Tick@@ et@@ us control by our tr@@ ap personnel , the DB navig@@ ates itself in the DB navig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; this enables drivers to shape their travel time on the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , Marketing offic@@ on , marketing management board . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train goes , white , that next to del@@ ays , and hidden bre@@ eders to the biggest cu@@ sto@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; because often one has even , in any case , but one of the fellow travellers do not send all documents that you need for the validation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either if the credit card or human resources are missing or otherwise a document , which one has to prove it . &quot;
&quot; the result are end@@ less discussions between tr@@ aders and chassis , which leads to poor mood in the evenings or large space and del@@ ays in controlling the own tickets and the avi@@ ation at the end of time takes to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of Test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this also only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw@@ numbers on the same route are not yet activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; W@@ aver Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after they had arrived in New York City , swe@@ at the bed of a Air@@ b@@ nb apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
you proud about a post by someone from high school .
&quot; the police has just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , and called it there . &quot;
&quot; conf@@ used , because nobody else had the information posted on their fe@@ ed , closed them Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on its Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ year , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon . , killed live . &quot;
he po@@ ste@@ te a picture of brow@@ ns living body that was stret@@ ched on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at itself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her mobile phone later on the evening to twe@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and fol@@ ds , cri@@ ed , and by a man who claims , brow@@ n@@ n father , who was a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they wat@@ ched a live @-@ Fe@@ ed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ y dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , in@@ sured another polic@@ eman and cri@@ tic : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , re@@ minded fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of mur@@ der that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and which we can call it typical .
at this moment I felt sh@@ aken .
I was an@@ gry and we@@ pt . &quot;
you book a flight back and went home on the next day .
after the land@@ ing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two in the next morning would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; W@@ ash Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cin@@ em@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss of loss , strength and resistance , which is living in the community and the streets are filled to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter , which took a flower , and a suitable crown contributed to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two one conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; re@@ minded them about what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go now to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have a 18 @-@ year boys and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and it must be seen and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to be free to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have good luck to give her an experience in which she is personally experienced by ec@@ ular rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would consider her a bad service to keep it away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ is@@ sant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a settlement on the possible non @-@ indi@@ ct@@ ment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there are Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected to a local business owner , the lunch made . &quot;
they provide po@@ ckets before and hal@@ ting them to pass on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to take a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rell appearance .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed following the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health @-@ health in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in the organis@@ ing . &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her camer@@ aman Lu@@ cas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ si only wanted to document what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; you want to document or tries to find a story that you can benefit ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from past@@ ure - in a community that benef@@ ited from its pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; as fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , and have grown up their votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist out of the field , which is known for its acti@@ vis@@ m rum , which is known for its acti@@ vis@@ akt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought by Fer@@ rell the project closer , together with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; &quot; W@@ aver Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns creation . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not som@@ eb@@ ody who speaks for us or speak with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main watch for me how these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is not about a Messi@@ ah leaders , but in order to come together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be found as the most revealed participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; W@@ aver Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as she loves himself and their woman mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ gh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that it must be in this work , and in the release of black people have to give a certain infr@@ ing@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history had the role of black sw@@ elled women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founder of the movement , which according to the k@@ illing of the Black Teen@@ ag@@ ers Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , weak@@ ly women in leaders have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
black , weak@@ ly women have to bear the main load of everything . &quot;
follow @-@ up to notice that the movement is really kept by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it consists of that &quot; this no af@@ fir@@ mati@@ ver type of action is &quot; &quot; at Fer@@ rell because of their identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who did this energy , she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no co@@ inci@@ dence , although it was at for@@ efr@@ ont front , because in a life on these cru@@ ises than a black , sw@@ ule woman so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the new@@ sletters for F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have gone long gone , but the raci@@ al connections between the church and the police are still persi@@ stent . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is to mal@@ nutrition for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ing of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area they call her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she s@@ amm@@ ed to a voc@@ als and she feels like this memory , since then she went over three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - besides our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; siz@@ ing &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss over bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people although it is not yet built .
&quot; but the idea of a shopping center at the south of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents . &quot;
cold leaves the theme hardly any .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would really be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a human &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ alls ) or completely simple : &quot; &quot; sc@@ ent Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates that a gallery draws more customers to the city , which also profit from the remaining shops , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; add : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peas@@ ant market hall is available , in the 13 Direct market . &quot;
with the beginning of the construction work will be the end .
the Gallery of Mach@@ er want to integrate a mark@@ hall in the new building - namely for the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside sitting .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been buying a week in the farm@@ hall for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of farmers always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ed in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
this is likely to likely be low in the new project but not exactly low . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what &apos;s shopping in bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether gar@@ ments , shoes , dru@@ g@@ e- or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
of which there is enough in our city .
one can see how many retail stores here are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even one proper mid@@ market , it is more important that us remains at least the mark@@ hall remains at least . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ purely in@@ expensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , shop stores are rented in a shopping center only of larger companies , because the dor@@ ers are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , speci@@ alty stores there are almost no more and what it is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a mark@@ hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farm@@ market market during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also on the duration if the bit @-@ gallery will actually come .
or creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit Gallery already previously to distribute the businesses from bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , also requires no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peas@@ ant market hall gi@@ b it thanks to the wa@@ hn@@ ous many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in bit@@ burg no place more .
&quot; when the peas@@ ants market is cap@@ tured , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost un@@ notic@@ eable over the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ser and Haar@@ s@@ itten were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sch@@ ick@@ ed the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year im@@ prison@@ ed diplomatic news on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , A Be@@ coming res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline have turned their professional competence in technology , computer sciences and art , and teams , whose condem@@ nation was converted from Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ m analysis of the DNA that could be extr@@ acted by Mann@@ ing , if someone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the in@@ harder determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already talked about identification as a woman , in 2013 because of 20 charges were sent@@ enced , including six violations of the spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer @-@ ams and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo there - a gra@@ b , black @-@ white be@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is obvious or a plat@@ in@@ able per@@ ch - with which it was associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Str@@ anger visions &apos; .
&quot; ther@@ ein the artist &apos;s portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ens@@ ic arti@@ facts , such as cigar@@ ett@@ t@@ um@@ mel and gu@@ m , by extr@@ acted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a time of time .
&quot; they brought an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time , and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and their insp@@ ected M@@ use were to un@@ equal bri@@ des that inter@@ change@@ over in the course of two years of letters .
&quot; they even film@@ ed one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed images , which would be a future predict@@ able in which the president of Chel@@ ten@@ dencies would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only few days , after the book was released , Mann@@ ing Frei@@ sing to seven brut@@ al years ago in Kan@@ sas , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is now also at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp has per@@ forms a war against inform@@ ants from the government @-@ bearing and against sex troops in order to fix the rigi@@ d sp@@ elling , which he actually should fix , continue to fl@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things consist of a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its over@@ large sub@@ title among them ( that &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is an end of &quot; &quot; automatic bl@@ asting , whose foundation of sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA @-@ Sequ@@ ence - a thousand of C@@ s and GS and As , in a pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed by demonstr@@ ating the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , just like amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully continue to take care of who we are and how are open gene@@ tic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ective them , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ Werk of 2007 , Trav@@ ious Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is preserved in an own room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as they are working with a free @-@ speaking part in the hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they com@@ pose your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so I never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist , which gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I am still getting a ge@@ aring , if I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing did not see the exhibition - as it was pre@@ ached in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations that gather like hormon@@ es of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their gene@@ tic h@@ ap@@ logical groups have been written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement who formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also thre@@ aded behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ urses and an employee of the University of Oxford because of kill@@ ings
a nation@@ wide man hunt is a professor at the North@@ west University and a staff at the University of Oxford who had seen as sus@@ pic@@ ious after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fat@@ al violations .

&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published war@@ n@@ atives , that the body was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple inj@@ uries at his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ectives into the pen@@ s as mur@@ der while police are actively searching for both sus@@ pic@@ ion , said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the North@@ west University .
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em will now be rep@@ aired and passed by the campus of the campus of the North@@ west University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a pun@@ legal matter which is investig@@ ated by the competent authorities and the North@@ sen University cooperate with this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spok@@ es@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that we are in touch with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help the U.S. authorities .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he presented themselves .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he demand@@ ed the sus@@ pic@@ ion on the authorities to ask the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a vision of their residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help you find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building managed by the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just got a mysterious tip , who is exactly what happened in the apartment of 1008 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very gr@@ ated .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it was un@@ clear if the inci@@ dent took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by safety cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the timeline and the background of the victim , and expl@@ ores a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible content . &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) to restore Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko he contains nothing , which could give rise to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list named criteria however , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities reported the reported findings of the W@@ ada approved by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to be able to publicly accept D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation by since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system an error was launched . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit something which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day there were S@@ mir@@ nov problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeat@@ edly told that the report contains cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ fied positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report of un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the execution of d@@ op@@ ing@@ controlled in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;

&quot; in front of the use of technology for monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and fast@@ ing the company with re@@ curr@@ ing fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which became the whole capital on $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; audi@@ ts , $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , who shows that today &apos;s employees work more than ever before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only assign@@ ments .
the staff want to have the feeling that you accept and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that feel their voices , and that work you &apos;re worth to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employee Experience at LinkedIn that used both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach ren@@ di@@ ts when their portfolio companies are well running . companies are working well if employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the Analytics Tools third parties promise , dedication and commitment of the employees , it is not a mir@@ acle that you can find support . &quot;
the data on the employees is important to the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company cannot take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company as@@ ks employees after your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that change on the path is . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ appointments and appropri@@ ating dem@@ oti@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,@@ 000 suggestions , you have to have ready to have 4,@@ 000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen himself too much on the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; because if you do not follow the employees , &quot; Hab@@ t ye really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and whom you do not care about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , which per@@ forms a monthly staff Sur@@ veys , was able to pay action on the same day when a problem will be reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ win . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organise and adding multiple teams within the company and add a communication training for the problems within the company . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company receives more new insights about the staff , and hopes that on long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector , which is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose men , you lose also customers . &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA is elimin@@ ated the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the break
it goes on 23 clock to enter@@ tain a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercises .
some have moved their tri@@ k@@ oto@@ ves and show the back full of silence from the first day of training .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ ain minutes a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses are returning after the thir@@ st@@ ful exercise to their final exercise before they will return at 6 : 30 pm to the water@@ man Foot@@ ball Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ days @-@ exercises to facilitate the burden of players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA around 19 : 15 am beginning to meet the fully packed time of the player . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day that post@@ pon@@ ed the break of the camp@@ s almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game period in West@@ wood practical exercises .
&quot; they should hold in the course of August 18 Ex@@ ercis@@ es , 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CAA , even if they add the multip@@ lication of the player to another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days to them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply put it , she pl@@ aint themselves , they are great people . &quot;
I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time it will really be great .
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , what given the clear sight@@ ings of its fields marked by an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which is already thro@@ wn with foot@@ b@@ aric class that will be a protective net behind a go@@ d@@ est sp@@ atial , no light task . &quot;
&quot; br@@ ins @-@ players should occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ atial that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people can rent there a room and then set it there to be a exercise . &quot;
if you have the Vide@@ ob@@ and of an exercise it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on the parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big worried .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook aims to send more potential articles with Fal@@ sch@@ amp on invo@@ ices of third parties and their results in the original project , &quot; said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts , so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine metho@@ d@@ ologies , and to send them to Fak@@ al test , which may display the results of the results check out of the original articles . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been cri@@ tic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe they also influenced the US pres@@ idential elections 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French vot@@ ers have been disp@@ uted in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan , following social media networks , if there were not succeed , rep@@ ented post@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of new facts review . &quot;
&quot; besides the realization , what stories of Fak@@ als are challeng@@ ed dram@@ atically parties , people want more context to understand what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product@@ manag@@ erin for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; you added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; and to other changes in his messages fe@@ ed to decrease incorrect news . &quot;
creation of a Com@@ ic @-@ Romans : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a g@@ p@@ flo@@ ch .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of its cozy place in the Cab@@ l River valley in K@@ ent , and now is an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ y Yor@@ k@@ um with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand of someone who has been dead since 300 years , he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; stret@@ ches the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families who were illustr@@ ated in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustr@@ ated by another , next British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on a archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ De@@ ad Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emoti@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , that was written by a double @-@ day in the 1700 &apos;s , he worked for the Jaco@@ b@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb ! &quot;
and letters are always after smoke , because then there is a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the sm@@ ell has an effect , as if he also himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for som@@ eb@@ ody who is so connected with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; &quot; U@@ m honest@@ ly &quot; ) , this seems to be nice to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vikt@@ ori@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and the many treasures and cur@@ iosity of the castle , such as the mon@@ ast@@ ed Hy@@ men@@ tions are spent at the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with farmers , garden@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then he d@@ rank he &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write .
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes a decade later met , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &apos; Oh , wir@@ ing it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; day books , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent , who were looking , &quot; &quot; said Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke to fight for two families . &quot;
guys , let go all his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to discover in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who re@@ built the newly built castle , in order to join the farm the farm . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a re@@ bel@@ lion that entered in this book with the title &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm was started in this area and I thought , a re@@ volt was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly root@@ ed in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ ite pat@@ ron , who hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , represented in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century is represented by his own bur@@ ial by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery , which was born only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favour@@ ite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ l@@ ens seemed to be mis@@ sed , getting back debt and make money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men prov@@ oked their shoul@@ ders , by taking rich old women . I imagine them as a ho@@ ops good guys in front , with a talent to adver@@ tise . &quot;
after the end of his operation at the castle is Rhodes in search of other unique treasures experiences
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness of a Com@@ ic Roman on El@@ äm@@ än@@ ws , the grounds of a san@@ atori@@ ums of the early 20th century , which has been returned from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad , to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; ach , now I have to be done again with the ver@@ dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the en@@ velop@@ e of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started its campaign to launch a new roof ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
&quot; still to Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nel@@ son Art@@ z will hold the logo and the s@@ logan . &quot;
at the end of August it should be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on her yesterday free website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make sure that man@@ ches better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm con@@ vic@@ tion that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attr@@ activ@@ eness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a s@@ logan , it is called on . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able all @-@ setting . &quot;
finally she stand in competition with other municipalities .
&quot; a middle five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the city of Bad Hon@@ nef , its new roof and the campaign cost . &quot;
military form@@ ations in Turkey - er@@ do@@ gans of fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es to Ankara by the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on P@@ ensi@@ on@@ ations and tran@@ sports in the Official Res@@ ps .
so this week .
at first sight a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish dispute , a year after the Putin &apos;s test . &quot;
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the general stab@@ s , as earlier , but in the office of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to discussions under the Presidency of the government now also the five Vice @-@ president , as well as the Minister of Defense , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
with this they were the civ@@ ilians in the Y@@ AS in the transi@@ tions .
the government is moving in the military the bre@@ wing .
&quot; general stab@@ sch@@ ef Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the He@@ ar , the air stri@@ pe and the Nav@@ y were ab@@ used . &quot;
since the failed cou@@ p has been classi@@ fied Erd@@ ogan 169 of 326 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to the movement of the ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as a wire driver of the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who have been involved in Putin , which has been involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the Putin had Erd@@ ogan the over@@ throw @-@ test as &quot; &quot; divine &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but does Erd@@ ogan the army really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February the paper &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; un@@ lock &quot; &quot; in the military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; in general , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ought among other things in the lifting of the head of the head of Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the paper . &quot;
the big part of the army and the security forces is at least further .
&quot; in the middle of July Erd@@ ogan &apos;s further 73@@ 95 sover@@ eig@@ ers , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it seemed to be used as Erd@@ ogan the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als presented earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times she stim@@ ulate them on their role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the mund@@ ane state .
&quot; according to his election in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan Erd@@ ogan the power of the military &apos;s step by step back , not least by calling upon the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former offic@@ ers say , Erd@@ ogan is targeted an anti @-@ Islam@@ isation of armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned a well not gen@@ ius offic@@ er , who sought after putting fear of persecution in asylum , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; meets this , such development could not leave the N@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is in the alliance after the inf@@ ants of doubt about the help@@ fulness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immig@@ rant plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees the leg@@ ged immig@@ rants on 5@@ 0.000 per year to lower , more str@@ ing@@ ent regulations for the slow@@ ing of Visa for a temporary staff permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill ought to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , wages and increase billi@@ ons of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the US to change the manner as the citizens from other countries of green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new review procedure will speak the candidates who speak English , who will have the financial resources to help themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to quali@@ fy course for racing trade
over the past few months the future of the race @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been disp@@ uted again - now it is quite quick to go .
&quot; before the end of the year , at the end of the year , on which the tourist buses will be built , built . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the race @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to details of the transport of transport still in this year construction work on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ steig continues to order and capture the country on this especially for tourism important connection , &quot; stated traffic secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the route is aimed at about 2.5 million euros .
from this amount the country is 75 percent .
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will now be final , stated S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Ministry and the South of South Africa as its operators are already one of the technical details already .
&quot; with this , the roadmap to negoti@@ ated the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that enables the race @-@ to @-@ shuttle to be ordered by the Renn@@ steig @-@ Shuttle in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ steig @-@ Shuttle is an especially popular with tourists popular railway connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ steig .
&quot; during the past months , in the course of a pilot has been tested , whether the route is used by plenty of many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also in parts powerful .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought , that it cannot be crazy a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
yes .
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their climb seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eyes of the robot , its shape of the nipp@@ le , and the type of F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny but the companies deliver lots of them , and we will still get much more frequently to see , Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ ppen have developed by their inf@@ latable partners with a sil@@ icon that feels warm an@@ ew - with consci@@ ously human reactions to be achieved through the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adapt his robot according to his beli@@ efs &quot; &quot; and select everything , from the eyes of the robot to the type or color of his fing@@ erti@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturb@@ ing , since many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; possess , which would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ woman . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ ppen have developed to robot@@ ic with a silic@@ one .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robots , it allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appe@@ aling such as sh@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and then there are still the True Compan@@ ion developed pro@@ xy gold sex robots with pre @-@ programm@@ ed person@@ alities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of tim@@ idity and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ xy gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; weak@@ est the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; something like you like what you like , and it does not like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
she also has its existence in the course of the day - like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturb@@ ing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they will replace genuine human relationships , but the subj@@ ected to rap@@ e , if one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : res@@ ign@@ er@@ ende ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ tranquil one most . &quot;
on his website True Compan@@ ion pro@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a vibration why men do not have any pro@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , this sex robots are not just a boy or even just one other sex@@ ually . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement , refer to a little dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to a withdrawal from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R ex@@ emp@@ t their increasing popularity , they are nevertheless pro@@ visi@@ onal at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what from the outskirts , can prev@@ ail in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational . &quot;
and many people are not strange or besi@@ eged to them the free market for this permission .
&quot; however , there is a certain sur@@ pass that these highly developed sex robots abo@@ und in which the rights of women are threat@@ ened in which the rights of women are threat@@ ened in the White House , who has pre@@ c@@ ated women sex@@ ually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ err@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical images , the s@@ worn body and the st@@ olen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
the Republic of Gilead is a le@@ ap but at the moment this does not feel like a big le@@ ap .
the goal behind these sex robot consists of an physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
your Con@@ struct@@ ors want to make them human being able to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have a placement or background , nothing , which could be hin@@ dered on independence or anything , which could be disturb@@ ing the fantas@@ y total submission . &quot;
other words : you are f@@ ake sl@@ aves .
or to express it in the reproduction of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ m@@ ps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ concei@@ ved of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bin@@ ary certainty of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era that the political divisions , who have pol@@ ari@@ zed the US @-@ weighing pol@@ ari@@ zed , also families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with the Hor@@ ror by Tru@@ mp choos@@ es relative .
we disp@@ ose us all suppos@@ edly to leave our filter@@ bl@@ ets .
&quot; have been noticed , the power of Tru@@ m@@ ps have been assigned to families . &quot;
&quot; I consider this because my co@@ us@@ ine , a lin@@ ks@@ gr@@ ated Di@@ chter@@ in who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
it re@@ minded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the re@@ publi@@ ci@@ ous relatives with which she had f@@ ought for decades , suddenly and completely intr@@ insi@@ cally on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it falls into another connection that this also involves considerable risks associated with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the adju@@ sting effect of his Presidency has the power to move all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ illing way that us will no longer be rep@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still fri@@ ght@@ er long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can@@ er of the right wing &quot; norm@@ aliz@@ es &quot; that suddenly appears compared to its standards as an in@@ concei@@ ved of embarrass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ance , the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least knew , like his tax declaration ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp is indeed one than very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be healthy to quali@@ fy as im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my co@@ us@@ ine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ nation &apos;s parks , and the best three dollars , which can be found in the city , if you have no caff@@ eine needs . &quot;
the horses are enormous large , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the co@@ low@@ ns are k@@ nur@@ rig and the animals turning to look at full fear of their own shoul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ster and the climate @-@ going music convey@@ s this in strange way .
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ ens of a city ap@@ point : views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; fifth years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the topic @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a great round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Carousel is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ year , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all had a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily no one did afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % tips . the same - this to buy something about the cargo . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but also exercise pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the buy @-@ house was ap@@ ologi@@ an gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I made the experience , you get my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast pain from prison into hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us will leave the prison for a hospital visit to the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his hand , which he suffered from pris@@ oner authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what you need to know now
how exactly is the software update instead ?
do you have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the waste management of cars of the em@@ ission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are taken from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe returns :
is the new action comp@@ uls@@ ory ?
no , the tr@@ aded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the comp@@ uls@@ ory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ mel@@ software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the driv@@ eway @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the makers have announced an efficient implementation in the next months but not yet to be called an exact date .
&quot; Daim@@ ler has communic@@ ated , every person affected . &quot;
&quot; if any in@@ spec@@ tions can be charged , it will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long should the con@@ stra@@ ints take a total of things ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; said S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the relations from the commitment of the manufacturer , as well as of political pressure . &quot;
&quot; for we have seen , volunt@@ arily act on the car producers in the topic of environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could last in the garage only three to four hours .
&quot; time @-@ en@@ velop@@ e , it may be to get an appointment . &quot;
&quot; what do mot@@ ori@@ sts do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the A@@ ce is waiting for waiting .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would draw up as S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive awar@@ ding of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fe@@ ared .
&quot; but in the regions , where driving is threat@@ ened . &quot;
in rural areas there has so far no values for older diesel .

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland w@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , going next year in R@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; however , the location is already written - the most suitable applic@@ ants are proj@@ ected . &quot;
since 31 years she is w@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
&quot; and the work makes it still great fun , as he convey@@ s in the pressing meeting . &quot;
&quot; he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for its success@@ ors . &quot;
at the same time wonder@@ ed him that so far no application has the requirements of application .
the city looks for the next time an architect or building engine@@ er .
so - under cont@@ emp@@ t of regular canc@@ ers - still enough time for a revision .
da Has@@ lach for the administrative community as a sub@@ project regulatory authority has to refer to the applic@@ ants .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill out these no more , the citizens would have to go to consultation until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but Ci@@ tiz@@ ens is important to the city and him self , says w@@ acker , who tells of a good company li@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
over 30 years in office some major projects have collected to the w@@ acker with pride .
&quot; we make the city of living , he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the defe@@ ated parking place around . &quot;
the chin @-@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the st@@ adi@@ on@@ ance is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it correctly &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates w@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ ori@@ ous be available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister big play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction and garden@@ er can be flexi@@ bly respon@@ ded to many of it .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of the green zones will be commen@@ ced by citizens and visitors often . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye to do what rein@@ forced &quot; &quot; when re@@ constructions are approved , emphas@@ ises the divi@@ dend city . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears a high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is buil@@ ders , &quot; at the end everything goes here over my table . &quot;
&quot; for taking care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( low @-@ construction ) has been for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , wishes to w@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good business , but also for the further creation of the city . &quot;
&quot; who , Roland w@@ acker Jack wants to refer to information about the city Has@@ lach a complete studies as an diplom@@ a or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction legislation . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stand high and low @-@ construction , construction planning , management of urban li@@ vest@@ ments , urban oper@@ atives with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei as well as sub @-@ laws authority including monuments . &quot;
bike on wir@@ es are thro@@ wn : south @-@ track
&quot; according to the police , the blue @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ors had the blue bike of the railway cross @-@ crossing in the section of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so heav@@ ily damaged to the her@@ ent of her@@ ent goods .
the medi@@ ators come from two male offen@@ ders and are looking for the night@@ time after them .
near the Tat@@ ort had been observed by witnesses a rock @-@ sco@@ oter and a bike ri@@ ders .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ b@@ ben@@ e@@ forth , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the or perpet@@ rat@@ ors had itself in great danger and also endanger@@ ed the train .
&quot; apart from the damage to the L@@ ok and the system as well as the del@@ ays , and the cost of rail@@ road transport may also take advantage of the rail customers to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; overall , be carried out by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed in the morning morning , the railway transport on the south @-@ route could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten person@@ ages were fallen in the morning , two of them were the long road traffic . &quot;
&quot; of goods fell , but they did not delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to ex@@ changed around 200 metres of bottom . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red flesh , milk products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory Dar@@ mer@@ disease ) to lin@@ t &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based prot@@ est and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory int@@ est@@ inal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ cur@@ able state , which in the US around 1,@@ 3 million and in the UK 300@@ .000 affects , causing Mag@@ enk@@ r@@ amps and blo@@ cking , re@@ curr@@ ing or blo@@ ody ap@@ ert@@ ure , weight loss and extreme f@@ atigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person usually come out , meat and dairy products to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ington@@ er University out that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop immune cells that foster a toler@@ ant Dar@@ m . &quot;
&quot; conduct@@ ing researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells at Dar@@ m pat@@ rou@@ il@@ ing to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food not into the body . &quot;
cells that are able to per@@ mis@@ sible in@@ flamm@@ ation of cells are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue .
&quot; if the balance is too far towards the flamm@@ ation , it may result in a in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory int@@ oler@@ ance . &quot;
in experim@@ ents has been established that a kind of tolerance and immun@@ og@@ ging immune cell in m@@ ice comes to bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their intervention .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the Dar@@ m micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the m@@ ice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i , and an in Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ toler@@ ant diet toler@@ ant , less in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory int@@ est@@ ates , if the same system also encour@@ aged men . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doct@@ oral bar@@ rag@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an signed a kind of immun@@ og@@ ram , which under@@ took tolerance than that a group of study re@@ ws such cells had , but another group of the same tribe that was separated , but it was not separated . &quot;
you susp@@ ected that the difference with the int@@ est@@ om@@ es of the m@@ ice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mush@@ room that normally live in the stomach @-@ Dar@@ m . &quot;
the col@@ oration of the m@@ ice were found DNA @-@ sequ@@ ences and there were six bacter@@ ial species found in the m@@ ice with the immune cells but without them missing with the m@@ ice missing .
&quot; M@@ ice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ en environment so that they were missing micro@@ bi@@ om , and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria react to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i have to grow in an liquid and then exc@@ eeded small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from the m@@ ice . &quot;
the immune cells have developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it proved to be a tri@@ bal product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ k acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers dou@@ bles the amount of te@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of the m@@ ice , increased the number of such cells by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ op@@ ause were semi @-@ known , san@@ k the number of cells around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as m@@ ice and that most of us can protect us in our stomach @-@ int@@ est@@ inal tr@@ aders .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ ro@@ ds from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells at people like at m@@ ice , but def@@ ects were found in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , in people with in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory int@@ est@@ inal disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote that these cells control in@@ flamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the int@@ est@@ ine . &quot;
potenti@@ ally can lead high te@@ yp@@ pot in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an expansion of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; Gen@@ ius &quot; has committed
&quot; at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; signed , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wedn@@ es@@ days his deb@@ ut had its deb@@ ut against Samp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the U@@ EF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder roll , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic was however excluded from the P@@ repar@@ ation Asia @-@ Tour of blues , and made only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho got to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides M@@ atic started also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ kak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ St@@ adion , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent un@@ folding in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho has yet another new comp@@ uls@@ ory des@@ ir@@ able , but he insi@@ sted that the club already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; , &quot; three of his four pre@@ dominant new comp@@ uls@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thanks to the association , he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;

new fro@@ zen for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind but the wind turns out : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel nor SPD leader was the first @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin .
&quot; merely no stor@@ ing from the party central , just no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so loud as the most important wish of the election . &quot;
since Martin Schulz leads the party since Martin Schulz has changed .
since then the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt &apos;s house watch the events of the SPD @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing disposal the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated provin@@ cial cities .
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ wind was not described in the approach . &quot;
there were dep@@ ths .
and this one after the others .
the Bun@@ des CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Niedersachsen a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions by SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply be mist@@ aken , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editors of the editorial team ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fr@@ action of a green MEPs bro@@ ke the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is de@@ posed to a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the day , his red @-@ green co@@ alition won their red @-@ green co@@ alition with the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ liga leader Michael Kell@@ ner has requested the ab@@ ra@@ inf@@ ant ra@@ inf@@ ant El@@ ke T@@ ks are called to return her mandate .
the transmission to the CD@@ U means a clear dis@@ appointment of the weighing .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ires must immediately give her mandate to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ or and election of the Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ at@@ ernity Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; but that may not be true , however , se@@ pul@@ ated a SPD elect@@ or@@ ate , than in the morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ s reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Niedersachsen , stands after the transition of the green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without own ruling majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary point of a whole rows of large and small crises in SPD state .
and no one knows what is coming next .
the mis@@ ery started with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ ms the com@@ rad@@ es time . &quot;
&quot; according to the land@@ owners in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Bavaria @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then also - and indeed everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the di@@ m@@ bling , the Düsseldorf @-@ pl@@ ei@@ te Haute the party is smooth . &quot;
the com@@ rad@@ es to the com@@ rad@@ es in the weeks after that again .
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next draft .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD land@@ s@@ ef , lost on that weekend his N@@ im@@ bus , because he burned in the Alsace , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he made in the crisis @-@ communication , after that pretty much everything made wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
since then the wood &apos;s fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ Ab@@ gas@@ aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board of Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Prime Minister has been in cri@@ tic@@ ised in criticism .
ten@@ ese sur@@ vey@@ ed came .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just , W@@ eil tried to put W@@ eil in the past weeks ever stronger , in the covenant acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the aspir@@ ation of the former citizen of Hannover , to build its power in Berlin , also the com@@ rad@@ es in the environment of Martin Schulz was not hidden . &quot;
they left him because they spoke of salvation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; in doing so , W@@ eil meets the part@@ ying internal Zw@@ ingen@@ berg is not at fault any gu@@ ilt . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; thus , the com@@ rad@@ es will therefore endeav@@ or to keep up their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; your wr@@ ath is aimed at the countryside , and here mainly on the ab@@ stain@@ ed parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ bear@@ able and democratic , as Ms T@@ ires their own career to eat on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ ers@@ ch , Chief of the Party @-@ Bundestag , the Edi@@ torial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ires is not elected because of their person as a director , but via the country of the Dutch Gre@@ ens into the Parliament , so the ra@@ inf@@ ant @-@ level . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Opp@@ er@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , search@@ ed a &quot; und@@ em@@ ocratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the weighing awak@@ ens four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan W@@ eil for Prime Minister , &quot; says Opp@@ er@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a nickname in the Bundestag on the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now pass the personal career of a future CD@@ U , &quot; said O@@ er@@ mann &quot; , &quot; said Opp@@ er@@ mann . &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or it further escal@@ ating the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ors for the center III
who wants to san@@ e in the years of talk house I can soon get assistance from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative of the city &apos;s urban development on Wednesday in received . &quot;
at the beginning of the information seminar Sch@@ ind@@ ler was once again a looking forward to the previous event .
since 1991 it was in emp@@ ath@@ y san@@ itation areas .
&quot; back then , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Wur@@ ttemberg have taken over two thir@@ ds of the conveyor . &quot;
in the San@@ alisation II from 2005 to 2016 the allowance is still at 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are &quot; successful &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , and not only new construction areas . &quot;
on April 4 I received the information from the government of Karlsruhe the Information that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
&quot; the funding amount is 833 euros , of which birds 500 000 Euro of the country , the rest of the con@@ gregation . &quot;
how does a refurb@@ ishment is now ?
&quot; one will continue to examine so sn@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it is also a role , whether in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ e . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area may also be post@@ pon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the du@@ mp tre@@ ats on Wedn@@ es@@ days Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the content of the federal states @-@ program &quot; &quot; Social city &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal p@@ ests , improvement of living and employment and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objects , which means per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
the auth@@ orization period for the conveyor runs since 1st January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , it would only once again be performed in stock , within the scope of which the parties involved have received a ques@@ tionna@@ ire to fill out a ques@@ tionna@@ ire . &quot;

therefore the ques@@ tionnaires will be post@@ pon@@ ed to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the ques@@ tionna@@ ire is the &quot; building and real estate ad &quot; in which it is among other things about the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment .

&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; Oper@@ ator &quot; &quot; can only be filled when in the building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , it is said to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a ful@@ filling ques@@ tionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new measures are not con@@ f@@ able . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of the conveyor after the &quot; wind@@ sur@@ prises - who first comes first .
we could not reserve any convey@@ ors for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;

british invent@@ ors itself sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in the house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he enter his front door to enter his office and even with a hand@@ movement . &quot;
&quot; St@@ even North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thumb and for@@ ef@@ inger , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;

the technology res@@ em@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now built both at home and its BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers of thousands .
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine hel@@ icop@@ ters to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that the American manufacture in the last month , tax pay@@ ers according to the details of the military , which have passed the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , if the president on board was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Con@@ duct@@ ory officials of the White House made a tour of products made up of all 50 states . &quot;
the finish hel@@ icopter hel@@ icopter was exhi@@ bited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ able car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House slow@@ ed the presence of the hel@@ icopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the hel@@ icopter at the South La@@ wn Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ icopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to realize that you are aware of this , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his supervis@@ or , the dep@@ endance of its supervis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the hel@@ icopter was met at the South La@@ wn on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained , until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the depart@@ ures from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restri@@ ction of the Tu@@ t hours a second team for the flight back would require . &quot;
&quot; the original air@@ lines were during the event during the hel@@ icopter , while the safety sp@@ ers@@ onal of unity during the period remained on the ground at the plane . &quot;
the design@@ ations provided by the TIM@@ E provided was not clear whether ultimately a second aircraft was necessary .
the H@@ atch Act promises federal states to use state ownership for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event would hur@@ t the appointment .
&quot; a question that we set was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds , as if you are locked , &quot; rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty @-@ com@@ mander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political @-@ t@@ ints .
&quot; on the event , the president has an an@@ chor for the reform of health reform that was at the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to the in@@ ventions of the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ed to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo reader is unusual .
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted in February an investigation as the pres@@ idency of its first campaign in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that deci@@ des on the use of the pres@@ idential election through its pre@@ dec@@ essor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states shows , produced by American working with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty spok@@ es@@ man of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ cre@@ ations perform frequently workouts in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by to implement the US president in the White House with pre@@ precision cen@@ tim@@ eters .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event en@@ umer@@ ated at the training needs of the air@@ lines for the month , said an official time . &quot;
&quot; hel@@ icopter units , in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ pres@@ et @-@ suppor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a speaker of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in it the hel@@ icopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ ary records for the pres@@ idency , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ es of the US @-@ Def@@ ence for the fis@@ cal year 2017 , the DO@@ D annual report for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
record of unity drawing the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost for the operation of the hel@@ icopter is far below the rate .
&quot; the costs of tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on the basis of estimates for the re@@ funds , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to an Rand @-@ Study from 2015 , the re@@ funds for DO@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spok@@ es@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the hel@@ icopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I go from that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent upon them . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the hel@@ icopter and other military equipment to have worked for so many Americans un@@ ti@@ rel@@ ess .
&quot; of course , it is of course appropriate to be emphas@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether the Tru@@ mp with the hel@@ icop@@ ters interact with the hel@@ icopter of the event , but he continued his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driving force of a fire place . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp at the representative of Sik@@ or@@ sky and h@@ w with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task

the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will meet tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite after five games still un@@ imm@@ ac@@ ulate balance , the top @-@ leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
team chef Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has at least respect for opponents .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar forms . &quot;
just on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV mainly provide the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and fin@@ s can even refer on in@@ serts in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will be like always hard for us .
&quot; there , you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his deb@@ ut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment it is currently taking the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella not at the Bundes@@ liga games , the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the so far defe@@ ated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Casti@@ llo was yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ sians An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ b@@ üh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Ni@@ els Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ er Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vict@@ ories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could again turn again into the team . &quot;
&quot; enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was in January 2016 still the number one of the Juni@@ ors Wel@@ d@@ list was not , filled someone out of the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the K@@ ader . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy Donald Tru@@ mp is not , when he sat down his signature under the law for the tight@@ ening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in its H@@ ast , the law to be released , the congress did a few &quot; &quot; constitu@@ tional rules &quot; , &quot; he ret@@ ained a few &quot; &quot; constitu@@ tional rules &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as shar@@ p as expected , and even Brussels dre@@ amed against the US pres@@ cription . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European enterprises that help Rus@@ sians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , the investors of the domestic O@@ MV has been co @-@ financed with other European companies in the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ eg@@ tung Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil @-@ concert . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp itself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons stand up to him for choosing .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , which the Group could be dis@@ astro@@ us and which could really be we@@ ht@@ un . &quot;

roll of back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen equipment
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kindergart@@ ens the clock is returned to the clock .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the city of Kre@@ feld in the urban kindergart@@ ens ( kit@@ as ) again in own pec@@ uli@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ er , dep@@ uty head in the area of youth aid , this is a good message : &quot; &quot; we have made us all very happy . &quot;
cooked in addition except House : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ felder Zone 46 Kinder@@ hotel sites , in 44 the children are getting a warm meal for lunch . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ aj@@ ahr , 2800 children are growing at the tables , and the need is growing ste@@ adily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who will be looked after 45 hours of weekends , in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children will stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 participants from 1 September kitchen service : you warm up the landscap@@ ed food , supplement them around sal@@ ad , Roh@@ kost and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the meal , habit@@ ats , and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seventh facilities - deci@@ des on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen are now fixed to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; thus they are much more involved and it is easier for the kit@@ esur@@ fing , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is about healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the chef as a team is as useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the cas@@ ita , one person that is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the mam@@ ber@@ y of the K@@ ita rooms - so far as the task of the cl@@ ans - will be done in the future of special clean@@ ers .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also placed in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen also the charm that it appears in the cost comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ation and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical structure , it means from the press . &quot;
and that even though 46 part @-@ time ex@@ ecu@@ tives will be set .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the occupation area not so strong to the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;

&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said , &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win from the General Site Manager for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the labour forces work strongly on local community and large areas Glasgow , an important column for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ approval . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay@@ s and prosperity , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising life of life and the chr@@ onic production back@@ bone , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently a thri@@ ving production line at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;

has the PSG Barcelona ago three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar war@@ ns ?
the side of La Liga her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave from N@@ ey@@ mar in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after taking a offer of £ 189 million to release its release cl@@ ause , but they have war@@ ned Barcelona in front of three years before the world leader ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has lift@@ ed the trans@@ fer@@ windows in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ club is ready to break the world , with more than the double of the previous trade show , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United back . &quot;
&quot; after the end N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive players in the world and to the highly paid professional ath@@ letes of the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is an@@ gry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way forward , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans Sur@@ rection that the club has always been given his best since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
&quot; but , the football world was war@@ ned against three years ago by the same @-@ president ? &quot;
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ her@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association , who wanted to draw one of the best players of PSG . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ her@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exc@@ eeded this line with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; thus , made it clear that they could not permit the International from Italy , in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by giving them one of its prize package for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

the final report for abuse sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , speaker of the reform@@ atting &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bisch@@ of and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of Pop@@ e Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would serve to the reputation of Cath@@ olic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger to express their deep insight into their own om@@ is@@ sions or at that time , incorrect assessment of the operations . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; on the other hand cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; two measurements &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with respect to the handles in Regensburg be@@ ers no one that it would be prevent@@ ative and sh@@ am@@ eful action , so the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the hab@@ it that character@@ ise the Cath@@ olic Church as a source of all exercise , is already part of the everyday work experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion on it that is normal for normal . &quot; &quot; Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
also Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is argu@@ ed in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you like to go on the church and that &apos;s a mis@@ sed fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; furthermore it pointed out that in her youth &quot; blow@@ s a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be with nau@@ ght@@ y children , as I was one , ready to be done . &quot;
&quot; they are un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world have changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports about the abuse falls often also pap@@ st @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on .
&quot; totally to ign@@ ore , argu@@ ed author and hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pop@@ e &quot; is translated ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he wer@@ ed the results of the result . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ sei@@ ze report that presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with instruct@@ ing attorney at Ulrich Weber
&quot; in total 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility , &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually miss@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in the Final Report , there was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , so that of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was applied to many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; even at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the re@@ verse was able to fall out for the students as well . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other compl@@ ains that many victims estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even combine positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; interview in the interview E@@ z@@ emann , why the ab@@ duction Report on abuse &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion is dischar@@ ge . &quot;
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence of violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradi@@ ct@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for example , many students do its &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other he also appears as cholesterol and perf@@ ection@@ ist , the ö@@ f@@ teren hand , if a dom@@ en musi@@ cally no top performance brought . &quot;
how do you evaluate the bio@@ graph of this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front up to the rear , one has more likely to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does it happen at all . &quot;
&quot; him just eight sides , and he will clearly spoke of each susp@@ ended or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
also the violence of violence at the for@@ eig@@ ners outside of its impact .
you can re@@ ject it if cancelled too late or first announc@@ ing not seriously enough .
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ haven , on which he realized , was inv@@ ented by virtually all sur@@ veys as - so liter@@ ally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents him an excellent witness , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; was led regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and b@@ ons . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ain about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality that led even too little bre@@ asts .
&quot; that he did not only thre@@ w with chairs and bow@@ ls on the ground , but also ear @-@ ho@@ oks and all too fre@@ ez@@ ing guys to the hair or ears , he has already regre@@ t before and turned to be ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor , however , however , we have to be said that such re@@ tr@@ ages in the frag@@ ile time , the 19@@ 60@@ s and 19@@ 70@@ s , were widespread , in parents like with instruct@@ ors . &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ wing methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born from 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have the still in a world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium , experienced . &quot;
&quot; compared to what to what actually , in this report , namely in this report , namely the indisp@@ ensable sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are certainly more Bag@@ at@@ al . &quot;
&quot; as if you are looking for , if it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , so many who have never understood the him , still is dir@@ ty . &quot;
the truth but is : the report relief Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some re@@ vers@@ al or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual hydr@@ o claims to have familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never been bap@@ ti@@ led to talk with my Father or my mother , &quot; said a su@@ ffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
the true problem in enlight@@ en@@ ment of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims made of shame .
&quot; if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ eness , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , but a team of a colle@@ ague would have been a colle@@ ague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
how do you rate Dom@@ sp@@ atzen pupils R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers on the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tion@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have spoken ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had left the current findings and could have been given to the respective perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , take that it rested on him ... Bu@@ ben or clear@@ er or even more have opened , when compared with their parents , dormit@@ ory , trust . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that it is concerned about him in advance and / or its environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is un@@ expected by any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be subject to him not prevent@@ ed him or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good names with these confli@@ ct@@ ing crimes , as it is unfortunately happening in some cases . &quot;
in the media a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; to read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report &quot; &quot; way@@ view &quot; . &quot; &quot;
do he must live with this occurr@@ ence ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and ver@@ men@@ ed became a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
yet this is precisely the abuse of the reporting .
&quot; there will be clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sex@@ ually abuse and violence , as well as we say once , other pre@@ cau@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report presents inci@@ dents from time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conduct@@ or of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test results , the cases , in which Kn@@ aben from s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal teachers were regularly anim@@ ated and dis@@ assembled at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ ill@@ ful states have to be stu@@ ff@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral @-@ scr@@ atch . &quot;
&quot; on the war , like the most of the witnesses emph@@ asi@@ ze the topic &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; section . &quot;
one was only happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ dies@@ t &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ou@@ polis ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there have been a discipline , but just not a adi@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and that applies also to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even to connect them even positive memories with it . &quot;
it remains at most still the pre@@ cau@@ tions to have taken away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and responsible from the occurr@@ ing at a school , where he did not want to hear ( so the witness ) nothing to hear , and then again at 1993 . &quot;
ne@@ loss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s director , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in it , he pointed out that in the pre @-@ school , the examin@@ ations will continue practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; already given the danger of neg@@ atively pres@@ sur@@ ants , he re@@ per@@ ate dr@@ ill the entry . &quot;
&quot; this was of course a time when the legal clarity was consi@@ sted , as the test pen@@ alties in Bavaria too were b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; before that , they ex@@ propri@@ ate themselves in an legal gray area , as everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also hard to cher@@ ish him , where the people were perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ mis@@ sible border had been exc@@ eeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one can also not say , he would have always taken away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; in 1980 , the examin@@ ations in schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said , it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards of that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we hist@@ ori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate there after today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
and the princes has already been right .
&quot; however , that of course does not apply to sexual abuse who was at all times and not for what was bro@@ adly in the pre@@ school and violence against inno@@ cent chil@@ ds , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all quite hor@@ ri@@ ble and I am glad that it is finally raised .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ in@@ ation and con@@ vic@@ tion , i.e. the ear , and to pull toward hair and ears , were widespread in the 19@@ 70@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as physi@@ cally en@@ velop@@ e then has been forbidden , he also has taken care of it . &quot;
&quot; which image of his ruling time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of your tight@@ ness also came to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pop@@ e Benedi@@ k@@ ts X@@ VI@@ . , tells of his perspective , as played the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only a tri@@ but@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at no means that he led there a strict reg@@ im@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the ur@@ ge un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly be possible from the until then rather national known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen a institution of Wel@@ d@@ ough into the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one now makes no big singers and before every success stand , equal to what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
as what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well organized and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , primary , deep s@@ laughter and heart@@ ed people from which one cannot be able to allow yourself to a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ ics , regular contact to him , visit him - he is almost blind - and him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t for@@ give him until today , that he was not strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he en@@ ched their lives and attached to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ owed teacher - a hard father , certainly that may be , but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ able person , to whom they still look at the time and worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please once again quite clear : all , what one thro@@ ws to it , are re@@ pi@@ vot@@ al methods that were at that time on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is very un@@ familiar , a man , just because he prominent is and a still prominent brother to make the medi@@ al cran@@ ni@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil int@@ ent , which stands behind , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , dischar@@ ge him . &quot;
&quot; now the An@@ stood areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year man who has acquired great re@@ services , and without the outside Bay@@ ern@@ s , and perhaps Germany probably no one wants to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
