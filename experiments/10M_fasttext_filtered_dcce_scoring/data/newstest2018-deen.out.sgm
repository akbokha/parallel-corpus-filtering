<seg id="50">Civil-group-group releases ficming of Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of colored has issued a warning for colourful people who travel due to discriminatory policy and the racial attacks from the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which aims until 28 August 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianer, since travels through the state particular attention and to be expressed precaution in recent times throughout the state and here are used here in the statement of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win a discriminalization authorities and the criminal law enforcement authorities, the disproportionate on minorities, said the group, the travelling warfare, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, human beings happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are lifted because of their skin colour, they shall merge or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear discomfort in such a frequency, which we have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such a warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group zipped incidents like rassist concealed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after having had taken no fuel over the journey through the state and taken away by the police of Missouri in prison.</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also indicates a recent report by the offices of the General State of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than pasture."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>

<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would be harder to spend a company because of residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had already been adopted for Texas and Arizona, after the States immigration legislation had passed the local criminal law enforcement authorities to undertake people because of the ACLU for further Rassenprofiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but at last time you have stakeholders the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The frozen project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing law of the fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the spell of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fishing bacher CDU, together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann did first give insights into its operation, in which he 55 hectares of meadows, and 40 hectares of woods cropped, 40 milcooled and also host many young animals and houses five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Milk" is for him the alternative-market path for the milk of his cows, so swivel. "</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday guests only comes to Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-Chairman of fisher's fisher, he describes the ordination project as" "spontaneous." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not be mischievous areas in the art.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much of them can be processed with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," stressed swing. "</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he assumed the eleventual operation and generates these without any chemical plant protection and dune, even if he does not run a bio-operation. "</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" the commune has recognized the significance of the ordination of the company, and is pleased with the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope so that the insurrection of the faces could still be exposed to a whole while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and to think about how they continue to continue their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often present in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 pitches were fenced in 2013 in a total of 25 plots of eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The right-lasting surface is therefore 40 hectares that may not be consumed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total amount of 71 500 euros the half of Leader was funded, a quarter carried out the village of fisher."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers 12 610 Euro, which had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of Weifence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you make a really good job, without farmers and farmers it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also, for Peter White stood firm:" "here are best foods produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of Weidegradation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the revocation of the Black-force.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR identifiers.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area may not be in non-passable area (Hangnection over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the insurrection."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing bacher Weimar project 2018, currently the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots, which would like to build just 16 kilometres fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">The redevelopment area corresponds 35 acres, the lowed costs are more than 112 000 Euro. "</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change it is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful fall of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, did not know what he did, when he did a symbolic Axt in a hay dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of legalized immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller handle not the statue itself. "</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of bootcampers and liberty-imitators would have it arynthesis if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he writes their significance, and especially the meaning that it was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as an Miller Acosta lacks:" "I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom, which is illuminated the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is inaccurate right, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the rising words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the hassle of the poor:" your efathers, your poor, / your frighted masses who walk afterwards, freely to breathe, / the elend of your rich chicks. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" "completion" "on our screen was better to see."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller's not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict to the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - did not know that they were a high political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by being presented in an abused classical imaging representation of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem is the feminine figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she is himself a very different name: mother of the exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cop and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed, the people wanted to change from the right wing this long time. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty anybody, but rather an early neo-servative to die Welt" "Lady Liberty is progressing."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">Fackel is not supposed to be illuminated the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusually is Limbaugh here on something different.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely on a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in it, as they seen from the exhaustive, elenden, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense that the world from the perspective of people to see, the refuge are looking for and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and will to hear them.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever would like to know."</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch is not supposed to enlighten the path, but the hate that is the only source of power, ignoring."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black loded schottical members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">"Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time, as only two shallots to the team of Great Britain."</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-royal contingent in the World Championships is a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of schottic athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that in Scotland has to learn something special "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something out of it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue it, until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The schottic athletes think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - the fight against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle from the crew to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather humble.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their capitals was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were sottically, or wherever they live or practicing, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and genuine feeling, the rush of idh very naturally brought, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"Commonwealth-Silver medallists, which is at the 400-m-hurdles with the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is" incredible, that 16 shallots in the British team are. "</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"the middle-shafts Muir leads on this road and last year, five British and two European records in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another snort that you are looking for a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds of their first world Championships as the only other snotte in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the teams's capitals says that they are" tremendously "" to the fact that many of its citizens do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"this is special about team capitalists, lies that it was elected by the other members of the team, but knowing that my team will have voted for me and have chosen to me something special for me, he added it."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the shallots, who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to poetry."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a capitalists?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"therefore, it is really important to put on this homesupport and to benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block of Kritikern via Facebook: help you not to bear a public office if you cannot bear the twist of laundry.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country did something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington but it lasted not long, until the newspaper him because of all smote, from the internal policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shocked at the critique of criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for the year 1783 said Washington:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dums, and stumm we are led as the sheep for battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to the Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted which have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union condemned him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stab of the governor left the fighters as frivol, and the online comment was full of an object with" Na, and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republicious governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two daughters of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very well sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his clothes and playback his hairy head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blocking of persons who come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is considered officially referred to and by employees who are paid with public tax dollar - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans SprecherIn Amelia Chasse the acts of the Governors and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of drums or spammers, or hedge people who sail online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a priest, no troll."</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not professions. "</seg>
<seg id="184">"the priest, the Bible cited the Bible in its post and appeal to Hogans Catholic faith."</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawytin Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD., was not hill, but she asked for hassing."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite that I was disappointed that there were no reaction to hassverbreaking and other current news," wrote them in the commentary box of the message "" The Post. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people takes on the same topic position, then they will be seen by some more than such a collective collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors as" "focused spam attack" "would be other probably 'intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook-era makes it easy to cut a message by simply block a critics or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in early time, if one had done the same that employees were discharged to collect newspapers with critical reflections, and to deceive or bring the protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But precisely that happens straight digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that it is criticised that he has implied the Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is blocked by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter-Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="1818">"among the latter, its publishers and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply invented, although its presence anywhere there is - a big photo of Valdez, which indicates the façade of the Riodoce building. two Reporter in the thirties, wearing T-shirts that his smiling face with spectacles or its typical Panamahut."</seg>

<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a Sonder-nationality, in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee, has entered into the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of thousands of murders, which are linked each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely made before judgment."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce it still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are imprisoned and even though the terrain is still traitant."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting has the discussion of safety little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time in this workshop", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know that, we missed all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of the 15th of May, Valdez left the newspaper of Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">He made it just to drive a few blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla was lifted by two men. he was shot from his car and 12 times has been translated into it, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who will be translated with "" twelfth river "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">He drove away in his car away and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Scafels tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but to the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans remuneration last year and delivery to the United States in January was Sinaloa to one of the bloom battles of the country, since rivalled fractions here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it makes nothing that in Sinaloa every day somebody or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of consumed, two-story masheen for drug Queen, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'rest' if only a card control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs fores in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work was Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault in it that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, there was published in February the release of a interview recorded with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rivate card actions in the war with Guzmans Sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have been denied the sons, suspected animated bandmembers of each specimen of the output once they were delivered to Zeitungskioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was it to force Valdez not to force after the confiscation of a different paper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues participated in that he would ever be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste than he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate a journalism without regard to the smoker problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the paper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard treainable studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, nobody else to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, where ever she led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on," he said to the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to accept the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the silly.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I would not want to be asked:" what have you done in given so many Toter... why did you not say what was going on? "</seg>

<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>

<seg id="1859">"he would always sit to El Guayabo, the bar towards the office, go and always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, please ask: was his love for routine-ups?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced to ask them to ask their own shares in question, how they can do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they may not like if you live with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their beatiful start and Landebways, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-catering and self-determination."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinonists.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it smells wrong, keep it away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell is a sense that can be clocked... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Waver Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after they had arrived in New York City, sweat the bed of a Airbnb apartment that they rented and scrolled by Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">You proud about a post by someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the road, and called it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because nobody else had the information posted on their feed, closed them Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on its Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-year, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mon., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of browns living body that was stretched on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," thought Ferrell at itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her mobile phone later on the evening to tweet over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and folds, cried, and by a man who claims, brownn father, who was a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live-Feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of protesters with a belly dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, insured another policeman and critic:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual, reminded ferrell to her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shaken.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You book a flight back and went home on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock they took her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two in the next morning would drive to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Wash Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and loss of loss, strength and resistance, which is living in the community and the streets are filled to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a ferrell with her daughter, which took a flower, and a suitable crown contributed to Ferguson, the two one conversation, which they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you don't remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" reminded them about what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go now to Ferguson, because the police have a 18-year boys and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and it must be seen and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to be free to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have good luck to give her an experience in which she is personally experienced by ecular racism, it is not different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would consider her a bad service to keep it away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a settlement on the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there are Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business owner, the lunch made."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They provide pockets before and halting them to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take a new type of activism for ferrell appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed following the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health-health in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in the organising."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farsi only wanted to document what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came Ferrell in the meaning:" "you want to document or tries to find a story that you can benefit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from pasture - in a community that benefited from its pain and its resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as folayan recently stated in an interview:" we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson, and have grown up their votes and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist out of the field, which is known for its activism rum, which is known for its activisakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought by Ferrell the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of" "Waver Streets?" in the years after Browns creation. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speak with us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main watch for me how these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not about a Messiah leaders, but in order to come together," said Folayan - she proved to be found as the most revealed participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" "Waver Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves himself and their woman marries. "</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that it must be in this work, and in the release of black people have to give a certain infringability."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history had the role of black swelled women in the broader Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founder of the movement, which according to the killing of the Black Teenagers Trayby Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as swul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, weakly women in leaders have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, weakly women have to bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Follow-up to notice that the movement is really kept by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it consists of that" this no affirmativer type of action is "" at Ferrell because of their identity as a heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who did this energy, she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at forefront front, because in a life on these cruises than a black, swule woman so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the newsletters for Ferguson have gone long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police are still persistent."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is to malnutrition for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area they call her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she sammed to a vocals and she feels like this memory, since then she went over three years ago in Ferguson the road."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people although it is not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping center at the south of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the theme hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund bitburg" will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say:" this would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would really be a dream "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "does not need a human" "(Siggi Balls) or completely simple:" "scent Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates that a gallery draws more customers to the city, which also profit from the remaining shops, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"add: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market hall is available, in the 13 Direct market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery of Macher want to integrate a markhall in the new building - namely for the Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been buying a week in the farmhall for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of farmers always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">This is likely to likely be low in the new project but not exactly low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's shopping in bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether garments, shoes, druge- or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which there is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many retail stores here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even one proper midmarket, it is more important that us remains at least the markhall remains at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is obendpurely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, shop stores are rented in a shopping center only of larger companies, because the dorers are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty stores there are almost no more and what it is still left, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a markhall is not suitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmmarket market during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - also on the duration if the bit-gallery will actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates the Gespenst Bit Gallery already previously to distribute the businesses from bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, also requires no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall gib it thanks to the wahnous many - as I find - senseless construction projects in bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasants market is captured, again a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>

<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of the DNA that could be extracted by Manning, if someone can be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways, as they can be interpreted and the inharder determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>

<seg id="2132">"through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo there - a grab, black-white befie, in which Manning is obvious or a platinable perch - with which it was associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger visions'.</seg>

<seg id="2136">"they brought an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg with a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at this time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>

<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things consist of a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery, artistic statement called Manning with its overlarge subtitle among them (that" i "in her surname is an end of" "automatic blasting, whose foundation of sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>

<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped by demonstrating the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), just like amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully continue to take care of who we are and how are open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-Werk of 2007, Travious Memories, also to see. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is preserved in an own room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as they are working with a free-speaking part in the hand from the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria react to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri have to grow in an liquid and then exceeded small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells have developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified out of the liquid, it proved to be a tribal product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-Milk acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubles the amount of teyptophan in the forage of the mice, increased the number of such cells by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptopopause were semi-known, sank the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us can protect us in our stomach-intestinal traders.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-rods from L. reuteri can develop the cells at people like at mice, but defects were found in relation to Tryptophan, in people with inflammatory intestinal disease."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of the Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reformatting" "We are Church," declared by the former Regensburger Bischof and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year's brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve to the reputation of Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger to express their deep insight into their own omissions or at that time, incorrect assessment of the operations."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano "" on the other hand criticized that in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen with "" two measurements "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with respect to the handles in Regensburg beers no one that it would be preventative and shameful action, so the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit that characterise the Catholic Church as a source of all exercise, is already part of the everyday work experience and prepares the public opinion on it that is normal for normal." "Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis argued in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go on the church and that's a missed frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"furthermore it pointed out that in her youth" blows a very normal educational means "" to be with naughty children, as I was one, ready to be done. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to use today's standards for past decades, because the world have changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse falls often also papst-brother Georg Ratzinger on.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to ignore, argued author and historians Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "is translated (in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he wered the results of the result. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-seize report that presented by the Bistum Regensburg with instructing attorney at Ulrich Weber</seg>
<seg id="2904">"in total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and early 1990s" with high plausibility, "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually missable."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the Final Report, there was said to Georg Ratzinger from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, so that of Domkapellmeister R. was applied to many cases of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even at high Emotionality, the reverse was able to fall out for the students as well."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other complains that many victims estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even combine positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"interview in the interview Ezemann, why the abduction Report on abuse" "Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion is discharge."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence of violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for example, many students do its" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other he also appears as cholesterol and perfectionist, the öfteren hand, if a domen musically no top performance brought."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate the biograph of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front up to the rear, one has more likely to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger does it happen at all. "</seg>
<seg id="2914">"him just eight sides, and he will clearly spoke of each suspended or complicity in the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence at the foreigners outside of its impact.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can reject it if cancelled too late or first announcing not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenghaven, on which he realized, was invented by virtually all surveys as - so literally -" salvation "," heaven "and" better world "." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents him an excellent witness," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely", "" sincerely "," "" sincerely "," "was led regularly with cakes, biscuits and bons."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complain about its perfectionism and its high Emotionality that led even too little breasts.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only threw with chairs and bowls on the ground, but also ear-hooks and all too freezing guys to the hair or ears, he has already regret before and turned to be apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honor, however, however, we have to be said that such retrages in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, in parents like with instructors."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such brewing methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born from 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have the still in a worldly school, a state Gymnasium, experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what to what actually, in this report, namely in this report, namely the indispensable sexual abuse and the non-violence at the pre-school, are certainly more Bagatal."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as if you are looking for, if it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, so many who have never understood the him, still is dirty."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth but is: the report relief Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some reversal or complicity in terms of sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual hydro claims to have familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never been baptiled to talk with my Father or my mother," said a sufferers for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in enlightenment of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims made of shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and sibleness, then certainly not a choral manager, but a team of a colleague would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate Domspatzen pupils Ratzingers on the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have spoken (Georg Ratzinger) could have had left the current findings and could have been given to the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, take that it rested on him... Buben or clearer or even more have opened, when compared with their parents, dormitory, trust."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that it is concerned about him in advance and / or its environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the study. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is unexpected by any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be subject to him not prevented him or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good names with these conflicting crimes, as it is unfortunately happening in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "non-violence" to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report" "wayview". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he must live with this occurrence?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and vermened became a huge melange from sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2949">Yet this is precisely the abuse of the reporting.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there will be clean separately: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexually abuse and violence, as well as we say once, other precautions."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report presents incidents from time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductor of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test results, the cases, in which Knaben from sadistical teachers were regularly animated and disassembled at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skillful states have to be stuffed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral-scratch."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the war, like the most of the witnesses emphasize the topic" "Vorschule" "section."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradiest" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengoupolis?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there have been a discipline, but just not a adistic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and that applies also to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even to connect them even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">It remains at most still the precautions to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and responsible from the occurring at a school, where he did not want to hear (so the witness) nothing to hear, and then again at 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Neloss Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzinger's director, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in it, he pointed out that in the pre-school, the examinations will continue practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already given the danger of negatively pressurants, he reperate drill the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course a time when the legal clarity was consisted, as the test penalties in Bavaria too were banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they expropriate themselves in an legal gray area, as everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also hard to cherish him, where the people were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one can also not say, he would have always taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"in 1980, the examinations in schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards of that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger to evaluate there after today's moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">And the princes has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"however, that of course does not apply to sexual abuse who was at all times and not for what was broadly in the preschool and violence against innocent childs, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally raised.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplination and conviction, i.e. the ear, and to pull toward hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physically envelope then has been forbidden, he also has taken care of it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image of his ruling time has Georg Ratzinger, for talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of your tightness also came to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, as played the Domspatzen only a tributary."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at no means that he led there a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without the urge unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible from the until then rather national known Regensburger Domspatzen a institution of Weldough into the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with Keksen and Bonbons alone, one now makes no big singers and before every success stand, equal to what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger during the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really very well organized and over again as wonderful, humorous, primary, deep slaughter and hearted people from which one cannot be able to allow yourself to a fly. "</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emics, regular contact to him, visit him - he is almost blind - and him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who don't forgive him until today, that he was not strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today that he enched their lives and attached to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, vowed teacher - a hard father, certainly that may be, but also a lovable respectable person, to whom they still look at the time and worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please once again quite clear: all, what one throws to it, are repivotal methods that were at that time on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is very unfamiliar, a man, just because he prominent is and a still prominent brother to make the medial crannick."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent, which stands behind, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, discharge him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the Anstood areas would have acquired a 93-year man who has acquired great reservices, and without the outside Bayerns, and perhaps Germany probably no one wants to know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
