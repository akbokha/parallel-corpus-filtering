Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
&quot; at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes re@@ minded of the horses at their celebrations , they hunt at the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the feed rates . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career was again and again .
on Saturday was the best golf@@ ers of all times - 101 tournament cr@@ ad@@ le - again near horses .
he left himself up with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV on a horse .
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and therefore at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convin@@ cing .
the German Sp@@ orth@@ aired to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a little Gala the Gol@@ den@@ e Sport@@ pyram@@ id .
in awards the lack of an sympath@@ etic ath@@ letes do not .
&quot; Bundes@@ liga , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ enn@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has drawn him already .
long is the 18th prize winners of the Sport@@ pyram@@ id .
in Aachen he met the first prize winners Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me much &quot; , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sports success , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the off@@ spring .
and so he also gave the prize @-@ fee of 25.@@ 000 Euro .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men received the two @-@ fold US Mast@@ ers@@ winner on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; among the excellent belong the light@@ ath@@ letes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ ner Eber@@ hard N@@ illes , the Ru@@ ner Peter Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ break Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard . &quot;
many of these sport leg@@ ends were on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part I emig@@ rated the most sight@@ ed company into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ m@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and trade agreements T@@ TP - that wish both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US pres@@ idential competitors , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental approach . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a princi@@ pl@@ ed , rather phil@@ osoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
&quot; the , on the role of the state . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt in doubt that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ations .
Clinton oil the economy at death and regul@@ ate , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different , claims tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will drive regul@@ ating solid , and he makes for a wide @-@ reaching controllers with lower taxes , strong - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is said : the state has certain tasks to comply with specific tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich increases , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very near to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the shots , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost liter@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic applic@@ ant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot;
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rej@@ ected by the State of the State of Republi@@ can@@ als .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp could also be partial debates in Tru@@ mp . &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp is to build co@@ il @-@ power plants and driving the coal power in the USA .
oil @-@ promotion shall also be possible to termin@@ ate the Paris climate trade agreement in so far as far as possible .
&quot; in the contrary , Clinton wants to build the renewable energy programme and calls for a country : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of energy and millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the com@@ memor@@ ative trade agreements , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US would not want to isol@@ ate international trade and not just protect American jobs . &quot;
the should then be paid for even better than Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum level , he says , he is likely to be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on one side , Tru@@ mp , who wants to dischar@@ ge the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his cri@@ tics are holding him so that the bud@@ get@@ ary defic@@ it would be even bigger .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton is at least demand that they pay more taxes , and their cri@@ tics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every aspect of woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who are linked themselves to everyday life .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often sad . &quot;
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he scar@@ es with big eyes cur@@ ious in the space .
his mother died on the table .
until they remember that they are observed .
it smil@@ ed shortly and kis@@ sed the cl@@ one .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is enrich@@ ment of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid ground in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the escape . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oul@@ try .
they live in Mün@@ chner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ ed accommodations for all@@ eged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January the establishment has made up together with Pro Famil@@ ia and the Mün@@ chner &apos;s liberation .
&quot; un@@ far , it has been officially opened . &quot;
60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - not as visitors .
the exception is a vig@@ or in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who come here , has done on her flight experiences with sex@@ ually violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men escape because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they are tort@@ ure or death because their families want them to send them as Hop@@ n@@ ung@@ ers to Europe , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
&quot; among women wei@@ gh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves , because they do not see any other way . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ orary , s@@ la@@ very or forced @-@ pro@@ stitution . &quot;
it is pus@@ hing it away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that locks for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act , is not rar@@ ity &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they ank@@ ees in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , the standing women in refuge@@ e quot@@ ations are often regarded as min@@ al and worst circumstances . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women who are living in the apartment in Mün@@ chner North , s@@ adly , are estimated . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certain not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; or she met not , openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help , there is more accommodations just for them , called B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria are the seven District architecture for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; to the question , whether they were of a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , answer some with no . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is something in the shel@@ ters of governments not .
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spok@@ es@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some common accommodation floors or separate houses only for all the women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; also calls for women in the European Parliament that women have to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lack@@ ing the privacy or men , women and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can come to - for@@ tw@@ ing violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women sense of this protection can be felt , one can prev@@ ail over the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has spoken out that there is us , we have a long waiting form , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily set a second house .
assi@@ stan@@ ts disp@@ utes : demands for new employment measures
&quot; Deputy of assi@@ stan@@ ts have been inv@@ oked their union , new employment measures with regard to their disp@@ utes concerning a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doct@@ ors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demand@@ ed its entire Council from early September more work measures .
J@@ DC said that the ministers had am@@ ended on the wor@@ ries of the contract .
assi@@ stan@@ ts and medi@@ tations pres@@ idents met in July about the rej@@ ection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was ref@@ used by 58 % of its members which helped the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter , the president of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court that the government was de@@ clin@@ ed quiet &apos; to have problems that the contract was rej@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC Executive Board to complete the proposed new contract completely re@@ ject and official re@@ hear@@ ings are worried about all circumstances . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has placed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A , in order to start a further programme of escal@@ ating work measures , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes have led to that assi@@ stan@@ ts of this year sixth dispute , the first total deaths in the history of the NH@@ S . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to rej@@ ection of the agreed contract conditions which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A Members during the sessions , which were still taken before the vote by 54.@@ 000 assistant cians and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ances , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote said the health sm@@ ini@@ ster Jer@@ emy Hunt , that the Treaty establishing for doctors in England would be introduced in part . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external ro@@ ds &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announ@@ ce the hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of eight months to pro@@ claim the war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin his Turkish counter@@ s in the Gil@@ ded hall of the St. Peters@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot wo@@ und@@ ed myself to the inv@@ ali@@ cks that Ankara is to most wants to reconc@@ iliation this reconc@@ iliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ held , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile prev@@ ail@@ ed , and he radi@@ ated hardly heat , even for his res@@ et conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , they spoke repeated by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it more .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but it can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper that Erd@@ ogan would have been done so it would never be something narrow . &quot;
it seemed to me the opposite of enthusiasm .
&quot; but one of Putin out@@ radi@@ ant , sustainable c@@ aster showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his obj@@ ections : the committee of a Russian struggle of struggle on the Sy@@ rian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ e .
Putin participated in and acc@@ used Ankara to be in the back .
that was even bigger than it was committed by a fat@@ al friend .
&quot; the v@@ etr@@ al will re@@ build up again , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state of controlled media led a f@@ ier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack to Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed to be the Tur@@ ks for all the bl@@ ame .
&quot; at serious , the exc@@ uses of suffering officials that could have benef@@ ited own family from the illegal oil trading in territories Sy@@ ri@@ ens that could be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he wat@@ ched this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg was the official message that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally this meeting took place only because Putin was received by the President Erd@@ ogan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ ogan is needed primarily all the friends who can get after the last month at a sin@@ ted co@@ up co@@ up almost his ministry .
repeti@@ tive terror@@ ist attacks against Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there is also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
in Russia member states will be facilit@@ ated and char@@ ter@@ ates will be reli@@ eved when the flights will be res@@ um@@ ed .
they are counting on a delay on a delay in the Mediterranean .
this week pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tiz@@ ed the state television port@@ ed fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian import@@ ed again .
&quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is an@@ gry to the West since it is respon@@ ding to the tried and weak response as a weak answer .
&quot; to this , the continued gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ vot@@ ion is to move out from the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the west . &quot;
the Russian state @-@ chief won in Ankara with safety a bonus that he called for the for@@ efr@@ ont of state @-@ up support for the selected co@@ operative organs .
this is a matter of Moscow well @-@ suff@@ iciency of self @-@ understanding that even has a deep @-@ se@@ ated fear of Reg@@ im@@ e@@ e.de .
&quot; the summit meeting in this g@@ loss palace by the sea made it Russia and Turkey , one , as it was once described above , &quot; Alliance of external sei@@ ze , &quot; &quot; Alliance of external sei@@ ze and to feel poor@@ ly treated and in s@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconc@@ iliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey needs to be united . &quot;
&quot; it could be ques@@ tioned that after nearly three hours of first , both pres@@ idents met on the press conference that they had not even strip@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey promises to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emph@@ asi@@ ze them . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus that where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open enemies , and given the potenti@@ als for a perfect dis@@ asters , as NATO member Turkey the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et Ab@@ sh@@ oss - it certainly is better that the two leaders are at least talk together . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the stamp should be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to the For@@ re@@ ef of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand r@@ bs were connected with the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
the Bank has since then dis@@ soci@@ ated himself when they had to be saved almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; in this time , brand brand@@ ing &quot; r@@ bs &quot; is used to protect other end @-@ consumer goods . &quot;
they supported the international sport with Million Po@@ unds of sponsor@@ ing from the Si@@ x Nations Rugby to W@@ im@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
&quot; but now she decided to look , more national brands in the focus . &quot;
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alized head@@ quarter and the stock exchange to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during an visits of customers and employees in Inver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B will be at our investors , as well as the brand , where our employees will be busy , since we will now be more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank became a global brand , r@@ bs became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say , now we have no global targets , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands to customers .
&quot; r@@ bs has already stated that it will no longer be continued his si@@ x Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ tions of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the Bank of brands , because as we focus on the interior ( we have wonder@@ ed ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ ch@@ ef . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ically when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers , and these marks had dram@@ atically . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can again create these marks again , therefore I think that the time has come . &quot;

Russia Putin feu@@ dal Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly his Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the eng@@ est trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old became a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; in an opinion of the cre@@ ml , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; the dism@@ is@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as chairman of the Russian president . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been nominated since 2012 Ivan@@ ov Deputy , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
1972 born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn he made his conclusion at the renowned state of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ ml it is ( in Russian ) that he was later protocol and short@@ com@@ ics of the ruling party .
&quot; about his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government , your activity as a state of law enforcement and controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV stations on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked for it to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the ridi@@ cul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the eng@@ est trust of Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he works for Soviet sec@@ uring service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as a Stab@@ sch@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men rec@@ essed that the Stab@@ sch@@ ef is back@@ ed on their own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smil@@ es for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a sort of power supply ?
this knows no one .
&quot; but the official argument - that a man who was once applied as a potential president , at once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to large sc@@ ep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , gave me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ain Po@@ sten four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian president for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Def@@ ence .

Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ du@@ kt - what means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; that is the completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weigh@@ s 30.@@ 000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 bow@@ ls . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; economic centre Kei@@ th Brown in the construction site today was a visit and was one of the first , which went out from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbo@@ lic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering experience of a truly ep@@ ic size in this project with over 30.@@ 000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bus between the Vi@@ a@@ du@@ kt and the Br@@ ücken@@ deck is a hot activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , nearly 79 % of the total power @-@ pri@@ cks are at her place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks , today in Ros@@ y@@ th , is now ready for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be removed from the bridge to his place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struct@@ ors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant mil@@ estone project . &quot;
at this fantastic project the closure of trend@@ setting and low@@ ing @-@ building .
&quot; after installation of the last street , and its connection to the expansion of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by fir@@ es the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger@@ brücke 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hom@@ k@@ le activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ a@@ du@@ kt 222 metres long is , about 6.@@ 000 tons of weigh@@ s and had to be drag@@ ged in a slo@@ pe of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; swing , since the toler@@ ances that works to the team , tiny - on each side they were only some milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .

&quot; fortunately the strong winds made the boat already except its reach , until we left water , he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and found at a bo@@ ever without lif@@ esp@@ an . &quot;
they came all on board the coast of the coast and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ ards .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; the three men were thro@@ wn into the waters have luck in@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;

heavy hur@@ t - man sti@@ ched on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and heavy hur@@ t .
&quot; as the police yesterday evening , the 50 @-@ year had to get the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alco@@ holi@@ c perpet@@ rat@@ ors of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he stood twice on them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hur@@ t on the hand and at the body .
the police could take the offen@@ ders .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year , the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend were destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ arm@@ oured out of his sister .
together with their habit@@ ants wanted the 45 @-@ year @-@ old their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
for this reason she went out of their lives from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ situation of the man .
&quot; when the two women saw the apartment again , created the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is no @-@ silent holiday flat@@ s ?
the SPD and Green my : investors should be increased much stronger in the duty .
how does one react to the bad news that you will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD propos@@ es to the next rounds of a &quot; &quot; hand @-@ concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but shr@@ u@@ bs is programm@@ ed .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually build ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; we are engaged with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , it has to prove to be 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock market . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute point in the city hall is however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to build with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing program , which will cost millions of expenses and must be financed , should provide incen@@ tives for incen@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left is still har@@ ing hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , as Brat@@ man , finding a tight@@ ening of the situation on the market @-@ market . &quot;
the concept concept will be implemented and will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely different : for around 1260 new apartments , which should be re@@ built . &quot;
but how is the loss of other approximately 1300 apartments resulting from their promotion over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ing speaker speaker at Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; besides , we would have to be thought out , apartments again back to your price . &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke of the problem solve the problem .
in the West@@ stadt run for the ye@@ arly dead@@ lines .
around 1800 apartments there could be back to the price for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this is the owner , the housing of housing . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social apartments in the western town is raised again , one can walk from the goal of the so called &apos; inter@@ ference . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few cities shall not be able to give it any more . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even motion in the discussion .
&quot; fr@@ action pres@@ et Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke , &quot; : &quot; for a wide majority must be the CD@@ U with the boat . &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth@@ while . &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage children and child can no longer go outside , but rather it prefer to spend their leisure time to star@@ fish on the screen , was sent@@ enced in the last decade of many . &quot;
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go it is about to pick people from the sofa and be active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the television , then on video games and last on smart@@ phones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities cannot be ex@@ clude each other .
&quot; I consider myself naturally on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , one app that were created on characters in characters ( later , it was created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ern ( later , it was created a time series , play cards and other spin @-@ Off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phen@@ om@@ ena of Pop@@ culture san@@ k the interest in front of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand that the server was over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon , Go more users as t@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the player with their smart@@ phones after outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been pursu@@ ed with a GPS as soon as they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( over a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; cap@@ tured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation , which played the game as she was still younger , closed to the tooth and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that lays the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35.@@ 000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently with that within two days of market launch of the game , the number of succ@@ eeded people who spend every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays with Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for power au@@ ction .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take a 30 minute time to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; &quot; and &quot; every day to be active &quot; &quot; walk on pig@@ eon ears , because many public messages are boring and people coming to people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to be attri@@ but@@ ed to cancer or depression . &quot;
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open air to make them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covers - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close to hunting even new friends .
&quot; as usual , there are also m@@ ür@@ rical players who always need to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should &apos;s ?
it has taken a break@@ through .
&quot; even if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit already were able to follow our activity , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its matur@@ ity and the use will be done with the time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activity will be combined in the real world and assist many people on hunting are active , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ jump@@ ing title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .

&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual America , which wins a multi @-@ jump@@ ing title , and overall the fifth , while keeping their reputation to be the best of their generation or even ever . &quot;
they bro@@ ke out in te@@ ars when their age was shown and her long journey was found at this moment an end .
this success represents them into the same League like unique ath@@ letes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps that brought their sports types to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has domin@@ antly domin@@ ates the last three years , 15 World Championships - including 10 Gold@@ medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ fication of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on from her said that she is the best tur@@ ner@@ ve that I ever had seen . &quot;
&quot; it anticip@@ ated a last review in Brazil , a contest , which was not so much between bal@@ es and the rest of ath@@ letes , but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will return as a dis@@ appointment . &quot;

&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the de@@ adly attacks since a decade and heard in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot at 12 June during the car during a trip , said the authorities . &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of eight shots from a hand@@ ler weapon , while he stood on the passenger &apos;s side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police have been shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold mur@@ der did not seem to be the result of a cater@@ pillar , since the att@@ acker did not have the towels , or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who found itself in possession of an adult sacri@@ fic@@ es . &quot;

&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ zep@@ pel@@ ie : &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old likes Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto das S@@ ingen , Toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his al@@ ter@@ ror has Ed@@ mund micro@@ concept , the result of a gene@@ tic disorder , about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I was not . &quot;
I was not .
I was@@ n &apos;t left me .
&quot; what was not true -- of course you left upon it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was informed that Ed@@ mund they can never recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors went even so far that they sm@@ ote him to institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a sal@@ ary .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ ash up to his third years and he still cannot speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and bicycle ride .
he loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the string @-@ language , which is Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; Please tell me something before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a tongue , told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
micro @-@ concept has a variety of causes : gene@@ tic as for Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses like Mas@@ ern or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forec@@ asts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus in@@ corporation .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto remin@@ ds of the emoti@@ onal price of an un@@ aware future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they do not know it really .
&quot; I have no longer asked for a long time after the pro@@ gn@@ osis because I do not expect someone can really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful Council for M@@ üt@@ ter of Sä@@ ug@@ lingen with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls pier@@ ced , &quot; survi@@ ved shooting in Philadelphia
&quot; the police share that the 6 @-@ year Jun@@ ge in Philadelphia was shot , this week was already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identi@@ fied him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown several vulner@@ abilities bur@@ dens , including in the l@@ end , b@@ ein , arm and bell@@ y , but that he was at his transport into the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has made a lot of be@@ aten , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z radio . &quot;
I cannot believe that .
the condition of the boys was classi@@ fied in a hospital in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared the transmitter with that he is expected to be back again .
he should have the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also shot three men : two at the age of 29 , and a 32 @-@ year @-@ year . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reported the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims not found himself in the car and the police are determined whether one of the most recent men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be found .
Er@@ mitt@@ ler shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it apparently came to a cru@@ el between multiple recei@@ vers .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ m@@ wax@@ ed , who were trac@@ ed to various assault ri@@ ver@@ ts , over@@ looked the fact . &quot;
it seems that it is clear to negoti@@ ate a serious fight .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the case , found h@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; thus , it seems to have been here several armed fight@@ ers who were involved very actively involved , shared polic@@ eman Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
it came to no firm@@ ation and the police currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video .
on Tuesday a further 6 @-@ year girl met by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et at the arm as they played before her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane .
you recover@@ ed and the police are still looking for a sus@@ pic@@ ious .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need &quot;
that is what I present to me under the Frauen@@ olymp@@ ic name in the tower and that of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have since 1984 at every summer Olymp@@ ics and the US were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second@@ ly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which insp@@ ire for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ oli@@ kin is , abr@@ asive , makes every proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has the black and his@@ pan@@ ic presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the female tur@@ ner@@ ves was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year was Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is demonstr@@ ating strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inn@@ erin and America ju@@ bel@@ te .
&quot; now the world was able to be a witness of the unbeliev@@ able power of the triple World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they un@@ expected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual America , which won in an individual multi @-@ way event for women Gold . &quot;
Mann@@ er@@ member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but they are not seeing in the whole country . &quot;
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison one to create it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ans have only four tur@@ ner@@ ves within the crew . also , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like tur@@ nen for a very expensive sport and Tur@@ ner are primarily associated with private trainers who will be sustain@@ ed for training - , initi@@ ation , itinerary and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list will be able to continue . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in a prosper@@ ous appearance that can support business .
in those who receive the Tur@@ ner their entire training and this is for families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term engagement .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both their ath@@ letes have been practic@@ ed since then they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we need to insp@@ ire the municipalities of countless , young girls , which are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a ch@@ ris@@ er and easier accessible turn@@ tables . &quot;
I have established my Turn@@ it@@ ement of 20 years .
&quot; for my events we have free and affordable tur@@ nen in Harlem , for over 15.@@ 000 urban young people ( especially black and his@@ pan@@ ic ) offered and national and international winner . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) exp@@ ands to offer the youth high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns to earn the opportunity to learn from this great olymp@@ ic sport art and benefit .
&quot; Tur@@ n develops strength , flexibility and coordination of the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness of the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for education and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls get to interest for the tower and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic Mann@@ or@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , f@@ ass her so many young girl with different back@@ grounds , to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assi@@ stan@@ ts would like to organize other stri@@ kes after they have rej@@ ected Jer@@ emy H@@ unts suggestion
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37.@@ 000 assistant cians , who agreed upon a choice of election . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans have been revealed to introduce the treaty and said that the NH@@ S would be harmful to a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and every further del@@ ays for employees and patients . &quot;
the first assistant cians should receive a new treaty which contains changes to night@@ - and weekends working to improve the care of tremend@@ ous movements .
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ tees for Assi@@ stan@@ ts , last night in a communication with : &quot; assi@@ stan@@ ts have taken to the proposed treaty as before serious concerns , in particular , that there will be the current availability crisis and it ad@@ mit to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at just eight weeks , the remaining group of doctors under the new treaty must be made progress and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes due to discussions about the dispute over the government on the with@@ ers and sometimes on the w@@ af@@ ting of silence .
&quot; the happened of a promise that Jer@@ emy Hunt had made this last month about it , that his door would always be revealed . &quot;
&quot; Jer@@ emy Hunt must now act now , to lift up the condition and to speak the wor@@ r@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; should he do not do this , so have the assi@@ stan@@ ts have clearly made that they are willing to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an essay of nearly 13.@@ 000 Rout@@ ine@@ ations and 100,000 appointments , since n@@ urses and specialists were included in order to give physi@@ cians at the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through a acceptance of the reform of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to be better for the 54.@@ 000 assistance for the 54.@@ 000 assi@@ stan@@ ts , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General direc@@ tives of NH@@ S employees , called the assi@@ stan@@ ts to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labor measures achieved nothing of only little , past@@ es , however already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing care and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months we have spoken to the com@@ mit@@ age of assi@@ stan@@ ts , and with the health sm@@ in@@ ist@@ erium , as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es respon@@ ded to the concerns regarding the insur@@ rection and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as transfer , flexibility in training courses , training courses , and the gender @-@ specific pay@@ ers in medicine - a sign for those who want to comply with the Health Education England and the Health Ministry concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication that can reduce the heart @-@ arc@@ tic risk
thousands of heart infections are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ pro Tag drug which was recommended after the authorities to submit this more people for a longer period of time .
the inn@@ am@@ em@@ men@@ de medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for persons with a dis@@ cer@@ ation .
&quot; the drug is planned for 12 months long after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke should be reduced or another heart . &quot;
the regul@@ ating authority de N@@ ICE of the NH@@ S has recommended for a four years long to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ating authority de N@@ ICE of the NH@@ S has recommended for a four years long to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart infection and stroke will be caused by the collections of fatty material in the Ar@@ ter@@ ial fir@@ es .
&quot; if the Bel@@ ts are apart , it can cause blood flow to hide the blood flow to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood circulation , it can flow it flow through the blood flow and flow of blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another risk . &quot;
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk that makes the formation of blo@@ od@@ ly un@@ likely power . &quot;
&quot; the preparation of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommen@@ ds a 12 @-@ mon@@ ary intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary schools have a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack , or a stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ed consequences . &quot;
the fear of a ren@@ ew heart disease can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of other cardi@@ ac and stroke of people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to expand the therapies for thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the Con@@ duct@@ ance was recommen@@ ds no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes elect@@ or@@ ding in Muslim parts
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was last year on settlement of a government report because of corruption made from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that wide @-@ common elect@@ or in Muslim coun@@ cill@@ ors will be ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ation of government today revealed .
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es g@@ rei@@ ft Verbal the police , elect@@ or@@ ant and Rath@@ ers to have ignored the evidence of elect@@ oral abuse due to eth@@ in@@ sensitive and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and commun@@ al government , which now is an imp@@ ulse @-@ cor@@ rupt , said that the in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation from religious moti@@ ves so bad would be allowed to set off the police out of elect@@ or@@ ate w@@ rist@@ bands out of elect@@ or@@ ate vot@@ ers . &quot;
he recommen@@ ds that vot@@ ers should lead to prove with elections to prove their identity .
at the moment a vot@@ ers must call its name and address .
&quot; the report propos@@ es , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they give up their elect@@ oral voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community materials and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ edi@@ tees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this serves not only against the election , but should also the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader cor@@ rupt and financial culture culture that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets leg@@ sk@@ and@@ als in Eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special op@@ al court decided that the am@@ ended may@@ ors of Lut@@ sk for a Lit@@ an@@ ei to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministers should be revealed . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rach@@ man could per@@ forms the religious feelings of its Muslim fashion , and that he would have had his cri@@ tics with R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ schul@@ te . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man , &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led to its campaign on the basis that it is the fer@@ ous duty of Muslims , to vote him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either mean@@ ing@@ ful or the result of a re@@ fr@@ aming when one person is chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that it would be found in the whole country of evidence for frau@@ d .
&quot; he expressed in particular , particularly al@@ arm@@ ing to the che@@ ating stamp - in the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to browse the elect@@ oral system including the filling out to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulner@@ able minorities was ex@@ ert@@ ed , especially women and young people to vote in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ an@@ chol@@ t background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; super@@ abilities regarding the eth@@ ical and religion would be ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations from around the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political acti@@ vi@@ sts can be edit , to stop &quot; &quot; elect@@ oral &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report that is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registr@@ ations to prevent that the elect@@ oral directory to Im@@ mig@@ r@@ ational and social bet@@ ru@@ gs@@ purposes is used . &quot;
&quot; options to consider , vot@@ ers before the election according to your account . &quot;
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as they gave their voice to prevent that someone will el@@ ect twice . &quot;
systematic ex@@ ams of the nation@@ ality of a person perform to ensure that they are justified .
a three @-@ year limit upon applications to an automatic mail@@ ing code .
pro@@ hibition that political acti@@ vi@@ sts complete letters and rel@@ ocation of letter elections .
the police have give the auth@@ orization to set off @-@ ups .
a bill change that facilit@@ ates an indi@@ ct@@ ment for in@@ tim@@ ation according to the re@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law ( 1983 ) .
photograph in elect@@ oral stations .
requirement that only English in the elect@@ oral stations may be used ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees are normally put that vot@@ ers alone go into the elect@@ or@@ ance .
Sir Eric is falling over the Metro@@ politan police and finds it &apos; amazing &apos; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets case no criminal off@@ ences was placed .
&quot; the election , Lut@@ fur has explained and his dep@@ uty for due to a lit@@ ers to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices than unt@@ ou@@ ched , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was announced due to a number of reasons for submission - according to the high requirements in the pen@@ alty process - gu@@ il@@ ty .
he also cri@@ tic@@ ised the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controlled &quot; of the elect@@ or@@ ations of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets was a War@@ ning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of the parli@@ aments , a cle@@ aring heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and per@@ mis@@ er@@ ation of elect@@ or@@ ming and lamp of some authorities threat@@ ened this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; he is a ben@@ e@@ ath cand@@ le , so I see the probably as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ is@@ ons since London 2012 this year is undoubtedly part of the center : the sincer@@ ely simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick H@@ arri@@ s .

&quot; the Bu@@ yer did not know where they should h@@ ins@@ ect , when a woman attr@@ acted their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to w@@ ished the situation , mu@@ ster@@ ed them , as they looked at it , pul@@ led them out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had been under@@ lined the underwear and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales rank , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the ji@@ b , made their own pants and pants and tast@@ ed them . &quot;
&quot; she tried not even to find a somewhat discre@@ te place to do it - they just stood there , fre@@ k like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone died , when they moved the under@@ pants that you have obviously not fallen , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; they recover@@ ed the same with three further under@@ pants before they finally decided that you fell nothing , and turned out again and out . &quot;
&quot; it seemed to disturb@@ ing it not to disturb@@ ing that they would be watching - or about the person , which would buy under circumstances the under@@ pants had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How res@@ em@@ ingly think that someone had shel@@ tered with home , which had a different person and which were not wash@@ ed . &quot;

a bri@@ tic trav@@ eller inter@@ rupted its immune system and saus@@ ages of a serious examination - by following some of the dir@@ ty and ek@@ el@@ iness of Europe .
&quot; the moderator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k Sh@@ ab@@ te his refu@@ ge on a euro @-@ circuit , a joints on Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Circus , a Flus@@ hing of a draw@@ bar and a public phone in Russia , to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ati to show itself and show us what he will let itself . &quot;
&quot; but the experim@@ ent , which was film@@ ed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , , brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the Flus@@ hing of a draw@@ bar has been used , which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually in a kitchen sp@@ ü@@ le more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical professionals over the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ ak@@ ter@@ ia as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left , what he decline , more than a bad after@@ g@@ ack in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his int@@ est@@ ine by taking over the world and fun as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to railway stations , up to Flus@@ hing of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely among a sample
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mu@@ d water . &quot;
in the film he was justified his reputation in any case .
the un@@ preced@@ ing what he abl@@ em@@ ate was a tasty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ hibition showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number of over 4000 units .
compared to this is the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number fresh@@ ly hands less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he cle@@ ared , after its L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number over 4000 units was , while fresh seas@@ oned hands are one of less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; that shows the bacter@@ ial of different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; this comes the worst , which I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not remember here because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
the company rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o V@@ il@@ us that contains both milit@@ ar@@ ter@@ bacter@@ ial as well as vitamin C and D contains to support the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ ak@@ ter@@ ies and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new ones . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and simultaneously explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by that we asked , that we said &apos; L@@ ass we said Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the int@@ est@@ inal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of the int@@ est@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the int@@ est@@ inal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumer insight into an interesting way . &quot;
I think also that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have heard my respect for Ian , when he made some of the things I referred to him , as the ek@@ ective Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring Ian to them , and others , where this was pretty difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these narrow le@@ ak@@ eries on film .
&quot; in one of Vali@@ d conducted survey from 2015 affili@@ ated 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed milit@@ ar@@ ter@@ ia , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and Dar@@ m and 58 per cent they said that they are at least occasionally products , the attached milit@@ ar@@ ter@@ ies contain . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys the vin@@ eg@@ ation of social @-@ app@@ artment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a seaside family left their social @-@ app@@ artment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 5@@ 0.000 , because they had terror@@ ised their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thro@@ wn after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were removed from their property , we found the ownership of the property co@@ oper@@ atives in a ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls gri@@ ev@@ ing holes on , wood di@@ alogues have been excited , tr@@ ash was sc@@ attered on the floor sc@@ attered and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to walls . &quot;
the family were settled and it is accepted that she lives in private accommodation now
&quot; d@@ onna Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the office administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they are not worry that the apartment is no longer . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; it was for people here an absolute Alb@@ mare and I am the view that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , because this property is probably regarded as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is mountain@@ ous and her call is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , which lived in the apartment , and the police told that the ter@@ ror , which had added the family , tr@@ actor with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , drug abuse , drug and exc@@ essive shots , bus@@ h@@ y and flu@@ ctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the le@@ ase , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ b@@ age was found . &quot;

the del@@ og@@ ation were made by light@@ ened neighbours be@@ ju@@ belt that they said their lives to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; she sent to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years besides them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are amazing . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood here because it was here so quiet - this we are not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it could be am@@ am@@ ate the family with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was launched at regular inter@@ vals , 20 years &quot;
on the first @-@ hand side of the community building , tr@@ ash and old toys have been thro@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , since a del@@ og@@ ation always is the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their acts had to be hor@@ ri@@ ble for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the municipality , who had to have taken care of us and have made us the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will sp@@ ends some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti@@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;

she claims that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don was born in 2013 with an accident .
&quot; after they were without shel@@ ter , it will have gone that T@@ anya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms walls of the house were mod@@ ulated with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
the police tells that they will del@@ ve ten@@ ants who do not keep themselves to the house .
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w were part of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that the Del@@ og@@ ation took a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant that will not be stopped to the house . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who are thinking that they can take themselves without self @-@ wor@@ ries , as well as those that were damaged by such a behavior . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall is never criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

we always say that they are very Latin America .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older ge@@ wor@@ den@@ e Maria .
she re@@ members with wh@@ ir@@ ish to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dan@@ ces . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; i feel pretty , o@@ h so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; they res@@ em@@ bles me very , my Italian character that I as a Roman &apos; , lau@@ gh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of the lob@@ by@@ ing in : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artists and very passionate ! &quot;
conduct@@ ing is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in each of its movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is at all very important ! &quot;
&quot; for the American Director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; currently : &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;

apparently he is the view that it is the calendar too .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classical n@@ eness , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community expects to mass flu@@ ctu@@ ations
&quot; who does not fit and Erd@@ ogan , sitting on packed tr@@ aders , &quot; says the president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kur@@ dish village of Germany expects a short term of thousands of protective su@@ ffer@@ ers , which wings from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; medium @-@ term could be even &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the band@@ age of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard approach of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , after putting European Community Germany a mass flu@@ ctu@@ ary to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short term , I expect ten thousand @-@ term , medium @-@ term with some hundreds of hundreds of protection from Turkey to Germany if the Erd@@ ogan regime , minorities and the democratic opposition continues fighting , &quot; says the band@@ age of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has passed over a few months ago with criminal off@@ ences , be 500@@ .000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the ver@@ ted Put@@ sch still per@@ c@@ ari@@ ous and op@@ posi@@ tional eth@@ ical towers .
many are going to start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , who himself takes refugees in their own country refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; he cli@@ cked the targeted settlement of Sy@@ rian Arab@@ ian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
to increase Erd@@ ogan the outlet pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ i@@ ans and Gre@@ eks have been developed or sold over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , which is also CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot;
the band@@ ages requested that the federal government has become as shar@@ p as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and its fol@@ lowers .
also in Germany a &quot; &quot; Wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ ogan cri@@ tics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel more secure in Germany over the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement are also endor@@ sed the flight of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition . &quot;
the fire @-@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer sh@@ red@@ ders and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who@@ ever himself does not fit and Erd@@ ogan , sitting on packed tr@@ aders , by the way , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
&quot; as the paper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Ministers , the Tur@@ ks had already reported the greatest group of the political persecution of the recognised asylum seek@@ ers in Germany . &quot;
&quot; for the end of 30 June , this is 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all being recognized as a master @-@ recognized ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not the face of war , poverty or anti @-@ virus vessels . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so from state side , individually followed . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; then go , where it we@@ ht@@ ut &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the land .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood it .
&quot; in 2005 , the country election will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
for bl@@ ö@@ der than so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ waves - that is attached . &quot;
loc@@ als that are to be convinced by the elect@@ oral fight@@ ers are on vacation .
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the land , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see on the go , are no loc@@ als , therefore may not choose the land . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are help@@ ers , the post@@ ers hang@@ ing , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and at the end of votes count , only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again passed away over the people over themselves over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U Co@@ alition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 stron@@ gest party , is now in sur@@ veys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting how strong Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ e@@ aug@@ ural remaining .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Member sh@@ ef , makes an almost un@@ notic@@ eable choice , one sees from his grand@@ children . &quot;
&quot; he travels through land , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ u@@ sted a little with the people , as it is also his legend@@ ary liter@@ al @-@ dec@@ essor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
otherwise it received soul @-@ old feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or to bl@@ ame in the bl@@ ame of the Af@@ D .
&quot; their refuge@@ e policy , &quot; &quot; We do this &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ated the rise of the sp@@ inal cord , which is likely to cost him to be the beautiful office now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its sh@@ aded data , the inner Minister Lorenz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced , as it is , if one makes at the wrong time in the right place . &quot;
she has invited twice the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel and Merkel and Merkel is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was signed , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as M@@ eckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; kl@@ ag@@ te Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is also nobody to listen to anyone from other cor@@ ners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely push@@ ed onto the usual elect@@ oral distances on market spaces and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ell@@ as and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; this , so said Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; lower role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has spoken out that you have to lead the base the base that they have to be very an@@ str@@ ated again to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are just like the left of the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the W@@ aste of the country barely exist . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election Kok@@ ert to his fellow leaders is also self @-@ reli@@ ably : &quot; &quot; you have to go there , where there are we@@ ht@@ ut , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Gol@@ den@@ e Wed@@ dings , every Birth@@ day party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in sur@@ veys , the S &amp; Ds last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still gained with 35.@@ 6 per cent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the green , small parties with seven percent in the sur@@ veys , could create the le@@ ap into the land . &quot;
they are made out of the holidays - a modern virtu@@ es and ver@@ bs their choice of great @-@ part into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ election campaign , &quot; is called the provin@@ cial Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green choices on tr@@ ace on track @-@ looking for local stim@@ uli among the holiday makers . &quot;
&quot; Silke Ga@@ jek , the Spit@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ d@@ at@@ ine , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ eckl@@ en@@ burg@@ a lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; choice in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not pen@@ alty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : Gast@@ ro suffer from pl@@ ywood
&quot; on the speed , with which the B 27 is san@@ ated , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only against 20 pm , there are all@@ enth@@ al praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything pretty z@@ acked , &quot; tells El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no re@@ treat .
&quot; the site could be planned at the weekends of half @-@ time planned to the south , until the end of October should be done everything . &quot;
&quot; blessed shall also be the den@@ om@@ ination of the responsible person , about when it comes to the establishment of the desc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blo@@ cking of the asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lift@@ ed again and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now run by O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the road transport through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says that of the domestic management of the re@@ organization responsible vice @-@ president of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ lic of Bach@@ er@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ nia had to fight with more traffic paths , because many lighter paths sought and rather their Nav@@ i confidential than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the man@@ cher le@@ vers in residential @-@ areas .
&quot; as well as the speed limitation has not been respected , the con@@ gregation has rein@@ forced the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant cross@@ ings , &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the location . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 St@@ und@@ enk@@ orb in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
for business@@ men at the B 27 there is only one small con@@ st that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the road is open again .
&quot; in the maps , business@@ men will not be able to look for business@@ men . &quot;
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ renovation with them has led to revenue , everyone who is as@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has to do with the &quot; &quot; final customers &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even when the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier talks Thomas Sul@@ z by a &quot; most light decrease , but also one that of course is missing &quot; the pass@@ ag@@ ship . &quot;
the most frequ@@ ented are the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak house , the crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is existence of existence .
&quot; not only him , but all hosts have made it hard . &quot;
they lack the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ because . &quot;
we have to be happy about each Euro turnover .
the revenue grew up on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; Road@@ marking have raised its operation &quot; &quot; to two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to leave .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been de@@ clin@@ ed if the policy would have respon@@ ded differently .
&quot; instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öhn@@ er , whether there may be a financial compensation , otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also influences the dis@@ advantages that arise through the restoration . &quot;
G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other coun@@ ties where such a slightly tr@@ aver@@ se was tr@@ aded .
&quot; with all the Kl@@ ages , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his host@@ ess will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been settled since 1715 here , he pointed to the long history . &quot;
that other Stamm@@ ga@@ este now because of the complicated traffic gui@@ ding less frequently passing , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot go down , it is also very different . &quot;
that his tribe will res@@ ume back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , he has no doub@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and Vogel@@ str@@ ato , G@@ öhn@@ er keeps the impact of the B 27 @-@ construction work to its customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced his taver@@ n in her long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months of construction works which is already brut@@ al .
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terror@@ ist fighting in laws . &quot;
after the recent attacks the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick@@ er security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ gence of ter@@ ror to do with ter@@ ror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ers say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all its proposals were &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
you over@@ demand anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also in short distance me .
&quot; but as an inner minister , it was situated in results and on a &quot; achieved con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the co@@ alition . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has made a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and An@@ sbach have a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are sure to fall out more so far .
&quot; a lot is already known , pro@@ cur@@ red , that a new security authority to take care of the cr@@ acker is un@@ encryp@@ ted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to put forward several EU specifications for aircraft data and ceas@@ ef@@ ire . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; to the part de Ma@@ izi@@ ère a second run for suggestions , which has not been able to make up with the SPD so far , he wants to raise sympathy for terr@@ ying groups under pun@@ ishment and ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with dou@@ bling citizenship . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; sp@@ atial the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; he kept this nevertheless for reasonable and demand@@ ed nothing , which does not have any chances for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ers . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they are partly in itself : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ation and more possibilities for ind@@ ul@@ ing people before the deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who deli@@ ber@@ ately fet@@ ched into the country in order to release their smartphone , and reve@@ al social media accounts for a safety of security . &quot;
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ ses for rej@@ ected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such , the off@@ ences are aware of their identity to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
Man@@ ches also functions un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in case of equal treatment of thought , for example - represents the question : what does this actually do with safety and ter@@ ror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and ter@@ ror . &quot;
but it is not possible that the attacks from An@@ sbach and Würzburg were not possible .
&quot; furthermore , many people are worried about the high refuge@@ e crisis concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people have been deep@@ ened , now also in elect@@ oral lessons are not cl@@ amps . &quot;
the inner security is enormous into the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and An@@ sbach .
the un@@ certainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral . &quot;
Union and the SPD can thus become increasingly on the subject of internal security .
in the last days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ cal argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a safety @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ efs also require a Bur@@ ka ban and a re@@ vers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here about reconc@@ il@@ able sh@@ ades .
from a re@@ vers@@ al of the double pass he won nothing .
we have fri@@ ght@@ ened the discussion in Germany .
&quot; they are new to be rep@@ utable , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he has constitu@@ tional legal concerns .
&quot; whether its own package will be constitu@@ tional to all cor@@ ners , and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reason@@ ably &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ ing partners , has to be yet to show . &quot;
there is a lot of dr@@ in which could make for stress .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to profil@@ ing themselves on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; part@@ ed Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized first time caution and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhance the safety . &quot;
even Volkswagen g@@ limp@@ se is coming through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als the extin@@ ction numbers worldwide .
but not in all markets it works around .
in the re@@ treat there is vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; in the date of Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ bikes , despite its many brands and some well @-@ bit markets continues to advance a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core of the VW went above all in Western Europe and will be charged with them again the total sale , as that in Dax not@@ ched enterprises . &quot;
&quot; worldwide VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year months . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second @-@ most important market , sales up 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the Heimat@@ markt Deutschland ers the deliveries to almost a hex@@ ag@@ onal .
trademark Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ened numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has given rise to some core markets by &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation relating to the Putin &apos;s stress in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um will also be charged to dischar@@ ge from the EU , explain a spok@@ es@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the dent@@ ures first escal@@ ated first , is also further a min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected home@@ use of the Lower Saxony : after the first seven months there is only a supply range of 0.2 percent to 3 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consoli@@ dated Fred Kap@@ ers could continue to have a sales department from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicle delivered Volkswagen at this time from around 5.@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany , VW is calling for around 2.5 million vehicles for the conversion into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW , that the ren@@ ew of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of the vehicles , it give power consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power no det@@ eri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the motorway to the customer after the conversion of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in the start of a company . &quot;
reason are legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen grant his German customers now a guarantee for ren@@ dering diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed on the past Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Germany .
from the traffic noise was confirmed that it was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW did not meet the support of my investig@@ ative Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; explained the Federal Minister Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the warranty , that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the conversion of no det@@ eri@@ or@@ ations , and all the relevant data relevant vehicle values are unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers can come back for example a half year after the conversion into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer inter@@ vals , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage caused by any reason for any guarantee to any guarantee of any guarantee , as it was called . &quot;
that is why I do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from we@@ aving as@@ parag@@ us in future pen@@ is@@ ses - as second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , the 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband Deut@@ scher banks talks about a single case and sees it not a signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us should not be afraid to pay for their as@@ parag@@ us pen@@ al code .
camps banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) they must pay with up to 4 percent pen@@ s .
this fee requires the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September to private and corporate clients for deposits of 100.000 EUR on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 cost will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been lift@@ ed for 40 million euros , which could be removed from one day on the other and which he could not be able to ign@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; that lie with me on the central account and cause 0.3 percent cost , &quot; said the bank chef . &quot;
&quot; I cannot put down for any million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now on the basis of the multip@@ lier .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the Tres@@ ors of the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I had already experienced four survi@@ ving , I like not yet the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank status . &quot;
most customers could have understanding and variety to other applications .
within walking distance to other banks .
the co@@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes significant costs in all banks .
&quot; you alone to wear , be &quot; economically durable not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore raised their charges for con@@ duction , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with pen@@ al code for deposits of three million Euro had made the Thuring@@ ian Economics and ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Skat@@ eboard @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 Headlines .
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , main business leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we are not expecting private clients to pay for deposits , which is the competition in Germany under banks and sp@@ ark@@ ets are much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there &apos; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped from the assets of something . &quot;
&quot; this can become a small bank to the problem , &quot; if they have free money . &quot;
the 1911 established gen@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ sters , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , known actors , ath@@ letes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria are currently no further banks known to calculate a compensation for in@@ soles of private clients , &quot; said Ms Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verb@@ andes der German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ b@@ anks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , had declared an end of June : &quot; the th@@ res@@ hold , into neg@@ atives to the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was hard and there is dro@@ ught the emig@@ ration to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be fallen in the width .
destination sheets : who do not buy multi @-@ board ?
lon@@ ely men with middle ages love plates .
&quot; before you tell for the comment , in order to miss him under the pse@@ ud@@ onym non @-@ le@@ on@@ age group with r@@ auen , this statement leads to current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v is the multip@@ lication of sound boards not on a B@@ oom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the cur@@ iosity of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have recently bought a plate , are all pre@@ caution at the age of 45 and 54 . &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able sound @-@ group .
it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby coll@@ ector - it has an emoti@@ onal meaning : older record runner ( 56 % v@@ s. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend your time ( 69 % v@@ s. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would follow a news report on TV , I would follow myself in the midst of a bust@@ ling road in Soho , before I ste@@ er , my hands will be kept and something determin@@ ant as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart So@@ hos is slowly placed at his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill out the buildings where once independent sellers were settled - there are still a hand@@ ful fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part , within walking distance to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I of Si@@ ster Ray ( data count : eight young women , three men middle age ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes by shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collectors I ask ?
&quot; I &apos;m already wonder@@ ing , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
&quot; this sound boards , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by e ) , cli@@ des the walls of his dw@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he poss@@ esses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford to buy them , when he sold and was sold again , when he was young and pl@@ ei@@ te . &quot;
&quot; many things that I bought are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ s who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably something to young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es to buy that those who are buying , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t smoke very much . &quot;
this is my lo@@ aster .
&quot; GMT , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers , which he meets the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s Profile . &quot;
&quot; he also noticed a new wave to people who heard about the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack and let yourself be seen again to buy their old plates . &quot;
&quot; of the talks , which I have led , people usually did so about 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates now .
this would explain the boom in trailers of the turn@@ table of a certain age .
but what about the appropriate emoti@@ onal meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds to a business like Ph@@ onica to ack@@ no@@ wledge that record stores a so@@ othing community of equ@@ inn@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers have participated in the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
some of the fans will feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted sound@@ proof@@ es , from objects , the happ@@ ier ju@@ ices gu@@ arded . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of the pos@@ al owners as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is as a collectors and I think that there is so many people .
it is a simple way to emplo@@ y spirit@@ ually .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; fl@@ avor@@ ed a staff of one record st@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April , that almost 50 % of the people have purchased a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news , I would probably look very concerned while I refer by a st@@ acked to Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ fort@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Dat@@ ashe@@ ets : three men middle age ) works , has a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; som@@ eb@@ ody came only recently and said : &quot; I am not a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio head , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a large percentage , but it happens definitely . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ bearing , less musical . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , which only slowly come . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated to sound boards nearly one whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I am . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenag@@ ers and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the afor@@ emen@@ tioned shops , - Wild Be@@ ast neu@@ ester syn@@ thesi@@ zer and right @-@ wing Pop instead of experim@@ ental jazz instead of the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks s@@ onder@@ ly lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but the mental psych@@ mat@@ a are hard to det@@ ect@@ able if you stand beside someone over thirty seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for some minutes in the shop and considers the vari@@ es of the sale available for sale . &quot;
it has more of a sho@@ vel b@@ um@@ mel as a big board .
&quot; you don &apos;t deser@@ ve a lot , so the collectors of records is not a real option , says she . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a lover S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how I explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , from which is said that a new generation of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um have to be inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the attack , the jeans hot@@ ap into Mu@@ sters , watching a group of young teen@@ ager to group@@ ing for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a cros@@ ley @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , J@@ eff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it in - perhaps because they are merely purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grip them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these objects mean more money for the sector mean and some customers could send to the dep@@ ths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury homes such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my post @-@ research had vote that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , let them at least in turn@@ around in Soho , the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables who exist in reality , and in On@@ line@@ ate . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with B@@ um@@ m@@ bling along the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while in the star@@ ing sight of an unbe@@ at@@ able , 30 @-@ year @-@ false Moder@@ ator , who fl@@ ake about the shoul@@ ders of the middle aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer over dem@@ oli@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refuge@@ e camps
&quot; a French dish has rej@@ ected a quote of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ z@@ ens of pro@@ visi@@ onal shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in the thousands of refugees , to be back to the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; during a court , this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be pun@@ ching , 72 Provisi@@ onal shops , for cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , for sale , hairdres@@ ser services offer or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visi@@ onal restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be lower , because they would be a parallel economy would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and that is a fire and plumbing . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups are part of the judgment with that the shops and restaurants be important , as the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock . &quot;
they also carried out that the Provisi@@ onal shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there are no legal basis for the bank transfer of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visi@@ onal shops , but sp@@ atial that concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people to feed , who live in extremely pre@@ c@@ ary conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet results between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threat@@ ened by the precip@@ itation , the Jun@@ gle Book Kids &quot; Café des Lag@@ ers , the public classes , and 200 meals a day , Engl@@ ish@@ - and French classes , as well as advice on asylum and un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany sh@@ er have to adjust to the next generation speeds : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effectively . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to acci@@ dents , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by police . &quot;
&quot; for example on highway building , or re@@ visi@@ onal bridges with pre @-@ cu@@ ffs , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary light@@ zer for the compliance with the speed limit@@ er . &quot;
a continuous mobile construction can be too dangerous or consum@@ ing .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is aut@@ ark : his cor@@ dless scre@@ am holds with un@@ inter@@ rupted measurement operation five days , the case data will be encryp@@ ted via an mo@@ dem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also be recorded at the same time all vehicles over several tracks at the same time .
&quot; variable speed restri@@ ction as well as average @-@ related to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monit@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly advanced state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not easy to be t@@ ough@@ ened , it is given in the measurement department , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mored and by the way also f@@ asten the sh@@ avers . &quot;

great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er Rugby - after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold holt
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rugby came in the Final on Thursday evening at an ab@@ rupt H@@ alt in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio . &quot;
Fi@@ ji is a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , desc@@ endants , rul@@ er and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ans of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was born through the not too bad tro@@ ugh@@ s of the silver med@@ al , - Great Britain on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament indeed , in which they sm@@ ote , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als at the same day could be back@@ drop in the fin@@ als . &quot;
but ir@@ respective of this kind could cause Fi@@ ji during this form a 15 @-@ man team in stock .
it could be a comfort - but it will probably not - that at least a burning tomorrow a gold med@@ al to hang his neck is : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from W@@ im@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago they lost under Ry@@ an every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is we@@ ht@@ un , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks of GB@@ s from having fun pic@@ ts .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. , when one would run into driving buses run . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner of r@@ he@@ aled . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of game@@ play , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai was still another attack from the right corner of the left . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly got the ball .
&quot; a bright T@@ ackle from Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third goal to achieve , but it has kept Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute le@@ te J@@ asa Ver@@ ben@@ ua in the right corner one touch @-@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ fi@@ ff , and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ at@@ emo Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ aged through further weak T@@ ackl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ m@@ ed up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 to play while GB is still in @-@ learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time by and completed the fi@@ j@@ ian gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua made tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner of a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running for long in favour of South Korean , whose fans g@@ aps , fl@@ ags , fl@@ ags , and dan@@ ces on the tri@@ b@@ ün@@ e . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame sat the i @-@ bag with another attempt over the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te the Fi@@ j@@ is wa@@ ver@@ ed and GB kick@@ ed down@@ stream in the lawn .
previously at the days Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK dr@@ illed South Africa in a kn@@ itted semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front but Dan N@@ orton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant late del@@ ayed by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ Man teams , sec@@ uring the gain - and thus the silver med@@ al . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning due to fight with the cancer of the trainer for the rowing machine
there will be no motor gold than with these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first stop to the last , 220 hard ho@@ ieve , which enter into the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it were only the examples they were there three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was still present as they had to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , which had such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their mal@@ ter un@@ trained use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ines , which reflect on the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ars , what does not reflect the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the ru@@ de , a Bat@@ a@@ illon is contributing to the incre@@ mental progress that would make the difference and it was no man knew , if he would not know this day at all , when he was diagnos@@ ed with his cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bl@@ ad@@ der , the op@@ eri@@ er@@ able and this did they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it stret@@ ched everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather sh@@ iny situation .
it changes a bit of the view .
Williams was diagnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck , that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which was able to begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , therefore I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would like . &quot;
so it begins .
the ru@@ de itself is a challenge but that makes it an even greater .
&quot; in the im@@ pri@@ ci@@ bility of the victory , their first thoughts of Williams , who took a ner@@ ve each morning to talk something more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ im@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week a emoti@@ onal w@@ re@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repeat@@ edly how much me this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive Th@@ anks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for trainers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not be kept .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , as the teams from New Zealand and Denmark close to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot to reserve . &quot;
we were very cap@@ tured in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in process . &quot;
it is really important to let yourself be mis@@ sed .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make some Great Britain .
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , its own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve back@@ shall . &quot;
now just wants to enjoy the moment .
I wanted to say that my last race was .
that could have had a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London it took approximately six months to concei@@ ve , that I am a Olympi@@ asi@@ fication in London . &quot;
it was all that new for me and I was so gest@@ ur@@ able .
here it lasted about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; the man has to be inv@@ oked with us and indicated , to have been shot up to his life of endanger@@ ing , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors be on the escape , after him will be publicly ti@@ led . &quot;
&quot; by now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 30 meters big , mus@@ cular , brown , brown and has a goo@@ se . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have released a photo by him . &quot;
but it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man contributes a goo@@ se .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he still can bear the weapon in itself , so the police . &quot;
who Sven S. sees that the 110 will call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship company . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors 1981 . &quot;
the competent police in Lübeck didn &apos;t want to make any information on the ather@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; they confirmed that a human being had been killed .

&quot; they stay in the liberation of the Renew@@ able energies for the so @-@ called equity production in the German steel industry , the Federal Ministry of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ day edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really pleased that we could finally reached negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was planned after first , the steel producer , the gas@@ es from the ho@@ ops to go for electricity generation to ask for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry threat@@ ened according to details of German industry sectors additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
&quot; Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , it now also give a ground@@ work with the EU Commission for discussions with competition report on Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works will be replaced , f@@ alle an E@@ EG @-@ lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .

&quot; at the same time , concentrate on your own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cog@@ ni@@ tive challenge . &quot;
&quot; older people , who live alone , practice not only on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives you through the s@@ ingen in the choir .

Cats respond sensitive as a cr@@ ater to the kitt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investig@@ ated in Hanover how the effects of p@@ sychi@@ atri@@ sts has grown to adult animals .
&quot; too , the males did not let the males not cold - however they stopped in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the ar@@ ous@@ degree of p@@ sychi@@ atr@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the cl@@ one .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von kitt@@ ens who were in great dist@@ ressing , such as scientists from the veterinary University and Medical University of Hannover ( M@@ HH ) . &quot;
cr@@ aters also respond to the ru@@ p of kitt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly inter@@ rupt pu@@ ps for the males either not percei@@ ved or not of meaning &quot; , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by der M@@ HH . &quot;
&quot; it is first author@@ ised in the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C E@@ volu@@ tionary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ ens , with the ur@@ gency of its help@@ fulness . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult ch@@ ater and eight kitt@@ ens have been observed from the animal welfare of the M@@ HH . &quot;
you were played for a rod of Kl@@ einen that were taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; for others they were confront@@ ed with cr@@ y of stronger bre@@ ens , which were also high@@ lighted . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the limited samp@@ ling for mean@@ ing@@ ful .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had its own off@@ spring , re@@ structured differenti@@ ated to the Sch@@ rei@@ e , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they are faster to the loud@@ speakers if this ru@@ fe of the very ar@@ ous@@ ehold kitt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be suppos@@ edly or develop with lov@@ emaking .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
scientists have already studied many times in the past several times when the reactions of women and men are examined .
&quot; in doing so , some studies showed that women were sensitive to m@@ amm@@ ed because they were already mot@@ hers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Bar@@ um@@ ann . &quot;

&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are sus@@ pic@@ ked up the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len which one is responsible for the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , there is not even before football . &quot;
against the former St@@ ark@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r presented the pro@@ sec@@ utor a warran@@ t .

&quot; although the first valid for 90 days is confirmed , even until October , actually , this has the life of most towers but as good as no effects . &quot;
&quot; the next &quot; &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has been Erd@@ ogan on Wednesday for over . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in fol@@ lowers and opponents er@@ do@@ gans .
&quot; particularly fans of the workers in settlements , traditionally not count to the friends of the president . &quot;
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks , but given a dramatic experience in history , the strict rej@@ ection of military co@@ ats . &quot;
there are even the fans themselves - no matter whether their heart sugge@@ sts for Gal@@ end@@ ar@@ ay or settlements .

&quot; according to the Pre@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League of the &quot; &quot; Lö@@ wen &quot; &quot; in the Europa League soon . &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g it is only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is done , and this is the most important , &quot; said po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master settlements , the game was running better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who conducted with 26 seasons , as sw@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ tor@@ ch @-@ tor@@ ches the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .

Bom@@ ben@@ ter@@ ror in Thailand - Austr@@ al@@ in bre@@ ach - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Frei@@ day early . &quot;
they have suffered of inter@@ wo@@ unds and be treated in the hospital I have already left again .
they have planned her home for early September .
&quot; whether by the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on is also affected in the Austrian citizen . &quot;
&quot; the external Ministry of State , in relation to medium @-@ sized contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; situated around 200 kilometres at the south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thurs@@ days at the Thurs@@ days of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police i have been killed a Tha@@ il@@ changing and about 20 people had been in@@ ju@@ red , including Austrian Germans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; early morning again , two spra@@ yers went back up again , so according to the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing explo@@ sion .
near the det@@ on@@ ation near the holiday popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red to police @-@ drivers a taxi driver .

the spr@@ eng@@ ment was nois@@ y to the authorities in a flower bul@@ b in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police police in the air .
finally the determin@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ GA and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several regions .
&quot; you go from one connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , was called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said the Dan@@ bur@@ eral Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Frei@@ day before journalists . &quot;
we go from that it is a coordin@@ ating Att@@ ac@@ ke .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ ves - most likely , however , however , it is about the de@@ eds of Muslim re@@ b@@ els . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ bing mus@@ li@@ m separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police on the other explained , the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said an spok@@ es@@ person in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; however , one go from that the bom@@ bs of the ruling class of the ruling class were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had given mysterious notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still be un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed her officials in the whole country , the security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarter . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ ben@@ ches , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands König B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol AD@@ UL@@ Y@@ A@@ DE@@ J .
after the reason bom@@ bard@@ ed bom@@ bs recommen@@ ds the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to provide the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) taught for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ u , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ana and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between the security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary to get into this provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday served a few days after a re@@ disp@@ uted refer@@ endum on one of the military j@@ unta .
these sp@@ atial the military has a great influence in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha , the bom@@ bs were to be an attempt to sti@@ pul@@ ated the country towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the j@@ unta , who had taken power after a phase blo@@ ody un@@ rest the power , holds itself good to have the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not succ@@ eeded in the military for@@ efr@@ ont of the country for years in the extreme south of the country , to get a cross @-@ level re@@ b@@ els into the handle . &quot;
in the conflict more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
&quot; prior to a year ago , in Bangkok was killed at a popular Hind@@ u Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the blo@@ ody r@@ ash of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is coming into the vis@@ or of the Federal Ministry for Con@@ stitu@@ tional Protection .
&quot; according to several countries , the constitu@@ tional makers in the covenant have put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; practices for aspir@@ ations against the aff@@ ecting democratic principles , &quot; said Ver@@ stitu@@ tional Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , belonging to the Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way diff@@ ers . &quot;
that is why we watch the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; is an group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is turning against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ise &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity by crossing . &quot;
&quot; compress@@ ors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Niedersachsen , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been closely align@@ ed with the provin@@ cial committees . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience , where she stands , &quot; said the Con@@ stitu@@ tional Treaty . &quot;
&quot; generally try extre@@ mi@@ sts , they pre@@ ached with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ ers music . &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a bet@@ u@@ tive advertising for your own thing .
the prop@@ aganda is to speak the people emoti@@ onal .
young people are present in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last , it had given several federal states reports about contacts of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ gh@@ an politicians . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said he did not have knowledge .
&quot; for the constitu@@ tional protection , possible contacts of this type is only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extre@@ mis@@ sible , its aim is changing and thus extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so if such individuals can control the influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view of the distinct increase of legal off@@ ense and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refuge@@ e , Ma@@ ined , he would not speak out of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have established in the past few years that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler Group .
&quot; it can be quite sure that further legal separ@@ ati@@ sts or small groups , form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e sh@@ ei@@ es or attacks from other legal moti@@ fs . &quot;
a range or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ ty is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the existing groups were taken on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ined about that many of the handles on the account of people entered into appearance before not in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying red@@ emption .
many of the fact that attacks on A@@ syl@@ um were not as crimin@@ als to be well known politically motiv@@ ated or fol@@ lowers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed off@@ ences , which were previously with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts not nothing at the hat , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , which then have been radi@@ c@@ alised by right @-@ wing isol@@ ation . &quot;

&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ ath the slightly over@@ fle@@ d@@ able swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia , so slow that he was no longer see in the TV images . &quot;

&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a re@@ volt of 48 seconds its lead and bel@@ te the 59@@ th square of 59 Star@@ tern . &quot;

&quot; his time , he sle@@ pt only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of free style , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ is@@ ons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pond from the Equ@@ atorial @-@ Guinea , when he had to compete in a pioneer over 100 metres of free style . &quot;

&quot; fees per cu@@ bic meters = water is from 1 October 2016 for the field of hydro@@ gen Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of up to 10 euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the complex in Az@@ endorf , the cancellation fee will be later to increase once , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a relevant calculation , the b@@ water price will be in Az@@ endorf then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) , was reported in the approval of the budget through the land@@ rat of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; the market Kas@@ endorf may be committed to legal foundations , the systems are cost @-@ effective . &quot;
&quot; from 1 . October 2016 will be the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial actu@@ ator of pupp@@ y , Neu@@ dorf , Az@@ endorf , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the consum@@ ables are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt was pointed to the Panel of the Board of Shar@@ ing the fees for the water @-@ water of the market . &quot;
&quot; during the period of October 2016 to September 2020 , even exc@@ essive / or under@@ carriage from the previous cal@@ c@@ ination period . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ving sc@@ atter@@ aged Schmidt with so that there is relatively small facilities at relatively small facilities with a very low waste water , between 68@@ 00 and 12000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low shi@@ fting basis for example expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water comes in all three systems easily re@@ visi@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the under@@ lying cal@@ c@@ ation period in all three systems are not least due to its age accounting and repair applications in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf be nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be ex@@ changed because of damage .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing world , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be re@@ built up , and in case of the pond clari@@ fication according to the first se@@ wage plant , the clari@@ fies and an additional ventilation possibility to be able to maintain the water legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expendi@@ tures came the continued supervis@@ or and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new cal@@ m@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs that during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still significantly under the current level .
&quot; stone houses made clearly , that at low waste water in the three systems , the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sup@@ plem@@ ented Schmidt , the market @-@ community of great entertainment costs in the last 20 years . &quot;
the situation for the afor@@ emen@@ tioned plants will continue to be pre@@ ached in the duration of stone houses on the duration still to be able to expand the supply area of the water sof@@ ten@@ ing Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al in order to cannot extend this plant because it deals with de@@ fic@@ it@@ arian facilities .

the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; effect as a Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users , to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that &apos;s ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be painting from a Roy Light . &quot;
&quot; the filter are indisp@@ ensable , stand@@ ing@@ ing tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all fail@@ ures will come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved out in the past in the past that they were acc@@ uses that the App Black@@ face @-@ dere or white skin would act as beauty deal .
&quot; when this week some U@@ sers got a filter , who gave them lo@@ ung@@ ers , false teeth and film@@ ed w@@ angen , there were some cri@@ tics a r@@ ass@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Gel@@ b@@ face &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeti@@ tive cont@@ ro@@ ses to a greater problem that the company has communic@@ ated with diversity .
&quot; the news and sens@@ ations have been widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat that it would have enabled the feature . &quot;
the company had an exc@@ use : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to Anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but the out@@ si@@ ders , the rac@@ ism have experienced , re@@ minded of the filter at hur@@ t Kl@@ isch@@ ees . &quot;
others bor@@ dering the Anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Gr@@ ace Spar@@ apan@@ i , an Korean @-@ American artwork , whose Twe@@ et have been widely spread over the photos that the filter was vulner@@ able and h@@ aul@@ ing un@@ comfortable . &quot;
they added that &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the objects of a very confli@@ ct@@ ing Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter@@ effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not guaranteed , but that the money is drawn into the value of Extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cross@@ es this cultural st@@ rolling .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in a end@@ less di@@ vers@@ al and integral steam , of the conference rooms , up to Hollywood and the devices that we are all in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - those involved in race di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ s - could be expecting to be expected by raising awareness .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters make an image created that for a user is busy , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as product@@ manag@@ erin and Ingenie@@ ur@@ ine for Medium , her Snap@@ chat account you requested others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone , she said that they believe that r@@ attle @-@ related cont@@ ro@@ ses to reflect a lack of theft with snap@@ shots at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part of white , only male leaders and ended their elev@@ ators with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin coloured , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ esi@@ ch @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin paints , who they work there , but not in positions where they are safe or feeling to say what to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a compl@@ aint that the snap@@ chat has been largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any figures to the diversity of its work@@ force and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat began to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a donation , the company has recently assembled a human responsible groups and focused on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that they shall be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
military management of IS@@ IS intelligence information , presents the Committee of Congress . &quot;
&quot; military action of the United States Central Command modified software , to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria , as there were the actual states on the spot by the Congress of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary Report , created by a Task Force of the re@@ publi@@ ci@@ ees members of the armed forces , sec@@ uring the committee and the W@@ ehr@@ ted com@@ mit@@ es , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret analy@@ sts who reported their reviews on the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American Mil@@ estone in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; News alert , which were sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically have been posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual states on the spot and were passed more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a time article report . &quot;
&quot; what when Cent@@ Com has happened is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer from the poor analysis of our political leaders , &quot; presented K@@ en Cal@@ ver@@ t , re@@ publi@@ ci@@ ous member of the Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership error in the Cent@@ Com reach up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report provides detailed information in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Ira@@ q@@ i Arm@@ ed For@@ ces .
&quot; although there is no direct indications that government tips given under Obama instructions given to change reports , how analy@@ sts were exposed to the pressure of their pre@@ judi@@ ces , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL to draw . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements , statements and statements before the Congress is clearly positive when the facts corresponds to the facts &quot; presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com arri@@ vals were publicly known that a military re@@ con@@ quest Mos@@ s already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , is so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ can@@ ian con@@ gresses of Kan@@ sas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the points of Central Command are changing reports to run the danger through IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
Republi@@ can@@ er ri@@ ef@@ en the Task Force into Life after they played that analy@@ sts were worried about the manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday released will be completed by more detailed findings during the invent@@ ories .
additional income of the Cent@@ Com reports by the general in@@ spec@@ ter of the Ministry of Def@@ ence in G@@ ange .
&quot; democratic members of the news on Thursday , their own insights published on Thursday , which are co@@ inci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the re@@ publi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essive complete process for creating new products at IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ q@@ i security services , &quot; announced the highest dem@@ ocr@@ at house Adam B. ship , in an opinion known . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. S@@ hip , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of chann@@ eling reports , &quot; damage the Mor@@ al under analy@@ sts and &apos; announced little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. S@@ hip , and the dem@@ ocr@@ ats gave no evidence to an intervention of the White House with the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st regarding a &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investigation by the general in@@ spec@@ ter of the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spok@@ es@@ person by the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Def@@ ence Council would not be reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general in@@ spec@@ imen is still in the way . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the def@@ ender of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigation of re@@ percus@@ sions have taken over the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Def@@ ence ) .
&quot; however , the debt of the last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for volunte@@ ering the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the Secret Government on the Islamic State rec@@ all over ten years , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory H@@ ook@@ er , as the former government under George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many analy@@ sts who saw the recommendations of many analy@@ sts in Iraq and make up little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. H@@ ook@@ er also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. H@@ ook@@ er propos@@ es that the statements of the government agencies would have no significant impact on the financial situation of terr@@ ing group , since these pro@@ visi@@ onal refin@@ eries have had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s at that time , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of legislative because of its super@@ ficial assessment of the war@@ ri@@ ment before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced with Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA attract fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain before . &quot;
&quot; a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 year over Japan , K@@ atie BA@@ M made the first two gates of the American field boot@@ ing of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the American people with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance but BA@@ M ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
I was not one to the people who retain their gates of memory .
&quot; however , they know however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the British in their first place , which remain un@@ sur@@ passed after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide to gain the first and second place in their group . &quot;
the first @-@ place will walk somewhat longer from the path that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game likes to go out on Saturday , the Americans have trig@@ ger@@ ed a Surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they land@@ ed over the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; it grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years of Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ bat in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she was the latest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she passed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not quali@@ fy for the K@@ ader . &quot;
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team everything went up .
&quot; in the next year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ on , trainer of the national teams , and thus the things began to apply for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said BA@@ M . &quot;
we didn &apos;t had the working time in London that we now have .
we have completely re@@ vers@@ ed the Ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening the BA@@ M opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with an attack from the local area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed herself surpris@@ ingly f@@ enced and kept the game of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until BA@@ M took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a spr@@ int with the fl@@ ush ball over the left f@@ lange , then moved into the middle and airy the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Melissa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , which had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just as BA@@ M .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the r@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
&quot; wherever you are also , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel free and un@@ balanced , a swi@@ ft fo@@ cal point between competition and endeav@@ our . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning st@@ ab , which is protected from the w@@ rist@@ ers to the swi@@ mmer for the tri@@ ath@@ letes . &quot;
&quot; you cannot turn the TV set off , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ b@@ ors in the qu@@ eu@@ e in the coff@@ e@@ hop without over Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ading y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could indeed have been sent among these known names which were sent to Prime Time , re@@ built by sponsors and char@@ ge@@ able TV @-@ advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flam@@ me illumin@@ ated not every event equal .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shadow are the sports fields that are not commonly known : air @-@ pist@@ ol sh@@ oth@@ es , Archery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the Bre@@ ast swi@@ m and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but when I describe arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me make attention on the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline already existed since 2000 a olymp@@ ic event , when it had been in Sydney that many that , I had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could be also regional ign@@ or@@ ance .
&quot; although the US ath@@ letes go to the competition , there has never been a med@@ al in the trampoline and until 2012 has had an ath@@ letes , who has made it up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold med@@ al from London .
&quot; the jump@@ ing jump@@ ing has a certain external sei@@ ter@@ char@@ me , partly because it is the un@@ clear ear solution for a c@@ lown@@ fish , as the for the Olympic Games sounds . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a re@@ born enthusi@@ ast bin . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ri@@ ders of his never to end to end the adv@@ ent - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and dive , which combines two sports . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; jump@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; stret@@ ching winner at a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to take a number of falling movements ( Dre@@ w , He@@ orges and Sal@@ tos ) before they end on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ x after execution , difficulty and &apos; flight times . &quot;
&quot; secondary ath@@ letes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are to compete in Rio with each other . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold continues to go faster , up@@ wards and dr@@ over , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes down and back , up@@ wards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the starting @-@ sw@@ amp , but in the television trans@@ ference also another manufacturer : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful endeav@@ our is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to make even a audience to te@@ ars . &quot;
but it is also what I find themselves when looking at this games as something er@@ f@@ atigue .
of which the trampoline offers a breath @-@ break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a pre@@ heating movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ ono@@ un@@ ced , se@@ em@@ ingly heavy as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up@@ wards , then down , then tired again up . &quot;
&quot; here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but while the exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tical attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the tr@@ um@@ eric , elegant acc@@ umulation of time and gra@@ vity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the contest for the Olympic Games can only be .

&quot; one generation prot@@ ests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a composite of the USA &quot;
viol@@ ent prot@@ ests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters the political changes in Ethiopia demand the resistance to the government .
witnesses say that the forty prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ r .
is Ethiopia just breaking down ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the stable countries of Africa , a solid band@@ ed of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last few months , prot@@ ests against the government the country and more widespread in over the past few months . &quot;
last week &apos;s thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ est fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was nois@@ y to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave that the polic@@ emen on zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and bap@@ tism .
&quot; in addition to the prot@@ est videos about the prot@@ ests , which probably come from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety of young people are forced with pun@@ ching , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Convention for Human Rights is now calling for an in@@ coming examination .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this land and will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Project manager of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most abundant country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the west .
&quot; American army and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian authorities to fight terror@@ ist over the region , especially in Som@@ alia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western aid . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy is expanding in the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dram@@ atically improved - there is a new roof @-@ suit in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ eba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations , the op@@ pression against the government has been restricted - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dis@@ pres@@ idents were effectively applied to silence . &quot;
many have been sent to ex@@ ile or in prison , killed or into the mad@@ ness of the desert . &quot;
&quot; however , this could change . &quot;
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and those no other options have to prot@@ est out , breaks it off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in Central . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ests .
one generation prot@@ ests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil use up to the thro@@ wing in terms of power of the co@@ alition .
&quot; after a bl@@ ended choice last year , the rule of the party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the ten@@ sions along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for these z@@ ack@@ able , um@@ versi@@ al line called for June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ clear front or the National Liber@@ al front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which could be more or less forced to protect the tur@@ bul@@ ence and once again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ation after years of before proce@@ eding before the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smart@@ phones .
&quot; only in the last few years ago , very much Ethiop@@ ian has been able to communicate with social media , since cheaper smart@@ phones were becoming more common and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government initi@@ ates access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular inter@@ vals , especially with prot@@ ests , do many people still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , where they can hold . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ian gave that they gathered themselves to prot@@ ests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ co@@ smo@@ s and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ es in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ co@@ smo@@ s and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since equi@@ ties the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from the eth@@ th@@ op@@ ause of the Aegean Sea , in politics and economy , while taking the Oro@@ co@@ smo@@ s , of which many Muslims are living and in flat @-@ regions . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a shield , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ co@@ smo@@ s . &quot;
the biggest prot@@ ests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have domin@@ antly domin@@ ates that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that are about six percent of the population and the military service , in the intelligence and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ aw@@ i .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ known disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about cor@@ ners . &quot;
analy@@ sts say that he was particularly se@@ aled in it was to make early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special requests to edit opponents and make them ir@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lack@@ ing on this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected to accept the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ hts region Nord@@ ä@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South . &quot;
analy@@ sts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia lived such a re@@ bel@@ lion , in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government of analy@@ zers and subsequently st@@ olen by the government . &quot;
&quot; while the following swe@@ eps were killed many prot@@ esters , even though it were less than in the last few months , and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts commen@@ ced the Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infra@@ structures , as well as the new p@@ end@@ ler@@ al train , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty ab@@ dom@@ ination . &quot;
but obviously this is not the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month attacks prot@@ esters in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ sh town , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the h@@ ate towards the Tig@@ ray is always in social media . &quot;
analy@@ sts say that the prot@@ ests of the USA and other western allies in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for emergency flights over the neighbor@@ ing Som@@ alia , even if she recently re@@ member@@ ed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West to support democracy , he does not want to support its allies in a fully vol@@ ati@@ len region . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declar@@ es his argument Obama was founded in IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp search@@ ed on Friday the last cont@@ ro@@ vers@@ y to gather his campaign that his many repeat@@ edly repeti@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terr@@ an Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
this clari@@ fy new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can@@ al data of the Republi@@ can@@ er on whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his compassion , who endeav@@ our to take him during an inher@@ ited stage in protection , in the owner , which he could not have meant to be shared . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the jud@@ gement on the evening evening , ru@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp regarding the claim on Thursday and consi@@ sted in interviews that he really had not intended to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have had IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply s@@ arc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , to which Mr. Tru@@ mp is said in a number of interviews , he said the exc@@ use completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp would help him to prevent him , that Mr. Obama IS@@ IS wants to destroy it , the re@@ publi@@ que pres@@ idential Presidency wanted nothing to know . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ selt to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to draw the focus of his campaign because of a long @-@ standing experience on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday she tried to return Mr. Tru@@ mp again to this topic .
on Twitter he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has previously made Sar@@ kas@@ mus already in his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said Rus@@ sians , Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ mails h@@ acking , but stated later &quot; &quot; Natural I mean the s@@ arc@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then return to your needs .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test like certain messages of his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said R@@ uth Sher@@ man , a communication of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I believe , he is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of resol@@ utions the tone for the pres@@ idential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted a still used sound because his in@@ quiries have passed on . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist that was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ an @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ abul@@ ary , he considers his cri@@ tics to cons@@ ume its statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is rein@@ forced in the focus of attention in recent months of its pres@@ idential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps Scher@@ ze his lo@@ yal fellow leaders in the un@@ comfortable situation related to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ ol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ m@@ ps prominent interests , gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legi@@ timate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true that in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ ward , completely wrong and therefore it came because he went forth the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the ma@@ instre@@ am Republi@@ can try to argu@@ ing that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as the Foreign Minister , it used to spread the situation in the Middle East ag@@ gressi@@ vely in control . &quot;
&quot; in front of the elect@@ oral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp its attacks on the media and cast them to be taken away on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he glori@@ fied the &apos; poor , j@@ essi@@ ble &quot; television experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; you can &apos;t . &quot;
some of the dem@@ ocr@@ ats spot@@ ted over Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps exc@@ use as just another proof that he is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idential race .
&quot; once again passed over the price from the market , Café in green@@ point back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fat@@ al café in William@@ sburg , where you can only pay cash at no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , due to the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue plots front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , the Ver@@ b in the summer 2014 re@@ connected , sold soap in the form of c@@ up@@ . &quot;
local det@@ ected it as last loss in a gent@@ l@@ ative city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ass wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still don &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea hotel is increased and ver@@ b now a soap @-@ shop is now . &quot;
&quot; but when new York change is , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is also always good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; as a customer offered a customer , money for a new out@@ lined , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , beh@@ aves much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ ome model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experim@@ ent .
he carried out new ingredients .
on the menu you are sand@@ wich@@ es with b@@ acon and cheese and there are wardrobe such as cap@@ ers and su@@ ed onions .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
&quot; the cafe serves no beer more , so there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ ressed electricity at old tribe . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also sold through prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently in a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , stayed in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they moved to green@@ point , she would take the way to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she had a while the coffee beans , she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that it was born on coffee and culture in the ver@@ b , who fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink again coffee , even if they asked for this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees appointed a bl@@ ended Ch@@ ai Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ year since the beginning of the verse in 2003 .
he went there before work and initi@@ ated un@@ femin@@ ine is always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with but@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experim@@ ent and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with sp@@ eck , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no ground@@ ed that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the coffee as an ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu @-@ map into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he pres@@ et you soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local s@@ aft@@ ors would like to fill the cold coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe on a neighbor@@ ing building exp@@ ands .
for many customers a new drawing is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was timber and said that he was destroyed on the ground as the Café closed .
&quot; as the new café opened , Wh@@ itt , that the beg@@ ining of the restaurant and the order of a new coff@@ ees like a home@@ coming home . &quot;
&quot; I had to get , &quot; he said . &quot;
the primary food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as enemies , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fif@@ th Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ tor@@ tie soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a bit mod@@ est : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato p@@ ü@@ ree and as des@@ sert a pl@@ au@@ men@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband has added Andrew Co@@ e , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; on life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , who will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , S@@ ör@@ kel@@ lo@@ sem I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh bread with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato p@@ ü@@ ree and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; as the Rep@@ or@@ ter Hack@@ eb@@ aten , this was found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were Erd@@ ogan , liver and beans . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredi@@ ent and a little Bil@@ li@@ gem which stret@@ ched the ingredi@@ ent .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must have been placed in the stomach like B@@ lei , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years ago the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
teams of women boil@@ ed for male field@@ workers and it has been fresh@@ ly bak@@ ed past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were Americans who fl@@ ake during the first World War foods to hun@@ gry Europeans . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; stands out the paths to which the country will deal with it , no longer the sm@@ ar@@ aff@@ le . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans were a central , an@@ gi@@ fted theme , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as ten@@ se was the new bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious food like lo@@ aves and k@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were restored to fundamental nutri@@ tious , the k@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as &quot; wonderful species , &quot; mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , since ba@@ it in@@ appe@@ aling ingredients under a cre@@ m@@ ful Sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by billi@@ ger@@ es dr@@ en@@ ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , the long @-@ term of the American cuisine was a rare luxury . &quot;
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ es have been promised , as a cal@@ ori@@ ous and nour@@ ishing satisfaction even before taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , travelled a dish from that ep@@ och , bak@@ ed onions with pe@@ anu@@ ts but@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it was not any any supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann leads further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ ts and bak@@ ed onions are not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ wives .
&quot; as never before or since then , tri@@ cky households - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 , 1943 to 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country . &quot;
&quot; they published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ aged women to become &quot; budget &quot; &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e as cream@@ y Sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with carr@@ ots to transform to delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square of &quot; &quot; is a festival of historical monuments . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the answer of the government to the hun@@ gry citizen , like president Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ lick me cake . &quot;
&quot; while he is open the simple I@@ owa farm@@ cuisine in his kitchen , he has become clear@@ er like the milli@@ on@@ ary sever@@ ity man from the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he called continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost Gil@@ ded menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful real@@ fort@@ worth .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have been committed to the same error if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the an@@ heu@@ l of a budget with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most tro@@ ugh food . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was thro@@ wn , once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ acy is on our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food was applied . &quot;
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans in mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw foods .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man re@@ minded : &quot; she actually made people really si@@ ck .
there were the wind@@ le inci@@ dent .
&quot; after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cle@@ ared , they moved and co@@ e a des@@ sert that they had prepared at home : the p@@ aving des@@ sert , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip called , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a usually tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble recipes to send a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no ground@@ ed cream , only p@@ aving , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
everyone wick@@ ed something res@@ o@@ ed a spo@@ on in the fol@@ ks , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , it is not bad . &quot;
Co@@ e did three times a post .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opp@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar wid@@ me@@ te his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old self is dead in a fac@@ et @-@ attack of the Assad &apos;s regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; , &quot; a civil@@ isation group , the according to image @-@ newspaper so far nearly 6@@ 0,000 people saved the life . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own lives in the game to draw people from cer@@ ni@@ fied houses and to deliver the first aid in the war .
they are the her@@ oes of the war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of civ@@ ilians who shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house dating back to the world .
it made the Sy@@ rian to illumin@@ ant symbols in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as her@@ oes he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I love to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ y@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself fell to an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bard@@ ment in Syria . &quot;
hel@@ icopter have four fac@@ tur@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district that was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as .

&quot; dear s@@ lu@@ pent@@ ag@@ o , they are used as they used mainly to S@@ val@@ b@@ ard six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ ot still make this ha@@ ie , nevertheless : in the m@@ agen of an animal , researchers , the remains of a ro@@ b , another had left the or@@ thodon@@ tics of a young ice @-@ bears . &quot;
possibly co@@ inci@@ dent@@ ally they sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ il@@ ing on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ aver which consist of higher water @-@ stories according to the bottom .
Juli@@ us N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues are subject to 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie the fisher@@ men between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as a com@@ mitt@@ ing from the depth of the nor@@ dat@@ an@@ tik@@ s .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters , while the largest gold cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , analy@@ zed them with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lin@@ sen@@ core of the hair . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ ids arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained ther@@ ein contained in it is no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest hair had a stri@@ king much carbon @-@ 14 in the left corner .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 60@@ s , as nuclear weapon attempts greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters length of third animal , the left @-@ hand per@@ forms a low level of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had created normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which arises in the atmosphere by cosmic radi@@ otherapy in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 493 cen@@ tim@@ eters long pain@@ land@@ hai , an age of 335 years , during the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Green@@ land@@ shar@@ k can only get off@@ spring if they are longer than four metres , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could arrange an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals have been determined with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters , at the th@@ res@@ hold of lov@@ emaking , and his age was determined with 156 years , Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one @-@ half centuries . &quot;
also this is likely to be the world @-@ tre@@ m@@ ble for whirl@@ wind .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in heated waters is no co@@ inci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Green@@ land@@ wal , in its sp@@ eck in the N@@ eck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ en@@ spitze , was caught in Alaska . &quot;
due to the low temperatures often the organis@@ m of the living animals live on as@@ parag@@ us .
it is therefore later - and al@@ more s@@ lower .
&quot; to keep in the cold water warm , the animals also often become especially large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , thanks to the animal heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram is therefore much greater than at one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , it should invest in a long life on the other hand . &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg will attract the best opportunities to move from London to create jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am profit from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , Head of the Compet@@ enc@@ ast financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it refer@@ endum , it is un@@ certain if money will continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU pass you have so far as the approval in the UK so far .
this just take advantage of big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ ing &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; expects to 10000 new jobs at the Main tur@@ nen five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance of E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ RB . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the not@@ ch is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg heated a large f@@ ond@@ on industry , but also like Dublin in the infrastructure or worse . &quot;
Frankfurt be much easier to reach the great airport thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with light available storage devices . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; in the Seine , the ten@@ ets for first @-@ class commercial applications by 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ran@@ king of corporate advice Mer@@ c@@ er , the city on place seven , Luxembourg on square 19 , Dublin on square 33 and Paris at 37@@ . place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a question of love be : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial position for the European single market , Frankfurt would be inv@@ iting to Frankfurt banks and investors &quot; &quot; followed the I@@ W . &quot;
London I will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um the most important financial centre in Europe .
&quot; for this also the forces of forces : in London worked according to numbers from Landes@@ bank Hel@@ ab@@ a at the end of 2015 approximately 14@@ 4000 people in the bank of bank , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

Jewish Director Sh@@ ape Berliner Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election according to &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; call removed - RT News
&quot; a french director with Jewish roots shi@@ fted a medi@@ ation , after having betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pres@@ election since there would have an Arab@@ ian guests according to a employee . &quot;
Claude Bor@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by offering an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay we tried to find Israel on the di@@ ary list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel rooms . &quot;
&quot; what is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel been elimin@@ ated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ inks@@ i Bristol has a possibility to choose Israel about a private call center .
after a statement we turned the director to the hotel &apos;s recipe .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the Hotel@@ ordered said that the measure a &quot; sec@@ ular choice of the managers of Kemp@@ inski Hotels be . &quot;
&quot; the reason , the behind it was , the cr@@ ust in the director nor even more r@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s , and they have demand@@ ed that the election shall be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trade , this was a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; tells the South German newspaper . &quot;
we were kid@@ n@@ apped by this event and short@@ ened .
this really is very sh@@ am@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has already carried out in this hotel chain , even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dent delet@@ es a rather big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people find the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
some examined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the all@@ eged supervision of Arab@@ ian guests . &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed you , &quot; was found it in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ ble Kur@@ für@@ stend@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel pointed quickly all the exc@@ uses of themselves and called the inci@@ dent &quot; &quot; failure &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; , &quot; tells the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct instruction , Israel did not enter the quick@@ search list , &quot; quoted the South German newspaper a speaker at Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;

&quot; Hin@@ du@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ ors - and sk@@ inner continued in the quali@@ fying round an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ ills the jump@@ ing in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his round , after his round back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and sk@@ inner . &quot;
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation from the execution in a higher course to slow@@ down him and allow it to hold the pace to hold the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert , and fell sk@@ inner , pass@@ y and hin@@ ts , as those on the po@@ dium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a sch@@ ick@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defe@@ ated the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to gain .
&quot; after the tri@@ umph 2012 at the side &apos;s label , and Ho@@ ys gave addition to that he moved to a weak start to the rail@@ road . &quot;
he moved to this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England ri@@ vals .
so there was no such a problem in such a reality .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB fl@@ ags on the tri@@ b@@ ün@@ e like London . &quot;
we have joined in the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have come so bad@@ ly away with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of possible that he has repeat@@ edly repeated the victory of three olymp@@ ic gold@@ medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mon Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a spin @-@ mare of six Gold@@ medals and a Silver med@@ al mean . &quot;
the birds of the testi@@ cles equal .
pass@@ y will be part in the Spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the Team @-@ Event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels like lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; said , &quot; When he wins two more Gold@@ medals , he ought to be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts competition of the day , but there were another good news for England . &quot;
Sir Br@@ l Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , St@@ even Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fast@@ est performance in four @-@ four @-@ miles . &quot;
she came in 3 : 5@@ 38,@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the World @-@ Cor@@ d , who won in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) can be held on the second day of competition , on the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus . &quot;
he had cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ al himself yesterday with authority in front of the qualification as a work@@ piece to measure his height .
&quot; in the appropriate women competition , the tomorrow continue and ended , av@@ anci@@ ated Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ w@@ av@@ ie in world tre@@ ach time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves themselves to domin@@ ate its strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a sn@@ ar to medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio has been driven . &quot;
&quot; it played out dram@@ as in the background , so the withdrawal of the technical suffering Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ st@@ worthy as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees himself the first evening of competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then that the legend@@ ary reputation GB@@ s that has reached the perfect moment for its climax again . &quot;
future of mel@@ ting Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminium housing of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - standing on the game , since the system operators have announced the energy contract and thus will lift all the supply agreements , as the lie@@ de energy @-@ company wed@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to the operation of the facility . &quot;
one for 20 years of the agreement will run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are standing on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and in@@ direct - could be at risk .
&quot; in addition , it could occur to Dom@@ ino@@ eff@@ ects , since the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity is Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a clos@@ es .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the stra@@ its of the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which is the large aluminum tr@@ ace with its Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ station in Lat@@ robe Valley bel@@ il@@ t , distributed , that three other owners will announ@@ ce their tre@@ aties . &quot;
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina presented by the Chinese company CIT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L is going to continue that the plant will continue to be operated in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , distributed the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the Tre@@ aties called &quot; &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; &quot; should be taken into force on November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ mon@@ ati@@ te cancellation , so that they will end . &quot;
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L goes from that the contracts in the financial year will be contributing to the revenues in the financial year , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forec@@ asts of the strong dead@@ lines for wholesale est@@ rogen .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that there has been the value of the contracts already in his annual closing in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a dism@@ is@@ sal &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book contracts , the &quot; capability Alco@@ as ... the mel@@ ting to operate or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the US @-@ Company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang in force , which should appear in force by November this year , even if there is even an explanation gu@@ il@@ ty , why it is rej@@ ected by the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st war@@ ns due to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Oper@@ ations Stephen My@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land had around 600 Mega@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; Strom@@ market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as an generator would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey from countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the Federal Republic of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are characterized by significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U .
this rel@@ ocation of the opinion of the Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government co@@ alition , in the north barely ra@@ ining it , this is not possible after the in@@ quiries in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD is the stron@@ gest party and could have good chances to continue the government &apos;s government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD of 35,@@ 6 percent ahead of five years ago on 24 percent .
&quot; according to pol@@ l , the party will only be just below the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the Af@@ gh@@ s .
&quot; the left on 19 percent ( before 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 per cent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , despite light losses with 6 percent ( previously mentioned 8,@@ 7 per cent ) back into the Schwer@@ iner Land . &quot;
n@@ p@@ d and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the land .
at the Berlin de@@ pu@@ ties of the SPD the SPD of the survey conducted only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is thus behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 per cent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the de@@ pu@@ ties building .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return the F@@ DP on a return , the pir@@ ates would be mis@@ sed in opposition to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the successor is domin@@ ating today the world - its producers lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost a semi @-@ kil@@ og@@ ram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick@@ er and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck . &quot;
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ abyte to reach today for about two rar@@ ity with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
for a few Euros the devices can still buy the devices still on the internet but they origin@@ ate somehow from the stone &apos;s age of the dormit@@ ory tal@@ es .
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the final cell@@ ular phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the west @-@ free format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser if also stri@@ ving slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available to a digi@@ pack book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be similar to a lap@@ top .
then a small keyboard and an black @-@ white screen .
&quot; pretty proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 392 euros .
nobody was able in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator will become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the kl@@ u@@ gen teleph@@ ones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the phone @-@ board of fin@@ s was an un@@ preced@@ ed dis@@ asters , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
the market domin@@ ates the market today who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
in 2015 there were nearly two billi@@ ons of smartphone users around the world .
&quot; sold have been sold about 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , from it alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
sales revenue generated with the devices at around 400 billion euros .
these are the good ongoing business of the numerous App @-@ providers and tele@@ communication .
around the smartphone is now a whole industry in the meantime .
&quot; the decisive break@@ through to the mass market was first in early 2007 , at the time the Apple Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World The introduction of the iPh@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three tools in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ treat of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who domin@@ ate the market , they had to see . &quot;
they disappear finally , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now we have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its in@@ vention a matter of course .
&quot; in the cut , every Germans now looks for 88 times a day on his phone . &quot;
&quot; we need to learn all , the smartphone even time away , &quot; said just Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens Board of Finance . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a cur@@ se and bl@@ ess@@ ings at the same time .
England needs to raise the olymp@@ ic Spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only used in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , it presented the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we benef@@ ited a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games benef@@ ited . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be re@@ achable by raising funds for local and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row new possibilities .
&quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new apprentic@@ eship , 40.@@ 000 new jobs and to prepare the youth unemployment in the airport . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England never will be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ ame us on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ es were inj@@ ustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ winds but He@@ ath@@ row will answer any of him the question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for single one infra@@ structural project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and to leave a leg@@ acy of abilities and employment to both the airport and in the whole of GB . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion of Infra@@ structure infrastructure in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in consequence to the world @-@ best airport transfer was built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ ests of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we call this olymp@@ ic spirit and he@@ ath@@ row as well as to ensure our future trade and create a leg@@ acy of skills and employment to be proud of the England .

&quot; for companies that deser@@ ve with a liter@@ al money , according to one of the software &apos;s software tests , advertising block to handle , a &quot; kis@@ sing and Maus@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook anch@@ ored that it would block indic@@ ating on his desktop site , published Ad@@ block Plus a blogger that allows users to update their filters in the program to block more publicity in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that his desktop @-@ site would change the co@@ ding on his advertis@@ ements in order to change it , which part of the page advertising is to be revealed . &quot;
but Ad@@ block pro@@ claimed that there has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blogger post the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er &apos;s battle between the in@@ vention of Adver@@ ti@@ sers in the gen@@ us is , and that it is possible to come soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world @-@ largest company has left for social media in the battle , is a strong indic@@ ator that has become wor@@ r@@ ying scor@@ er for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year from Pag@@ ef@@ air , and Adobe around 200 million people display lock@@ ers ; almost four times a lot of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with reaching billi@@ ons daily active users , access to Facebook on their mobile devices , makes handi@@ cap 84 percent of the adverti@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the company has set it on display blocks on Desktop PCs apart , since mobile adverti@@ sers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobil@@ er App for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , distributed a spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenue from so Facebook appears to be the investment of such stri@@ es as worth@@ while .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; indic@@ ative &quot; &quot; indic@@ ator &quot; &quot; would be upgr@@ aded to people more control over it at targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook , that Ad@@ blocks would be new filters wor@@ r@@ ying because they were also block@@ ed content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this does not constitute a positive experience , therefore , we are planning to see the problem , share a spok@@ es@@ man by Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; advertising block are a proud means , which is why we have concentrated instead on develop@@ mental tools such as Ad @-@ Preferences to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;

&quot; it was opened a medi@@ ation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ sec@@ utor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases will show in the last five years that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases , one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers do not assume that a pedestri@@ ans are going on the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted and killed after they had a man flo@@ ck and killed that lay down in August 2014 one night on the A1 close to Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year victims had dr@@ unk , and has become conscious on the road @-@ conscious , and took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court asked that the police offic@@ er had respon@@ ded to a call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predict@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information about the inci@@ dent on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should get in the police at number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 . &quot;
NA@@ SA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once habit@@ able
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA Kli@@ mam@@ od@@ ells , probably habit@@ able . &quot;
scientists at God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms for those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once proved to be un@@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the newest Simulation indicates that the Venus could have a thin , a similar atmosphere and nevertheless slow down . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ated the Top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry parts than the earth , but once had enough water and geo@@ graphic vari@@ ability to make life , and before fast sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ IS@@ S model Simulation exp@@ on@@ ated the slow conversion of the Venus to almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ IS@@ S scienti@@ st Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a Short news . &quot;
&quot; this increases the surface and produces rain , which creates a thickness shift clouds , which makes it possible to complete the surface of a large proportion of the solar heat . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cool@@ ers than that of the earth today are .
the model brought a history of Venus that was res@@ em@@ bles that evolution has been res@@ id@@ ed by Plan@@ etary research .
&quot; although she was once probably un@@ inhab@@ ited , the Venus -- was subj@@ ected to a lot of heat and ultr@@ avi@@ ol@@ ett@@ em . &quot;
your oc@@ eans di@@ min@@ ed and their water@@ mark was burned down by the ultr@@ avi@@ ol@@ ett@@ em light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen dre@@ w , there was only a thickness of carbon dioxide with a fat@@ al greenhouse gas@@ es -- the Venus that as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Cli@@ mati@@ cs in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy gets back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a little co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and mer@@ ged that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , expressed the 50 @-@ year Roy in an opinion . &quot;
I &apos;ve imag@@ ined in the course of the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hockey Oper@@ ations perfectly match the organization . &quot;
it must also have a co @-@ determination to decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had lift@@ ed by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has kept me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded during his deb@@ ut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Ad@@ ams Awards as the best coach of the League .
&quot; he carried out the association on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and mis@@ sed in each of the last few years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches participated in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart won Roy vier Stan@@ ley Cu@@ ps -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers take talks on , putting strings from &quot;
&quot; the labour @-@ struggles for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers are exposed to the table , while all the armed parties are put for a new conversation on the table , said the negotiations . &quot;
stri@@ kes against the oil feld@@ web@@ providers Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ms unions can confirm that we have agreed ourselves to start the dem@@ ise process of the current strike , it is in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep a few days @-@ day meetings during the next weeks , will start the beginning of next year to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their final stroke , which is the first in over 25 years is to be a prot@@ est against possible pay@@ outs of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has abbrevi@@ ated this year to its contr@@ actors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to neg@@ ated market pressure .
the rat@@ ts of the company follows a 10 @-@ process decrease for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market flo@@ oring .
&quot; shell has announced for its part of thousands of people , and set plans to leave his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of his Meg@@ az@@ ing committee with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are based on lower Ro@@ ds under pressure , an economic situation that had to rely on the decision of the British in June , to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scot@@ tish parliament@@ arians Dave Ander@@ son met the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders , to discuss one of the greatest labour disp@@ utes since one generation in the North Sea . &quot;
the North Sea is important for regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few works , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
2016 will be less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion spending for new projects in the North Sea in comparison to average about $ 7 billion in recent five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler mis@@ sed Rot@@ ation rate of stars in star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ teles@@ cope , astronom@@ ers helped to collect the full catalogue of rotation among the stars of the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
the new data help the Astr@@ onom@@ y to understand why stars in star clu@@ des to different races as well as in what context the rotation periods with the plan@@ etary results .
&quot; we hope that we know through the compar@@ ative of our results with other star@@ ry , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ adena , in a Short news . &quot;
the con@@ clu@@ ster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 445 years of light from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ clu@@ des that emerged about 125 million years ago , reaching the adult . &quot;
you turn now on the fast@@ est .
at top @-@ top rates all these three @-@ star quantities of star win@@ ches .
&quot; since these win@@ ches travel through the sol@@ en@@ field of the stars , they have a bre@@ ach effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star altern@@ ates , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow@@ down . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler , the rotation rate of each con@@ stell@@ ation by taking the time between the awak@@ ening of a recogni@@ z@@ able star @-@ flat@@ s -- like sun@@ spots -- recognize . &quot;
the newest catalog of rot@@ ational rates shows that massive stars s@@ lower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with danc@@ ers , with greater stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes are turning than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; &quot; the Ple@@ ven &quot; , we see that slow rot@@ ors to be a massive rot@@ ors to be massive rot@@ ors to be very bright stars &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades in the P@@ lei@@ ades so close is , it serves as ide@@ ales cosme@@ tic laboratory to compare qualities such as Rot@@ ation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ry of the Ple@@ j@@ aden provides an an@@ chor for theore@@ tical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much to tell us about what we want to know more how the How , W@@ ann and Why Stars her Rot@@ ation rates betra@@ yed and so@@ ons her &quot; dance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three times in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ d@@ ads , which will soon be published soon in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ iny@@ i , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ op@@ ing@@ acci@@ dents . &quot;
know : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ sample may not start Wei@@ ght@@ th@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a det@@ ected Athle@@ tin would have been almost a med@@ al .
in front of the seventh competition the Olympic Games became known in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; the Chinese swimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ iny@@ i , 3000 @-@ Meter @-@ Hinder@@ nis@@ hers Adrian Ziel@@ inski were posi@@ tively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the beginning @-@ critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en was already proven the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as mas@@ cul@@ ator funds for d@@ op@@ ing@@ substances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Tribunal CAS confirmed on the morning afternoon their exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old place took place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0,@@ 09 seconds they pass the Bronze Med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the pro@@ visi@@ onal over 50 m of free style . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Test at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Tribunal CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no more the IO@@ C , but the CAS is responsible for the sanctions of the sport@@ s@@ men with positive items . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio si@@ ck@@ ed the news about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went out into the off@@ ensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive . &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; said they said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; you may be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
the report is estimated to act on the substance of the blood of the EP@@ O .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa became a pro@@ visi@@ onal susp@@ ended , according to B@@ NT also the B @-@ sample has already been positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ ari@@ ens Premier Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w joined pro@@ mpt@@ ly with criticism at the Athle@@ tics .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ letes do not draw the right batt@@ les , &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , some of the weight@@ lif@@ ter may not be eligi@@ ble from the chr@@ onic d@@ op@@ ing@@ dist@@ ressing nation not in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was announced in the class up to 85 kg as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested three days before positive on the an@@ abo@@ le Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both before taking the intake , both may not be able to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of light@@ ath@@ letes is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa another serious blow to the Rep@@ utation of the entire sports .
&quot; the I@@ A@@ AF World Association I@@ A@@ AF had allowed the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic d@@ op@@ ings to start , even the consumption of Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the water sports , the earlier occurr@@ ence in China had taken care in China for heavy disp@@ utes arising from the ath@@ letes . &quot;
so close to the Fran@@ zo@@ ic Camil@@ le La@@ court the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang gu@@ elt pur@@ ple . &quot;
&quot; if I see Po@@ dium at 200 m of free style , I want to pass myself , &quot; said La@@ court in French radio . &quot;
sun was also the center of a confront@@ ation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping danc@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;

daten@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de en@@ pres@@ sen hack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programmer of em@@ be@@ ware to be targeted at current companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware @-@ defense of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany have been 40 percent of frag@@ ments companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of a Att@@ ac@@ ke with black@@ mail@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ranking . &quot;
40 percent of victims paid by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors to be able to use the challeng@@ ed systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of speci@@ alis@@ e their invent@@ ory software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; are they successful there , the potenti@@ ally under@@ writing solv@@ ent is clearly higher than at home . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re currently watching a fri@@ ght@@ ening fast evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chef Marc@@ in Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising to advertising .
then we discovered the perpet@@ rat@@ ors software for itself .
&quot; first , individuals were the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking was fri@@ ght@@ ened in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim active , it specifically for un@@ far changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel@@ ent or database files , as well as the archi@@ ving of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustainable .
afterwards the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ er .
&quot; to get the end @-@ turn code to the files , the victim of money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency bit@@ coin - sur@@ round . &quot;
&quot; but where in private use the personal photo database on the game , it goes with companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is still@@ ness . &quot;
accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware sugge@@ sts .
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German firms generated revenue generated by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business . &quot;
&quot; in Germany already several hospitals are victims of attacks , whose patients can be threat@@ ened by the loss of hospital . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : paid not , it thereby promotes only the problem , &quot; &quot; Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies they pay , get their data again . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the position of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study the safety researchers examined by F @-@ Secure the user interfaces and come to the result , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are actually trying to build a kind customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you explain their sacri@@ fic@@ es by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t example files . &quot;
&quot; and become individuals after payments of a few hundreds of Euro , companies must pay hard to negoti@@ ate and to be returned to their data un@@ encryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; given the potenti@@ ally high and relatively ris@@ ik@@ ol@@ osen profits from the ranking , the h@@ acker become more professional and share the work , declared security experts from the An@@ tiv@@ irus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
more likely it is that it is three or four people .
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software design to the actual ore .
&quot; the previous Mal@@ ware @-@ kits emerged by drawing up the mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a custom@@ iz@@ able tool , so that smaller configurations , looks and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ box are then looking for more h@@ acker to spread the fresh and spread the software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; therefore one is log@@ s in one of the forums in the bottom , buy the set of a crimin@@ als and assigned a further to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
payment is made per in@@ fic@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then sei@@ ze sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known with many companies that ensure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies active in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey on this , Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ ers@@ o@@ ftware . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryp@@ tion of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful awak@@ ening more , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors , instead , with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or prize @-@ scal@@ ations , &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Marc@@ in Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the potential potenti@@ als depending on the type of data is still higher than before . &quot;
also the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be completely new goals in the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstr@@ ates how they could get used with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter the release of a der@@ art block@@ ed heating could be so many as many as much as a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then instead of the heating in the future will block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and effective
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda does all pack : a little SU@@ V , a little co@@ upon and also the versati@@ l@@ ity of a Mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new Jazz , pro@@ ves to actually be extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in front of the first row as well as in F@@ ond much space , it does not appear too tight . &quot;
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ side falls apart from there . &quot;
versatile and comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk area of 453 l with high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l used for inver@@ ted back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ drop can be high @-@ fl@@ aps , and thus offer storage space , from the floor up to blan@@ kets 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk area is well maintained , but the loader height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the compar@@ able Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the get@@ ed 1.6 @-@ l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speed ranges very powerful .

two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cont@@ am@@ big@@ uous .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .

better traffic on the motorway
it is regularly updated on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but that is supposed to change : the rect@@ ory bi@@ eg@@ ai@@ pur should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all cars , who stand at the ambi@@ tion road every evening in the st@@ au when they ride over the motorway , Zu@@ id ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the operation road construction is extended on the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right track gauge railway station at 700 meters .
motor@@ cyclists can then be moved directly from the hammer street on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early on giving the total process at the most popular section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U @-@ faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driving distance on the fe@@ eder nervous the mot@@ ori@@ sts mainly between 17 and 7 pm .
&quot; week@@ days , the back@@ seat ranges up to the bridge over the Alb@@ ers@@ lo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle tube on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic will only be out@@ lined over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ built in a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had a result that the bridge has no longer the necessary load , to ab@@ sorb especially the heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long this engagement , and the comp@@ act@@ ory stones will not be said , the constant state can not be said . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been to be expected with years : for the bridge has an official balance duration up to 2034 . &quot;
for the extension of the leg@@ sab@@ bi@@ eg@@ ai@@ pur the provin@@ cial service has deli@@ ber@@ ately sought the traffic weak@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected .
the traffic will be passing on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .

relaxing night : tips for sleeping trou@@ bles
&quot; in the evening , one sees itself eternal , at night , one is st@@ unk at night , in the morning it is far from the ag@@ gaz@@ ing to think more of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but rest@@ ful .
&quot; after all , there is a quarter of adults in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults and more than ten percent emp@@ ire their sleep often or permanent than not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do you have problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different causes under@@ lying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ was , Member of the German Society for dormit@@ ory and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , but is the in@@ som@@ nia , so a inputs and le@@ ak disturb@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; right to sleep , many people find as un@@ satis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the German Haus@@ physician Association with practice in the Dutch Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping trou@@ bles ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or contr@@ actual factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rare is the sle@@ ev@@ ing expression of a different disorder .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is mostly in a depression often , &quot; says We@@ ar . &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
&quot; who for example has a band@@ age fall , can be bad@@ ly lying , awak@@ ens all two to three hours and begins with bl@@ ur@@ able to gre@@ et about all @-@ day problems and to gre@@ et you , there is one example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
starting when one should be with sleeping trou@@ bles to a doctor ?
who over a month of a month at least three nights per week is not well sle@@ eps and affected by the day he ought to go to the doctor .
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is down@@ stairs , tired , un@@ trained , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easy ir@@ rit@@ able , has ton@@ ight or physical dis@@ comfort such as mag@@ nets or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to lin@@ ing the sle@@ eps , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment of treatment , a cog@@ ni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sle@@ eves only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks - in@@ query . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there is hardly , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Laboratory of the Char@@ it@@ é Univers@@ ität@@ smedizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should have any case for sleeping problems at home . &quot;
the problem can be clari@@ fied as if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should come into ad@@ ul@@ sion , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for investigation in the dormit@@ ory medicine , for example by Schn@@ ar@@ chen with breathing exercises , with disease , if you can &apos;t find the cause of a le@@ ak @-@ disorder , or if you do not find the cause of a le@@ ak disturb@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it does not have to prepare for the examination . &quot;
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make lunch @-@ sheep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the sales one goes to his normal time into the bed .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body you carries a nas@@ en@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a f@@ ow@@ ler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; moreover , a camera on the ceiling features the sle@@ eper . &quot;
how can people affected the problems in the grip ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws where you can put for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ el counts on : regular Sle@@ eping and up@@ times , not too long in bed are not sleeping on the day , do not sleep in the watch , alcohol mei@@ den , and at night not at the watch - then we start to be immediately expected , and that is quite in@@ adequate . &quot;
what the jungle camp is missing with missing Med@@ als in swimming .
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ appoint@@ ing the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had fet@@ ched gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler is placed via Facebook @-@ support prior to his criticism of the former ex team .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ans 20,000 € Pre@@ mie gets and an jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0.000 € should not be wonder@@ ing about missing Med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sport be bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controll@@ len is very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries who do so much promote and operate the subject of d@@ oping not so accur@@ ately or it even operate . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eb@@ ack , to be reported Dei@@ bler already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag is arrested
professional Di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; civ@@ ilians of Düssel@@ dorfer police gel@@ ang on Thursday the capture of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years . &quot;
the fact that the fact had been committed as Ban@@ de several T@@ ash@@ - and baggage .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 Uhr , civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang again , which was known to the polic@@ emen of past Di@@ eb@@ stahl@@ si@@ del@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
the two women and two men had been committed to mid July this year and were shared with shared work@@ manship and particularly profession@@ ally .
the specialists of Cri@@ min@@ al@@ com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 may have been submitted to the den@@ om@@ ination of off@@ ences to Germany were four de@@ eds .
&quot; in this case , they had a total of over 15.@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; alt@@ ed houses , a few left @-@ fo@@ aming , between yet another head@@ lights : the Rig@@ id@@ ental street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain appears on the first sight not so , but the police count towards the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; go down the road from east to West , one comes to playground , a re@@ fres@@ co@@ ed nurser@@ y and a bee @-@ shop . &quot;
to the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone is ug@@ ly up ! &quot;
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl that is also to be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; tr@@ endy neighborhood , &quot; as the constant real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called unt@@ ain in the last weeks of being illustr@@ ated with burning vehicles . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants have been occupied , on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; especially the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had been working for a hard approach of the police against the project as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the spaces located on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 polic@@ emen were cle@@ ared up with 30 to 40 officials and three teams , parts of the road and kept visitors of it , the house with the number 94 to enter . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the renovated construction workers in order of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court rul@@ ed that the clearance was illegal , and a day later moved the police and buil@@ ders under the gem of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and owners . &quot;
&quot; in this morning , the street peaceful : parents are going to walk with children , people sit on the civil descent ahead of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects are a basic school and kindergart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main orge of many coun@@ ties : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived since 1999 in pine and Jana * , who played here three children , especially from the police offic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern before rising ten@@ ets and g@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not like after a p@@ z , who is defin@@ ite pol@@ emic against v@@ andal@@ ent left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police between the owners and their neigh@@ b@@ ors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Ber@@ lins was actually a traditional worker @-@ quarter , which also has a minimum of average transit and high poverty . &quot;
&quot; the owners , and those of the born housing projects belong for a long time to p@@ ines : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the whole Main@@ land road very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ land had been se@@ aled under a regular basis in a regular basis , many of the projects were leg@@ alized within the arms and are still inhab@@ ited by the people who were occupied before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the past few years has become increasingly the mag@@ nets of tourists and campaigns from all over the world : with them now puri@@ fier of the G@@ DR times and former house@@ keeping their pine trees . &quot;
&quot; this also seems to be noted in the ten@@ ets , which has ris@@ en almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new constructions in the Rig@@ h@@ ī@@ f are attacked as symbols for this development : they det@@ ects them in the dis@@ closed dis@@ cs or fresh@@ ed fac@@ ades that were thro@@ wn with sh@@ ades .
no other street was mentioned as often along with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neigh@@ b@@ ors could be seen as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality such as body infr@@ ing@@ ement , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest portion of the off@@ ences make sense , the ten@@ den@@ ell sooner rather the new constructions and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living for 17 years in a house next to the cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ al 94 , can be no talk of un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; resulting from violence , it is protective : the people in 94 are their neighbours , which shall not be determined . &quot;
even the famous burning vehicles give it directly in the Rig@@ idity no longer .
&quot; for the studied architecture is not a crime item , on the contrary , &quot; here you can help each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deli@@ ber@@ ately moved into the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore it was so important that the inhabitants get off their street : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through sight@@ ed new constructions in former buildings , which push@@ ed the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately condom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well preserved , &quot; says them . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I have absolutely not gu@@ thei@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what can you do , if one never any someone listen ? &quot;
&quot; here on all sides fru@@ stration , also with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for wake @-@ up , Kerstin was anno@@ ying about farms , Kerstin has little understanding : the front @-@ projects and the left scene belongs to the p@@ ines . &quot;
who her@@ ds that should be aware - just like som@@ eb@@ ody who is in a pub neighborhood there is bad over noise .
&quot; all of the names have provided by name , not called to be called with their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ ator .
&quot; in addition , she is social work on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le the refuge@@ e for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical supports the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a response to all players : refugees , working of refuge@@ e , administration , authorities and who else f@@ ails . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer of the work that indicates that the ehr@@ ens are more than grateful that De@@ us@@ ht@@ le is now da is the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au that has mainly a problem .
&quot; so , some - less spot@@ ting as rather on the multitude of desired tasks areas ab@@ domin@@ ating - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; were looking for a administrative associate with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
but administrative work is not its central area , um@@ t Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all , it is about organisation , work with the people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as a network . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot over three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le schol@@ ar and soci@@ alisation actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the W@@ as@@ enstra@@ ße area
&quot; a he@@ arth of the problem has been found for some time , apartments for the connection leaf , have been recognized . &quot;
for the rati@@ fication are the municipalities .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented housing .
the cost of construction that rent or restoration of these accommodations must carry the Commun@@ e itself .
the responsibility changes from the land@@ rat to commun@@ e and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to finds the administration of any private apartments .
&quot; it has not been working yet to be dependent on private apartments , so de@@ us@@ sel@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we need to be shared apartments , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers will be placed in the W@@ as@@ enstra@@ ße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le include . &quot;
&quot; in addition to strong pen@@ cils there are practic@@ ed ships , apprentic@@ es , school courts , a @-@ euro jobs and foreign policy for refugees and migrants who must take up or be furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; tells Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ yard or help house@@ wives , done char@@ itable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le reports . &quot;
they hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive influence .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not only work .
&quot; the day you need a fixed structure , saying , De@@ us@@ ht@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop an related feeling .
&quot; so we need offers such as sports , contacts with local and especially courses . &quot;
professional courses are rar .
&quot; so , we also jump here administration and volunte@@ er . &quot;
it is central that refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must declare the refugees , that it will take it and they can re@@ produce the time for example , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who some@@ time to help the feeling that he cannot work in Ur@@ bach anyone , may not work and be unn@@ ütz , which will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority was motiv@@ ated .
&quot; but there are also , says customer honest@@ ly , &quot; people , at all nothing goes . &quot; the work of De@@ us@@ ht@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; m@@ amm@@ ing task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two according to the recent advanc@@ ement , fear of radi@@ c@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher na@@ ï@@ ve may be called . &quot;
sensi@@ tis@@ es the help@@ ers were already .
these inci@@ dents are also on the subject of refugees .
they are the fear that the attacks are completely put into con@@ fer@@ red .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , principal and volunte@@ er must keep in front of the spot and in the region after its activities . &quot;
&quot; in the background , they always have a new back@@ ward for refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to face them up on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes a clear that the Ur@@ bacher also are already sim@@ ulated that the Ur@@ bacher are already r@@ acted to the previous person .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they have to help them both women are one @-@ ig . &quot;
&quot; the political world is so complicated , there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for hel@@ icopter with hel@@ icop@@ ters
the police stro@@ kes fle@@ w approximately one hour long several areas - un@@ successful .
&quot; two unknown men are revealed in the open @-@ day tomorrow against 8.50 o &apos;clock , and penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot;

&quot; the two men were approximately 1,@@ 65 to 300 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , tru@@ cking both Blue@@ jeans and black Hoo@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
they fle@@ ed towards the city centre .
&quot; on the flag , the police sat down several strings as well as a pol@@ ishing gland . &quot;
the f@@ riction ran out without success .
&quot; probably , the unknown to the apartment was indeed close to the apartment and on its escape . &quot;
