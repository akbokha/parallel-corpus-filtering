<seg id="2">Lonely men with middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you tell for the comment, in order to miss him under the pseudonym non-leonage group with rauen, this statement leads to current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov is the multiplication of sound boards not on a Boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the curiosity of physical objects, but on Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who have recently bought a plate, are all precaution at the age of 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most probable sound-group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collector - it has an emotional meaning: older record runner (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend your time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would follow a news report on TV, I would follow myself in the midst of a bustling road in Soho, before I steer, my hands will be kept and something determinant as:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart Sohos is slowly placed at his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill out the buildings where once independent sellers were settled - there are still a handful fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part, within walking distance to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (data count: eight young women, three men middle age), a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes by shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm already wondering," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound boards, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by e), clides the walls of his dwelling."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford to buy them, when he sold and was sold again, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I bought are from the late 60s, early 70s who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably something to young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees to buy that those who are buying, rather introverted and like to spend their time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't smoke very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my loaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"GMT, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers, which he meets the YouGov's Profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he also noticed a new wave to people who heard about the Medienhpe, people who heard about the comeback and let yourself be seen again to buy their old plates."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the talks, which I have led, people usually did so about 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates now.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in trailers of the turntable of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the appropriate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds to a business like Phonica to acknowledge that record stores a soothing community of equinninned.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers have participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted soundproofes, from objects, the happier juices guarded. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of the posal owners as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collectors and I think that there is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" "flavored a staff of one record stacks."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April, that almost 50% of the people have purchased a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who own a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news, I would probably look very concerned while I refer by a stacked to Bossa Nova Comfortations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Datasheets: three men middle age) works, has a" "trophy" "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"somebody came only recently and said:" I am not a turntable, but I would like to buy a radio head, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a large percentage, but it happens definitely."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-bearing, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, which only slowly come."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated to sound boards nearly one whole floor, has a blower audience, when I am."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, - Wild Beast neuester synthesizer and right-wing Pop instead of experimental jazz instead of the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sonderly lonely lonely, but the mental psychmata are hard to detectable if you stand beside someone over thirty seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs for some minutes in the shop and considers the varies of the sale available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It has more of a shovel bummel as a big board.</seg>
<seg id="50">"you don't deserve a lot, so the collectors of records is not a real option, says she."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives with a lover Seufzer. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, from which is said that a new generation of equilibrium have to be inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the attack, the jeans hotap into Musters, watching a group of young teenager to grouping for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a crosley-player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it in - perhaps because they are merely purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grip them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turntables."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these objects mean more money for the sector mean and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury homes such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my post-research had vote that the results of YouGov agree, let them at least in turnaround in Soho, the large number of female collectors and turntables who exist in reality, and in Onlineate."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with Bummbling along the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while in the staring sight of an unbeatable, 30-year-false Moderator, who flake about the shoulders of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters the political changes in Ethiopia demand the resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the forty protesters were killed during clashes with the police at Schussr.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking down?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the stable countries of Africa, a solid banded of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last few months, protests against the government the country and more widespread in over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week's thousands of people on the streets and slowest fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was noisy to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave that the policemen on zig unarmed protesters and baptism.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in addition to the protest videos about the protests, which probably come from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety of young people are forced with punching, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Convention for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this land and will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Project manager of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most abundant country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American army and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopian authorities to fight terrorist over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy is expanding in the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new roof-suit in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations, the oppression against the government has been restricted - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dispresidents were effectively applied to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent to exile or in prison, killed or into the madness of the desert. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, this could change."</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and those no other options have to protest out, breaks it off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil use up to the throwing in terms of power of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a blended choice last year, the rule of the party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these zackable, umversial line called for June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-clear front or the National Liberal front of the Ogaden, which could be more or less forced to protect the turbulence and once again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitternation after years of before proceeding before the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in the last few years ago, very much Ethiopian has been able to communicate with social media, since cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government initiates access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, do many people still communicate via internet-proxies, where they can hold."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian gave that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Orocosmos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orocosmos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since equities the Amharas, which come from the eththopause of the Aegean Sea, in politics and economy, while taking the Orocosmos, of which many Muslims are living and in flat-regions."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a shield," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Orocosmos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have dominantly dominates that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that are about six percent of the population and the military service, in the intelligence and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former vine leader, was up to his death on a non-known disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly sealed in it was to make early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special requests to edit opponents and make them irharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking on this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected to accept the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tights region NordäEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia lived such a rebellion, in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested by the government of analyzers and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following sweeps were killed many protesters, even though it were less than in the last few months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts commenced the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructures, as well as the new pendleral train, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty abdomination."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this is not the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month attacks protesters in Gondar, a amharsh town, of Tigray-guided shops and the hate towards the Tigray is always in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests of the USA and other western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for emergency flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently remembered that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West to support democracy, he does not want to support its allies in a fully volatilen region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this" "said Mr. Abdi," is a very thin ridge. "</seg>

<seg id="9">This of long-loneliness discounted lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, at any rate of an Freilandhai, the 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity", commented Alexander Scheuerlein by Max Planck-Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this way of life, which means for spine a world balance. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist has long been stressing that Greenlandhaie will be staged."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenlandhaie are difficult to observe, lastly, they live mainly in the ice-sea before the thin coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius, they dive at the surface mostly only in winter. "</seg>

<seg id="19">Possibly coincidentally they sleeping animals or patrouiling on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cadaver which consist of higher water-stories according to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are subject to 28 Greenlandhaie the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a committing from the depth of the nordatantiks.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters, while the largest gold centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, analyzed them with the carbon-14-method the linsencore of the hair."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelids arises already before the birth of the sharks, which contained therein contained in it is no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest hair had a striking much carbon-14 in the left corner.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapon attempts greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimeters length of third animal, the left-hand performs a low level of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>

<seg id="29">"that Greenlandshark can only get offspring if they are longer than four metres, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could arrange an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals have been determined with 392 centimeters, at the threshold of lovemaking, and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenlandhaie with the multiplication obviously at least one-half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be the world-tremble for whirlwind.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in heated waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenlandwal, in its speck in the Neck a 120 years old Harpoenspitze, was caught in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is therefore later - and almore slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep in the cold water warm, the animals also often become especially large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, thanks to the animal heat. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram is therefore much greater than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible."</seg>

<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware-defense of Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany have been 40 percent of fragments companies in the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of a Attacke with blackmailers."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ranking."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators of specialise their inventory software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"are they successful there, the potentially underwriting solvent is clearly higher than at home."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we're currently watching a frightening fast evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising to advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, individuals were the goal, but the change to company attacking was frightened in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim active, it specifically for unfar changed files such as Word-, Excelent or database files, as well as the archiving of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards the software presents the demands of the blackmailer.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-turn code to the files, the victim of money - usually in the form of cryptocurrency bitcoin - surround."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private use the personal photo database on the game, it goes with companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is stillness."</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German firms generated revenue generated by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany already several hospitals are victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospital."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: paid not, it thereby promotes only the problem," "Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies they pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the position of the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study the safety researchers examined by F-Secure the user interfaces and come to the result, the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and become individuals after payments of a few hundreds of Euro, companies must pay hard to negotiate and to be returned to their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risikolosen profits from the ranking, the hacker become more professional and share the work, declared security experts from the Antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware around within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software design to the actual ore.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous Malware-kits emerged by drawing up the malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a customizable tool, so that smaller configurations, looks and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailbox are then looking for more hacker to spread the fresh and spread the software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"therefore one is logs in one of the forums in the bottom, buy the set of a criminals and assigned a further to install the software on as many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inficated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then seize spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known with many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies active in the Malwarebytes survey trust in the Malwarebytes survey on this, Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful awakening more, the perpetrators, instead, with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or prize-scalations," explained Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"with this, the potential potentials depending on the type of data is still higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">Also the perpetrators could be completely new goals in the internet of things.</seg>
