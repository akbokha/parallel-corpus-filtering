&quot; the details published by the agent on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who said him , helped to add a picture of a tal@@ ented , but perhaps difficult teachers to draw . &quot;

8 En@@ quiries that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to convert him as a flo@@ p .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper R@@ ings in Poll@@ s down , it has not worked ( nor ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national sur@@ veys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some start to ask yourself what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is too early in the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure .
none claims that Tru@@ mp probably will gain the re@@ publi@@ que nom@@ ination .
experts emph@@ asi@@ ze that at that time in 2011 Rick per@@ r@@ ys guidance on the rising Herman C@@ ain was given to whom not only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice .
but external sei@@ sm@@ s like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conserv@@ ative economic group Club for Growth now realize Tru@@ m@@ ps through stamina and start to leave their dollar to precip@@ itate him .
here are some current ra@@ ining indicated that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ m@@ ps Pop@@ thei@@ sts have reached by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp its candi@@ d@@ ur in mid June , showed a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University that showed only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans to real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until the middle of July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
&quot; a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa , last week has established that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
two thir@@ ds of the GO@@ P GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week told 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be short@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say , they would be &quot; an@@ gry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; v@@ s. 40 per cent that tell the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; &quot; an@@ gry &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ can@@ er sees Tru@@ m@@ ps Temper@@ ament does not appear as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely considered for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ low statements , 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans pol@@ ishing vot@@ ers that the real temper@@ ament for a president have , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pre @-@ state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , that he has the personality for a thig@@ h , but loud Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to perform effectively , and say almost six of 10 inde@@ pen@@ alty that his temper@@ ament is not passive house , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can wo@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they en@@ force their schol@@ ars , maintain re@@ publi@@ can@@ ese w@@ ells Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
if they are asked who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination to say according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four of ten end of July their money took on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers had not the clear cryst@@ all@@ ots in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that he would win P@@ erry the nom@@ ination would win compared to only 28 % for the final candidates in Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ stock@@ ed Tru@@ m@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans gather around another candidates , the Tru@@ mp is still almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the frag@@ ment@@ ed field probably contributes to Tru@@ m@@ ps guidance during the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support to more than a do@@ zen of other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp the mostly support . &quot;
&quot; he has written prior to Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points of departure , especially Wal@@ ker 15 points , prior to J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally off edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would exc@@ eed the ent@@ repren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a kn@@ itted majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans say that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only somewhat more than half of the vot@@ ers , the Tru@@ mp support that they have given their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say , never the opinion to change . &quot;
46 percent happ@@ ily that they leave the door to be open to another candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ m@@ ps is stronger competition at the moment of other external sei@@ zed , the neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who they say that they have their mind are twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tru@@ mp in his elect@@ oral friend in front of two months of immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; was the immigration and age point in public dis@@ course to 2016 . &quot;
&quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expres@@ sions of Tru@@ mp is decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party , and the re @-@ oriented efforts will be embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l of Monday say six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans , that they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration in the spot@@ light remains , it will seem to do Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government compl@@ ains on new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of re@@ publi@@ can laundry , above all due to its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they would prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also an@@ gry to Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks reveals that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans over the re@@ public@@ er in Congress are fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied and 21 percent . &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
Zwei@@ f@@ acher Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a happ@@ ier hit by Thomas Müller opened the FC Bayern , road to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran . &quot;
a sover@@ eign el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze made the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel to Piraeus a dream@@ start into the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record Master pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves to 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in Serie shall be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola at last finally get to the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received in his 28@@ th hit in the Champions League for the Champions League for Bavaria leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused one as a f@@ lange code of the world master . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ es@@ timate it , &quot; had Bavaria captain before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ kak@@ is St@@ adion before the game of the Kar@@ ais@@ ha fans - and the Mün@@ chner succ@@ eeded . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and motiv@@ ated performance without g@@ lossy .
&quot; Piraeus had won his recent six be@@ aters in the king@@ class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 st@@ ol@@ per@@ te here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; however , the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els have defe@@ ated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went mu@@ tig on his off@@ ensive efforts but often too mani@@ fest .
the attacks have often been led by toys to Lin@@ ks@@ outside Dou@@ glas Costa domin@@ ate against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i rare .
Müller had more happiness than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ box in the left upper door@@ way .
in the 67@@ . minute the world master gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown the head of Poland from the line hit ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct the door@@ man , the go@@ alie Roberto with the kne@@ e par@@ ked ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arian has moved her to domin@@ ate game , we could re@@ create n@@ adel@@ ein@@ che . &quot;
on go@@ ali@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er was abandoned .
so than he made a sn@@ ake of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te di@@ str@@ e ( 56@@ th ) .
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ ab@@ a in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , according to mus@@ cular problems back in the pool , first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup did not have given after the final date green light , told sports project by Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already vic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; even when the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the weak@@ ened Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still put a dr@@ on . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly conc@@ eal@@ ed Bavaria fans in her audience , evi@@ d@@ ently the fol@@ lowers of hosts re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures pro@@ vo@@ ke , attacked the security forces and went against the Mün@@ chner trailer . &quot;
at least a Bavaria fan was wo@@ und@@ ed from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ g , has a higher risk to lose teeth . &quot;
&quot; who is smo@@ ked , therefore not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er Lang@@ time stages . &quot;
the good news : with compar@@ es the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth .
this goes forth from the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute of Nutri@@ tion Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking , there was risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely for the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had been observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major door for dent@@ ures of c@@ aries , c@@ aries and in@@ flamm@@ ation of the gu@@ m , emphas@@ iz@@ es the DI@@ F@@ E . &quot;
for these par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis is smoking a risk factor than emph@@ asi@@ ze the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go on pre@@ cau@@ tions of fl@@ esh@@ y disorders .
not be clari@@ fied that smoking also increases the risk for tooth dec@@ ay .
&quot; people who died with smoking , could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it could last over ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ rich sin@@ ke , initial shar@@ eholder Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; they have to convince people of it , non @-@ smokers , the leader of H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ F@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot;
&quot; not too smoke is good for l@@ ungs and vessels , and leads to our findings also to a good dental health at a high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population affected by 65 to 74 years of dentistry , the DI@@ F@@ E are concerned . &quot;
earlier studies have already been pointed out that smoking is the risk for early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ stands the findings .

&quot; to the shar@@ p@@ ation of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission proposed an extensive re@@ forming of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the cont@@ ro@@ versi@@ al private cabinets for disp@@ utes between companies and states should be dis@@ solved by a transparent system , which corresponds clearly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system which sub@@ str@@ ate the citizens , &quot; said the EU Commissioner @-@ Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ strö@@ m to the performance . &quot;
the sw@@ ed@@ in has adopted the proposal as a European negoti@@ ation position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is to be the largest free trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings refer@@ ring that the EU countries and the US choose jointly independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot;
they are to be of equal parts from the EU to the US and third countries .
the first time is provided for the first time .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; so far , the procedures participating among each other on arbit@@ rat@@ ors , a bub@@ ble against their jud@@ g@@ ments were not . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , citizens have become clearly that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness is not familiar , commented Malm@@ strö@@ m . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , she wants to work according to its own information on an International Economic Con@@ stitu@@ tional Court . &quot;
there you could also be clari@@ fied as an example between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the most import@@ ed investor @-@ state ship@@ ments ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration will be cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , over the company damages the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws of au@@ spices , or lo@@ wering of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act respon@@ ded to the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot;
cri@@ tic@@ ised is above all that they are not intended for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic sta@@ ats@@ secret@@ ary Matthias Mach@@ i ( SPD ) describes the plans on the other as big progress .
&quot; the Commission considered significant points when reform is essential points , the Federal Ministry of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU @-@ trade discipl@@ ines have been working . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration will be of the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ strö@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European corporation of B@@ US@@ IN@@ ESS@@ EURO@@ PE war@@ ned that the cl@@ are Opport@@ unities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot;
&quot; for small and medium @-@ sized companies , they could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it . &quot;
when the talks on the free trade agreements TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday further un@@ clear .
the negotiations are run since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of Invest@@ ors has not been discussed with the US in so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is not considered more durable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ü@@ t at the question of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ü@@ t is expected at the frag@@ ments of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Day Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n is to put his deb@@ ut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance from the media probably and the Labour parliament@@ arians will be assess@@ ed . &quot;
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ pped some sessions around her colleagues .
this meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership because she comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ar@@ etts to his speech on the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Chairman , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ens of the National hy@@ m@@ ne at a com@@ memor@@ ative ceremony to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence to res@@ ume criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , and is at the central of several title Stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns deci@@ des not singing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attr@@ acted attention to itself
&quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he had been &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he had recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air dr@@ eight around England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ abin@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told , in the BBC Two News @-@ night program , he did sing the Labour @-@ chairman , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; by his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a do@@ zen of shad@@ ows have been den@@ ied to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excellence , and they refer you to differences in economics , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a six@@ teen of the parliamentary party it originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences emer@@ ge within the Labour Party &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements to the position of the European Union and the limit in the respect . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes make changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions ministers , that the party &apos; very clear &apos; be that they only decrease against the government plans to reduce the bo@@ unds of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the 5th Labour Day , David Cameron , since then he is T@@ ory leader in the last decade above the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Party leader who promised to another politicians , says that he gave &quot; &quot; genre &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.@@ 000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ington North MP is said that the frag@@ ments of the Prime Minister is to be confront@@ ed , and that he has made both &quot; &quot; per@@ cep@@ tible &quot; &quot; and that he has made both &quot; &quot; war@@ dness &quot; &quot; and that he has made themselves to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economics , if he is not taking part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea to talk that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the Word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the Spe@@ aker of the house , I talked to the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is linked from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; cas@@ per@@ le theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked with the question of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he was sp@@ ain@@ ted that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent last year 1990 on TV , the ques@@ tioning presented with the Prime Minister as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the origin@@ ator and his position in the Unter@@ haus , and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although the cri@@ tics had been argu@@ ed , and regre@@ t the leaders of the reforms . &quot;

that percentage was the fast@@ est since 2009 and was reported at the time of an interest rate .
&quot; the Po@@ und increased by more than 1 % compared to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 0,@@ 84 % compared to the euro at 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase in 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .

&quot; since then , in his shop turns a grill plat@@ el@@ ß , which has been fitted with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ity for the stomach , &quot; said Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea emerged in the Leb@@ an@@ ese in the meantime at the trial of the Pat@@ ent@@ amt in Munich .
&quot; there , according to the authority of the authority has recently been protected as a manual for use . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much of potatoes are included , Al@@ h@@ ay will not reve@@ al . &quot;

Met@@ alli@@ cash starts floor campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - immigration
met@@ als tries to protect Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ als in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ z has started a ground @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia will be prepared next year , strengthening met@@ als and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets personal relations with local food suppliers and marketing through social media services , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
Ig@@ A dealer and supplier jump on board with brands such as Eis@@ ser Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ borough which distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops re@@ hear@@ s@@ als and shop @-@ owner who sell to the South Australian Broad@@ casting on faithful clients .
&quot; it will expect a further details of its defense strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for foodstuffs , alcohol and equipment per@@ forms its annual investors . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ retail , and higher pay@@ ers as a met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A network in the Baltic states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ ases in South Australia and Western Australia include a much stronger market share in South Australia , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Western Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ sts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states , and all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
one in this week &apos;s report assess@@ ed the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A retail@@ er 360 million revenue per year and met@@ als $ 250 million until the end of 2016 could lose .
this pro@@ gn@@ osis is based on assum@@ ption that Al@@ di launches 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and get sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in every market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities of met@@ cas@@ hs high fix@@ tures could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time met@@ als market share in the east states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ Run@@ ner the faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes turnover in food and food store by 3.8 percent in 2016 and 2.9 percent in 2018 in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week told the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business in Melbourne , that met@@ als will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
metast@@ asi@@ ze it from public to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it will pass that a member of Met@@ als with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contact has been added .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has been de@@ clin@@ ed by 18 percent to 14 percent in 2010 , and made income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trading , which is about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retail@@ er , which is reflected in 2012 by 43 percent , which reflects the operational debt level of turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ alers are hon@@ ored to emplo@@ y more than 150 million dollars for sales trips with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ tes with hundreds of products every week at the improvement of their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver better selection of private food products . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs main business leaders , Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price of prices can be set to Elan and hopes that the wholesale distributors will be back for the first time in the year 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves better praise than criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the Ko@@ lat@@ er@@ al@@ ash@@ den &quot; in the recent storm round about his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves better praise as criticism of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise as criticism of his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger generation of tal@@ ented Du@@ os that is always designated as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; led by the rep@@ aired examination of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka near Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a f@@ ier@@ y quali@@ fying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after they had to be separated from Har@@ rison , and his opponent will have to strike through the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , with Har@@ rison , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen as he was a tennis bat , after a cr@@ y , a potential US Open @-@ win of Richard Gas@@ quet has been ver@@ ted , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended from He@@ aly . &quot;
the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow to compete with Sam Gra@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup of Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I rather ru@@ bles , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was taken a little in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken up a r@@ ack@@ ets , when he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beh@@ ave in the US Open extremely well , even among the rather prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around you , and I believe it became a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a lot of 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is doing so hard , he is good in form , he is a very stur@@ dy and well @-@ mature young guy , and I believe it deserves to be judged on his own business services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gi@@ os that begins on Friday which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ sen around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe , Nick was very quickly the A@@ scen@@ sion , which gets what he gets in the eyes of the public ; and he has ris@@ en to support him , I try to think him the consequences of his actions , I consider it for appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explained Not@@ ion , clos@@ es the border , keeping refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the Emer@@ gency and ri@@ egel@@ ed the south &apos;s border with Serbia on Tuesday and held every firm , illegal in the country to come . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants recorded in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Ser@@ bian officials with emp@@ t@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; people who fled before violence , thre@@ aded for an unknown period in a rural , on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and placed tents , and left there . &quot;
but fru@@ str@@ ations pul@@ ling .
&quot; as a polic@@ emen via them , the migrants &apos; opened the border ! &quot; and sm@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman policy . &quot;
some proved from prot@@ est foods and water back .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens &apos;s Foreign Minister , it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants would be back from Hungary to learn more and more in Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral .
&quot; it must take place in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ bul@@ ence at the hung@@ arian @-@ Ser@@ bian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block with a strict meeting in Brussels made no common immigration policy .

&quot; but Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has passed that most of the coming economic migrants are seeking a better life , and not war leaf that are eligi@@ ble for protection - a view that is strong in contradiction to other EU countries , including Germany , stands . &quot;
&quot; the new laws created by mid@@ night in Hungary in force , make the crossing of the border or the compl@@ aint of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us who settled the government along the southern border to Serbia on a crime . these laws also lay higher adhesi@@ on for non @-@ shared human traffic@@ kers . &quot;

election : hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons Vor@@ sprung before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former U.S. Foreign Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton receives a two dig@@ its leader in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie wins its opposite to the ground .
&quot; Clinton receives support of 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers during the pres@@ idential elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet pro@@ claimed , whether he is responsible for the pres@@ idential and receives support of 15 percent of democratic counter@@ s of the pres@@ idential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the pres@@ idential elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is about what candidates they support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons Supp@@ er are being af@@ firm@@ ed in their election as those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton receives in a number of dem@@ ographic groups , while S@@ anders have achieved some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton receives a big advantage in women and vegetables , but this j@@ umps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men is much s@@ unken , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic score under 50 years has become tr@@ aded ; and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton is still a big advantage with the older laundry .
&quot; last month , Clinton had stood before S@@ anders with two dig@@ its in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections are widely saying that they would support with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some preferences and more 15 per cent would only support because they would be the candi@@ d@@ ine .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current suppor@@ ters are mainly enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger than those that would like to support Clinton - only about one quarter would aid it .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election say that they would support us with enthusiasm , they tell less re@@ publi@@ graphic vot@@ ers these over its sh@@ red@@ head . Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ t suppor@@ ters are asked in an open issue , why they want it the candi@@ d@@ ine is the most common experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clin@@ t Supp@@ orts also raises its connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval for dealing with problems and weighing is also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President represents the potential for the pres@@ idential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ shell , 57 per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election have to see him in the race - although a third believe it should not be done . &quot;
&quot; if democratic vot@@ ers are asked to be asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s fol@@ lowers say more than half , that Bi@@ de@@ vil would be far before S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; deci@@ des that does not decide for the nom@@ ination of dem@@ ocr@@ ats , hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons Vor@@ sprung before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in competitions on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers meet Clinton as a candi@@ d@@ at@@ ine with the best opportunities to win the choice ; however , this number of 78 percent are de@@ clin@@ ed in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; elected &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , in the question afterwards , what is more important when a Candi@@ date is called democratic vot@@ ers questions about the elect@@ or@@ ability . &quot;
similar to the last month is not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates create good results with some important features of choosing the pre @-@ elections of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ds as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; cuts in the three candidates best starting at honest@@ y , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ olog@@ ically in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers has no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; as questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external Prime Minister , most of the Democratic representatives of the pres@@ idential elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected overall . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation for about one third .
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans say that the e @-@ mail cont@@ ro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent spoke that their opinion is det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 that they say , that their views from Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy of their party as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voting rights they do not hold for honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ oral nation@@ als too far also Tru@@ mp is not honest and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp is good notes with leadership .
&quot; by the six tested candidates in Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority looks different rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many no opinion of him . &quot;
the bug@@ fixes for the sample re@@ hear@@ sal of 351 Democratic washing machine in the pres@@ idential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s back on nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp on
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times tight behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; due to the two candidates the half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dram@@ atically on stage . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers still support Tru@@ mp in great numbers . support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted in the Fox News debate last month to be 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son grab@@ bed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey conducted also that Car@@ son can be well stock@@ ed by dem@@ ographic groups well and Tru@@ mp under re@@ publi@@ can laundry with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ os , is be@@ aten by Wis@@ cons@@ in Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Scott Wal@@ ker , who is most sought after 10 % support over the last month . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur J@@ eb Bush , the former govern@@ or von Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % in the third place . &quot;
the error mar@@ gin in the samp@@ ling of 376 persons from Republi@@ can laundry in this latest survey is Plus or min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , the last week was released , shows that Car@@ son desc@@ ends into the sur@@ veys - it land@@ ed at 19 % support for the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one in the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ logical Ophthalm@@ ologist , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tru@@ m@@ ps faith in question . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood be charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years , after a student during a co@@ smo@@ ked rit@@ u@@ als of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an intro@@ duct@@ ory rit@@ ual , and del@@ ayed his transport to hospital , which has contributed to his death , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said , he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeat@@ edly made , while he tried to go through a fro@@ zen field to a destination . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g sound finally about head@@ aches ; then it fell un@@ conscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood does not call the emer@@ ge number 911 to Den@@ g , and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact the symptoms of goo@@ fy and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ other@@ hood , said pol@@ y Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , utens@@ ils to hide and put the good of the Br@@ other@@ hood on principle over by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Pol@@ rad@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not re@@ vi@@ ved and he died on the next morning to his inj@@ uries .
after an auto@@ op@@ o@@ gue Den@@ g repeat@@ edly be repeated with st@@ ump power inj@@ uries to head , trunk and thig@@ hs . &quot;
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Sch@@ ik@@ anen of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table with account and this step of authorities is very important .
an County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indi@@ ct@@ ment because of the third gr@@ ades for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ eight members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indi@@ cted for the attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be held responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially , or un@@ official - this also de@@ emed to account , &quot; said Wagner to a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national rup@@ ture has re@@ vo@@ ke its belonging to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the f@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an adver@@ t is coming , and the hous@@ ings will come into the W@@ aver for bonds , and the economy is going to rec@@ ession into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will take and how long it will maintain .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only small guidance on the process . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ ession came within just 11 months after the first z@@ ins@@ ing increase , and lasted for 86 months . &quot;
&quot; the ag@@ gressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on the raising of interest rates is often , though not always , one factor here , such as the economy and financial investments . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Represent@@ atives of the US Central Bank so intense st@@ ressed that investors should not focus on how it starts to raise interest rates but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; at the end of the market , market participants could find that the whole excitement of a t@@ inser@@ tion may possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the initial increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; endor@@ se money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal places , but still on a low level to get to sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a focus on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could respond :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ing of land@@ ing things can make things for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase has been met , the influence is not so dram@@ atically . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to exc@@ eed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , what may again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ sts in a newer study what happened after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in more precise , the market in the past 35 years most often in the up@@ wards - about 14 per cent - on the way to the part@@ ing increase , fairly flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2,@@ 6 per cent ) , then back to the current analysis , the Bob Doll , Chief Council of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will occur later in the increasing cycle of the increasing cycle and the ren@@ dering that begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but ex@@ haus@@ tion they often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed are confront@@ ed with some conditions which could not be before and can accelerate the rec@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; most remarkable is this , that the bro@@ od @-@ condition has been close to its low@@ est score at a t@@ inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal diameter since 1950 to nomin@@ ate rated G@@ DP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 at 3,@@ 6 percent was expecting only a few that this is growing and expect the third quarter following the At@@ lanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; cases in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question whether this is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the market participants have made the whole year on a t@@ inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many str@@ ate@@ urs and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the F@@ UT@@ U@@ RES @-@ trade deals only a prob@@ ability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increasing cir@@ cli@@ des from 1950 to present in a super @-@ cycle with increasing vibration through the B@@ IP , and on @-@ Rec@@ essi@@ on@@ are very fast set after the start of recovery in the shadow &quot; , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is an un@@ clear recovery from what the worst rec@@ ession in the wat@@ ched phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the lon@@ gest , which has been awa@@ ited the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and these have so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market takes an indication , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares , if its strategic course will change . &quot;
at bonds the ren@@ dering show the direction to change once the first increase / reduction in the cycle is carried out .
&quot; at the end of the increases @-@ cycle , the attack lasted immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ ate@@ gen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates would result in closer , g@@ aps between leng@@ thy and shorter bonds . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds are often used in such an climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ iel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ sti@@ n at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , argu@@ ed Jones , that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy @-@ expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in the domestic maintenance , there are several indications that the market has adapted to more str@@ ing@@ ent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates increased , the yield , gran@@ ules have ris@@ en out and the vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity has ris@@ en - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole host companies that will be involved in the larger part of their business operations in the United States , of which interest rates and local products attr@@ active . &quot;
M@@ ultin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts are worse than a rising dollars of their products on the global market is more expensive and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares must tend to act three months after an initial condition of this &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have a strong balance sheet after each of the adver@@ ts in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
businesses with high capital rac@@ ers as well as low vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity in their shares also sur@@ vey@@ ed their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will be most losing , said gold . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure share games , consumers are also benef@@ ited by the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; as@@ parag@@ us could see profits from higher y@@ iel@@ ds , even if experts are different opinions , how quickly it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the transmitter on its &quot; destruction &quot;

he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards and said that they just dis@@ counted The Br@@ its

&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; up to Classic FM , maint@@ ains a leading female board and increases new pressure on the radio , to prove that he does not do what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
the Conserv@@ ative de@@ pu@@ ties Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses to distinguish that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ant &quot; du@@ ck &quot; and increasingly do not differ from its commercial competitors .
&quot; Radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; s@@ illy &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn up to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted on BBC Music Awards in December last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only under one other name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate anything that is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General , the pre@@ cau@@ tions returns and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and education of the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn about Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ sur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music to find and put new works in order , I keep really important for important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of this year argu@@ ed BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that were harder to get involved to get the audience , when it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC @-@ production , that during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports for it under fire , to step the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot;

Internet re@@ vers@@ aries in August at slow and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
in the last month we have been the low@@ est result since the commen@@ cement of the year 2000
online sales rein@@ forced 3 years ago by using hand@@ ys to shop
experts believe that Black Friday has brak@@ ed on November Friday in November
&quot; for more than a decade the virtual shop has appeared , and many of the capit@@ als have turned into spir@@ its capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , experts say that there are indications that the online changes are stag@@ gering , after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expendi@@ tures for August presented the low@@ est increase in growth since the commen@@ cement of the year 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts tell that there are indications that online sales , after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go until 2000 , it has evol@@ ved in the course of time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G performance of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sellers were rein@@ forced from three years ago , as Bu@@ yers , with their glo@@ bes purch@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; it was important that more people could have online shopping and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home in the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , the one , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that has been import@@ ed from America is considered a reason for subsequent turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers have place their purch@@ ases from this event , which takes place on last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , fifty times the average number of buyers around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some tr@@ aders away . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer are fighting for bar@@ gain , buyers of it might be able to make purch@@ ases . &quot;
a study of British Retail Con@@ sor@@ tium found out that from 5 £ spending a bit more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and wash@@ es , more than one third of the purch@@ ases is now carried out via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time you buy more than one quarter of the people clothing and shoes online rather than in the mo@@ ons .

ten@@ ance from A@@ ich / Do@@ b due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday &apos;s Kl@@ agen@@ furt have to reply on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ ley@@ ball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ ei@@ sters A@@ ich / Do@@ b due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and descent .
the acc@@ used known not gu@@ il@@ ty .
one of them was also indi@@ cted for Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ing.html .
this pre@@ dec@@ ay he was un@@ spoken in May and spoken in May .
the current process has been trou@@ bled .
&quot; according to Ober@@ stat@@ san@@ walt Robert Ri@@ ffel had result@@ ed in the pre @-@ investigations that the acc@@ used in the years 2006 to 2011 money was disp@@ uted by the association regarding they used in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
the damage pre@@ c@@ ated with around 400@@ .000 Euro .
the ath@@ letes are also avoid@@ ed because of financial markets .
&quot; this fact was the president of the Sch@@ op@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Martin Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to the dis@@ appearance of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense is placed that the association had at no time an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports functional could have been ver@@ itable for elev@@ ations and sports club , for whom they have been active from 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the pas@@ va b@@ illing out in 2001 approximately 600@@ .000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : lead the club on or stop we ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the acc@@ used , in the bread@@ th of the financial back@@ panel of the financial am@@ ts . &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ cler@@ ks he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money prescribed by our way of life as security in the bank , &quot; he said in the recording . &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely and no deb@@ ts may be made .
furthermore - with appropriate financial success the payout of the allowance for compensation until 1991 have been decided .
&quot; for this reason , one part of the allowance cuts only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus has been paid in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the l@@ ump and non @-@ suff@@ iciency is possible to explain and explain the former ob@@ mann the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ no@@ books led the two acc@@ used together , the second sei@@ kl@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association was not dealt with in detail , asked the rich@@ est . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial security , just as much as the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one official inaugur@@ ation of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ner , an amount of 120.@@ 000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ soles had been , explained the acc@@ used . &quot;
this student account ran out on the name of the second attack and was according to his statement given to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; he wanted to know the sincer@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; after this , the asked for a long time was asked for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believ@@ ed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the pro@@ sec@@ utor presented in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ cler@@ k has been informed and justi@@ fy the function@@ alities .
this bank was form@@ ulated as a &quot; def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; why ind@@ em@@ nity ? , a@@ we wanted to know and pro@@ sec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion , the first attack , he did not agree with this phr@@ ase , because the association has never been damage to the association . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; with whom you are all from the ho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal ? &quot; , &quot; asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional , he never referred to a c@@ ents , he only beh@@ av@@ ed od@@ ometer and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; I asked the Club 1,000 Euro per month , the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documentation for the early years could not prove to be pre @-@ cl@@ oned .
&quot; these be judged after a supervision , in which everything was judged before , no longer has been kept , they declared . &quot;
od@@ ometer had also taken the second attacks .
&quot; all the resi@@ dences will be in cash , in addition , he must drive from his place of international markets to the bank after pen@@ alty , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for US not@@ hing@@ ness
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the U.S. not@@ are on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , together in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey under 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found out that a little more than half , the F@@ ed will do this , now that the F@@ ed will keep up a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been for seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a major central bank would probably leave the n@@ ash area and a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , Lei@@ een employees at the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , Bil@@ li@@ ons Dollar are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed may not ign@@ ore the less ro@@ vi@@ al outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets war@@ ned to raise an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced by 20.00 h ME@@ Z on Thursday

&quot; after the shooting and to@@ wing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he said Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s on the day his colleagues , I wrote sh@@ ann@@ on to say that to him &quot; &quot; p@@ ity &quot; &quot; with the first mur@@ der and wanted , &quot; he could make it in@@ happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;

I love Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after the writing of the Noti@@ z , 300 miles for the Delta State University , where he answered E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , k@@ ills before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening , as a polic@@ emen him embr@@ ac@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; Secretary @-@ President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he knows nothing of a conflict between eth@@ ical and Schmidt , but of course there was a little bit of Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the established believ@@ ed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there may be no evidence , no evidence &quot; for &quot; tri@@ angular relationships . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was named by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were about seven years of married , as a &quot; good person . &quot;

&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play monthly fr@@ ac@@ ture for dou@@ bling fr@@ act@@ ory
Luke Sha@@ w er@@ lit@@ t in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fr@@ act@@ ur of his right leg .
&quot; while this ex@@ termin@@ ate the left external def@@ ender to the W@@ einen , and join him for at least six months from the games , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can be playing back in this season . &quot;
the violation was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ct@@ or Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was covered nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fr@@ act@@ ory and is in hospital .
he will run tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy which comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very heavy and then takes place fantastic and then happens . &quot;
in the lo@@ cker he had a oxygen mas@@ ke .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fr@@ act@@ ory , then takes the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be escape to a red card and the suspension of a iv@@ ory .
&quot; Nicol@@ a Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ter was mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a iv@@ ory and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; an Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account , &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how cap@@ ut@@ t I am , my path to recovery goes now , I am getting stronger again . &quot;
here : Manchester United provides the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; the England &quot; &quot; England &quot; &quot; has an additional incen@@ tive to relax until the coming June . &quot;
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer I said : &quot; it is a very sh@@ iny injury .
&quot; when a player leaves this type of injury the place , all is very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hur@@ t a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg except Mexico against Van Ga@@ als Holland @-@ team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he does so hard because it was not his intention to hur@@ t the opponent , and if you hear , that it is a very worse injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in another direction , so it looked as if he had tou@@ ched him as if he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; tou@@ ched him , but I could not see the attack upon Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how heavy it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ game by Chris Sm@@ all@@ ing .
certainly David Cameron the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child does a book , it will not take long until you know it almost time to time . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked about a provider of child care systems , his favorite child rul@@ ed himself decided by the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 educ@@ ated environmental abel by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message it is a book that I like to give my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have now mis@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , descri@@ bing the action of the book , instead a content of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details are added to bro@@ aden their pretty original original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the surrounding city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone , and even the air is a com@@ modity named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see her desire to see a real tree , whose real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ uss ho@@ ver@@ ted and the 1991 died , but totally unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not sus@@ pic@@ ious enough : the text presents itself in part such as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a good , hopes a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he abo@@ de to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is the act of the book so little . here is an un@@ ben@@ ch@@ ant boy , like the local environment through the prot@@ est rap@@ e , a boot@@ ing , the cor@@ rug@@ ged character , &quot; which speaks to the name of the trees , &quot; wo@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which has read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in one child . &quot;
an Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ speaker said that the text probably come from Camer@@ ons elect@@ Office .
&quot; super@@ camps were confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons was supplied , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threat@@ ened from the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emir@@ ates , is a difficult task , but when one has selected the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , is a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test result@@ ing defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not close an up@@ ward eg .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ king page may possibly find less than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry away from 2012 , only a youth@@ ful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l sh@@ ave , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for attack . &quot;
here @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th squ@@ ates from the England test bre@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course for me as its chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ ust players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no frames at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I told this - players their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully see further gap for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss commen@@ ced his attitude , even if he did not brought so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test stroke receives to put his character is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got before him - ; during Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and up@@ wards .
&quot; the only pre@@ dec@@ ay that you can rise , was that England initially started Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the top - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a shock that I treasure high . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ Player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he was strug@@ gling against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which was very met us . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those in front of it , but this depends of course by the team members in the United Arab Emir@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would bring an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a stroke does not beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has not settled his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ers@@ hire , but it is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my early team@@ le Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined in 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and looked upon .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes in the ki@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my fin@@ ite dealing with him he has impressed me as young man very impressed .
&quot; people may possibly see its statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup times that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England a few kl@@ u@@ ge supplements made during trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ den@@ e , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test days could be a master@@ co@@ up . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since it has played amongst all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket Contest , as a player or Coach , and how Mah@@ ela has one insight , from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the lo@@ cker , even if the messages are in t@@ une with the before mess@@ ag@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team coll@@ ision with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some may not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ rider are not determine the timing . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that , as with players will depend on their jobs . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy heart .

&quot; David Camer@@ ons in@@ se@@ aled re @-@ negoti@@ ating strategy to hold Britain in the EU , it gets deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the gen@@ ius Jer@@ emy &quot; &quot; it is yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n on the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which are cru@@ ise for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; in Bright@@ on , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting , that it does not like it , if they ate the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister on summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of yourself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to look at the outside United Kingdom inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; L@@ ass we are not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us look out that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed Minister and officials were at that it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; in German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel argu@@ ed , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande pro@@ ud@@ ly looks forward to his re @-@ election or its realization in 2017 .

Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government to Spain .
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they become a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie bre@@ en to help whose energy should be better utili@@ zed , Scotland &apos;s dischar@@ ge out of the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies . &quot;

&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a pl@@ ei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ äu@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street at its cost , and what EU sc@@ ep@@ tic finds the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ idents in 1975 but not were , which made our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;

&quot; that was one of the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ efr@@ ont @-@ drag@@ ging , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers and pse@@ udo non @-@ countries that have most of our huge newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air is similar about it , but , however , that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ str@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ an as a Bl@@ air itself , when he has rej@@ ected the Camer@@ as refer@@ en@@ du@@ ck , for Bl@@ air had rej@@ ected the principle on the constitution by French and Dutch sub@@ du@@ es in 2005 that he opened with it a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never for@@ ged him .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me on Monday in Westminster , and I said to him that he no time needed for me to waste time - seems at risk , N@@ eil Kin@@ ner boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ t &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ he years to repeat , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I am very friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ent tendency and wild wick@@ ed of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say every one to that yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week said , as the bo@@ ys@@ cou@@ ts expressed in him , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of pro@@ vo@@ icing John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ id@@ ler was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ minded me of the 70 @-@ years , when his old father turned on TV to be willing to lay power@@ yal to its Labour Cab@@ inet without being too far and to lose its cab@@ in@@ et@@ y@@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s phr@@ ase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C said to all reports on their cl@@ ause during the evening . &quot;
whatever the sti@@ r @-@ up bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to give - think that he even has don@@ ated me - News and discipline remains in the Age of TV round the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no open @-@ card for Europe which allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ du@@ ce campaign for a self @-@ comp@@ re@@ hension , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks of sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities in the EU membership - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ar@@ isation economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ pres@@ idents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its maj@@ or@@ osis to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , J@@ C will not start any campaign for dischar@@ ge - will not be committed to foreign diplom@@ ats , to try to find a sense of their supervis@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin political capital get worse - they also have sus@@ pic@@ ious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all mean@@ ing@@ ful ?
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with an expense of the T@@ ory government at power , which I was re@@ minded about what was made by British influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was born from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to tobacco , said researchers . &quot;
experts which write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) Reg@@ ulated L@@ anc@@ et by being cri@@ tici@@ ze by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used post @-@ wise .
P@@ he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
yet some researchers have ques@@ tioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month attack the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on the p@@ he was bur@@ ied his most important conclusion .
&quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ I and have wonder@@ ed whether the claim &quot; &quot; to build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ew@@ ell , Professor of Clinical epi@@ demi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estim@@ ation is that &quot; &quot; the current best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed check of re@@ mod@@ elling and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to create a model for multiple lo@@ yalty criteria ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage caused by various nic@@ ot@@ in @-@ half products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ew@@ ell said that a sponsor for the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director has previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a Sustainability Report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting stated , funding of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes type , but not the funding they have to receive reports previously from the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Mor@@ ris International added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board will not be supplied , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also indicate a branch of industrial funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the sp@@ lash control .
at the session also the tobacco management of P@@ he participated .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; advoc@@ ates &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence for damages to most products with most criteria &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ew@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations in the P@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ew@@ ell said that the argument of P@@ he that there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking .
&quot; Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that has been previously respon@@ ded to the statement of BM@@ J already previously . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addi@@ ction .
&quot; all evidence places close that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long term effects . &quot;
P@@ he has the un@@ am@@ big@@ uous duty to the public information about what the proof of evidence is occupied and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking is the National Health system two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give East@@ ern@@ ders , says the former manager of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said , the BBC should stop making programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ alen &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows how the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should be used only to make the type of programs that cannot be sent through other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly noticed that they are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of sen@@ ders like B@@ BC@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General @-@ Board , Tony Hall , the company said to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried for six years at Channel 4 without success with the BBC in touch . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are placed in order or send , which is also clearly displayed by no sub@@ ven@@ tional ri@@ vals Committee in the context of his study on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I keep in Central or long term not for a good idea , one should not make its production at least on programs , which do not do or order . &quot;
you send The Voice in a top quality window because they want to achieve a wide support for their future as possible .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this , is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is natural sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed that could be financed without subsi@@ dies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
truly speaking other channels would give your right arm to it .
I willing to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would be the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a ent@@ repren@@ eur of series production , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC bl@@ ame for the hunt for reviews be &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC give us once again , what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ g@@ art Conference in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal entities &quot; to B@@ BC@@ 4 should not be measured , but they are ful@@ filling their tasks , and they can argu@@ ed if they appear on their apparent missions to justi@@ fication from 4 billion £ &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs , which no one has seen . &quot;
they put it into a contemporary window where nobody would ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the round @-@ fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I ur@@ ge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of terms , who can obtain the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if it is wrong , because they cons@@ ume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday to inform that the BBC their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission check out , to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classi@@ fied as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV @-@ production and 0.1 % in Radio and Canada to take an example in the public @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV will be shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ders will make alli@@ ances to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves

scientists have changed wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound @-@ waves .
the win@@ tern@@ al n@@ emat@@ o@@ des are changing the direction in the moment in which they have called sound imp@@ ul@@ ses to have heard of the human hearing at high frequencies in order to be cont@@ ested .
&quot; the imp@@ ul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , the gene@@ tically modified to wear the membran@@ e channels , who react on ultr@@ aso@@ und . &quot;
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain @-@ results with light
&quot; researchers said the researchers showed the power of a new proceedings , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ultr@@ aso@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ o and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the dep@@ ths of brain disease , the electric stim@@ uli in the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; declar@@ ations typically do not respond to ultr@@ aso@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they had done it when they were surrounded by an liquid with micros@@ copic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bl@@ ad@@ ors , he found out , rein@@ force the ul@@ tran@@ oise @-@ waves , which then enter into the saus@@ age . &quot;
the rein@@ forced ul@@ tran@@ oise @-@ pressure effect on structures that are called tr@@ p @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the saus@@ ages .
&quot; the sound @-@ waves work the opening of these id@@ ols and activate the cells that they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ o@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ oc@@ ons tr@@ act tr@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; when he applied ultr@@ aso@@ und to the changed cre@@ atures , the sound @-@ waves are rein@@ forced by the micro@@ ish and into the lit@@ ters where they swit@@ ched the changed mot@@ one@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a pione@@ ering tool , the scientists will allow , neur@@ ons with moment@@ ary of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to a op@@ tic fi@@ ber to the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ ths @-@ ultr@@ aso@@ und tis@@ sues can happen and can be sent in the brain from above on sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons over@@ due to the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and In@@ s@@ ulin @-@ produ@@ ci@@ ble cells , he added . &quot;

8 Golden rules for life in student Residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ m , but only in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smil@@ es that I den@@ ied it - and to the numerous , slow complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned , can be di@@ still@@ ed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the move in student Residen@@ ces ranges from slightly ner@@ ves to absolutely fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to un@@ wat@@ ts : people tell us , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you are truly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor h@@ ate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast Mar@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - do you have questions and do you think of interest .
&quot; it express@@ es the conversation and helps you to find out who you may not speak contrary to those , with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were in fire ated and this fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; the rooms of people turn to turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and commun@@ al number , but they are also the places where people are educ@@ ated and their under@@ gar@@ ments . &quot;
involved : do not think about the university with a relationship
introduction will be given a gro@@ om treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a re@@ fu@@ gi@@ um , yet many students form a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can lead friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be the hell for someone , who tries to relax . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will go that our friendship pass away , but you must take away the energy that I have consum@@ ed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ man@@ ly exhau@@ sted is exhau@@ sted and send it an SMS instead to kno@@ ck him .
speaking of pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student Residen@@ ces had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by back@@ en .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back Man@@ ie , is the r@@ amm@@ ing to the doors of people to imagine with a dish of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood . so , and now please smile , if I imagine you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade pasta cook@@ ers is a good way to connect friend@@ ships .
your fellow people feel oblig@@ ated to maintain themselves and will end your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a continuous bak@@ er . &quot;
&quot; bad mis@@ sed out of flour , sugar and b@@ gre@@ ase , that people will be sleeping when you ank@@ ed . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is a common crime in student Residen@@ ces .
of course the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop mil@@ k for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the opportunities are good , they say to even operate , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone trans@@ cri@@ ed your stuff is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that balanced as my room@@ mate , which add their milk a dishwasher , to be pun@@ ched . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise from sleep from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about to be a decent man , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ t to man who are in the glass @-@ house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neigh@@ b@@ ors if it makes them something out , Drum &amp; Bass has something silent , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ marked with even loud music .
&quot; when they finally arrived at 5 o &apos;clock , she turned her neigh@@ b@@ ors to sleep even two hours before they left their own music , her door shut down and walk to their thir@@ sty test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be rand@@ om@@ ed into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; vice versa , it would not be sec@@ lu@@ ous embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future married , to make themselves long and they will see every day and maybe experience how they all shared my common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future married , try at least , your under@@ taking a little reason . &quot;

the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds on the medium @-@ fr@@ än@@ k@@ ical ver@@ ental nu@@ ances for people who have not have a lot of money .
&quot; therefore , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need dw@@ elling , but also alone the mother and the sm@@ id@@ ur@@ ers alone . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to today still cheap and well build , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are pus@@ hing for the residence .
&quot; the ent@@ repren@@ eur Markus St@@ arling@@ er believes to know how quickly is affordable housing , it is installed in a project f@@ enhäuser for refugees . &quot;
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pus@@ hing for the resi@@ dual market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refuge@@ e stro@@ kes , we also require enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a whole , three @-@ story @-@ line @-@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration .
that is different when people s@@ wal@@ low in d@@ well@@ ings .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three resi@@ dences for each four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is back peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; gen@@ res : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house exp@@ ires on 184 000 Euro , without property . &quot;
this is over@@ looked .
six months the construction has lasted .
this is reasonable .
do the implementation of these plans have respon@@ ded to their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : buil@@ ders have passed my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ing value and the actu@@ ation order .
Lon@@ ecl@@ one .
&quot; it will still be signed , who creates in a town@@ house three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the owners react to their town@@ house @-@ project ?
&quot; gen@@ res : there were , which have thro@@ wn me first , luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what definitely is not right ?
but do not waste your competit@@ or fight for affordable housing ?
&quot; gen@@ res : true is : we had a construction boom in Germany , but were built in the last five years , but a luxury apartments that can hardly afford to spend more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also alone as well as the mother or the sm@@ all@@ ur@@ ers alone . &quot;
I show how one can also buy a low pri@@ ced and good today .
therefore it is about .

it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located close to a charge . so the battery is loaded .

&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen goes to retirement , her husband left Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor to the next months to the page . &quot;
&quot; after a remo@@ ving phase Müller the practice opened on October 12 , until then he invested some 310@@ 000 Euro into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight than the field of rock stories before Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who has at present their speci@@ alis@@ ing activities in the per@@ former hospital and want to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in the rear @-@ head that the gar@@ b@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen and lau@@ gh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I was easy to inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; married Müller , the idea fell to operate our own practice in future in As@@ endorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet the families over the years and accompany them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after remo@@ del@@ ing the rooms of modern look .
we will offer more ultr@@ aso@@ und studies as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load @-@ EK@@ GS and need a donation @-@ room anymore .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V will completely renewed . &quot;

&quot; this shows how proud and we are glad , that the practice is continued to practice , &quot; st@@ ressed with Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients arrive according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter in the practice Fel@@ isti@@ ausen , in the north @-@ German break@@ through practice are about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another home office .
a positive @-@ effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , they would also have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits , who , by the way , the way continues to look above all in familiar faces : ass@@ umes the seven medical specialist and the cleaning force of the fields of rock . &quot;
&quot; with their far@@ ew@@ ell in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medical medicine have been practic@@ ed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ble sh@@ allow . &quot;
a little w@@ eh@@ ye worship them after the long time already .
&quot; but we live on in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , and many patients are sure to see too often , &quot; says the dormit@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; your man is sup@@ plem@@ ented : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ meter @-@ plot . &quot;

&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we let the refugees &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls also works on our South border , &quot; said inner Prime Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain er@@ u@@ pright .
&quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to place an asylum application , this is also &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
the power supply and safety of man stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; but clear , but also , &quot; that there are distinct signals &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows but not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia are considering &quot; Cor@@ rid@@ or &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously shared with Slovenia , also to ex@@ emp@@ t Slovenia in the coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and can also educ@@ ate corrid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
quite so saw this inter@@ minist@@ ering Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
&quot; the idea of corrid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia , rather the monitoring of the border - especially for Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
the border with Croatia is as an outer border of the Sch@@ engen area already is strongly controlled .
&quot; as the mini@@ stri@@ es emphas@@ ized , Slovenia leads to its borders for refugees but not ab@@ ri@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; st@@ ressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government promised , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday , in the border of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d past to change the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could gra@@ b them in the near cor@@ k fields .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meet police vehicles with a new refugees .
&quot; it is pre@@ domin@@ antly about Sy@@ rian and Af@@ gh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
&quot; also , rescue services and the R@@ ote Cross were already in use . &quot;
&quot; in the coming days of calcul@@ ating his country with around 4000 refugees , the Minister of R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses deri@@ ves from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian bound@@ ary who had previously introduced to immig@@ rants in the Hungarian border , the Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday did not match . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Bel@@ grade are cancelled , however , that they would like to hit certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we do so , nor do we want to do this . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reporting , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border of Si@@ d arrived , during the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the shopp@@ ers were the whole night from around 500 kilometers distant the Maced@@ onian bound@@ ary through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it now could actually be preced@@ ed by ob@@ servers , prior to the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west distance . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive choices for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ iz@@ es that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong est@@ rogen of refugees , according to the corresponding plans for possible fail@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; details did not , he proved that Croatia proved to be a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive range of possibilities to the border control . &quot;
you lead strict controls to quali@@ fy for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU @-@ partner place the country since then by no means a good testim@@ ony that concerns the standard of border control . &quot;
&quot; on Ser@@ bian side , the border of the Hungarian border continues to be approximately 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ grade , they had seen the past night at the bor@@ der@@ line of H@@ org@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the information of the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ es H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continues to be completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Ser@@ bian interior of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ othing un@@ preced@@ ented in H@@ org@@ os , once again the debates on Altern@@ ate refugees in H@@ org@@ os , after the Hungarian border is closed , for early . &quot;
it would not take to pay very high refuge@@ e refugees .
&quot; you could not say , whether they would like their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
Assistant of migrants to - dangerous - Altern@@ ate ro@@ ds
&quot; however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border over@@ comes between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian path still not cli@@ cked min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police have been known that a team of min@@ ig@@ s was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; again , on the edge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with the dy@@ ing . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make sure the end of this world at some time , I can live responsible for me , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onian work of Mannheim , which is working together with Car@@ ites Association for the ecum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ am . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this princip@@ ality is effective for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however that not everyone comes to the tables publicly , however , be understand@@ able , eventually it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and ster@@ ity is gradually changing with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , who have just begun the Hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have helped to open their people . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , final prospects for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ efer Gig@@ ant rein@@ forced its pay@@ outs throughout the year because of the weak@@ ness demand for frei@@ ght services and higher costs in its bottom transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to emplo@@ y approximately 5@@ 5,000 workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex on that the company wants to emplo@@ y 5@@ 0.000 seasons for the holiday time . &quot;
the share fell 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market Trade in 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said , a profit between 10@@ ,40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year earn , 20 cent less than in former pre@@ di@@ ctions . &quot;
analy@@ sts expected according to a survey of Fact@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes in spite of the sale of payments , which will be effective as an average of 4,@@ 9 per cent and despite higher refu@@ ges for floors of heavy and large pack@@ ets , which will be collected since November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it nevertheless expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost , higher income and because of growth in the online trade . &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings solid income when you consider the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Riv@@ alen U@@ PS , who is planning , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional work@@ force , including the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 692 million $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the result per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of z@@ acks Investment Research asked analy@@ sts analy@@ sts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of z@@ acks asked analy@@ sts to $ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has made a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ing shipping that brought the turnover in its unit express shipping costs . &quot;
but the B@@ oom in the Online @-@ Shopping has raised the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically sh@@ allow due to higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express @-@ unit refers to higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result due to higher employment costs in the frei@@ ght market . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , approximately an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they locked up with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; at their most anticip@@ ated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since nearly a decade the body . &quot;
&quot; threats to them at one end of the fixed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting area is the picture of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ sh@@ afts , and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation to all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a two order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed guide have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mandate gives financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision , which is too tight for them . it will be released on Thursday from the un@@ preced@@ ented incen@@ tive by the un@@ preced@@ ented incen@@ tive since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are solid growing , the recent tur@@ bul@@ ence at the global financial markets make the already pre @-@ sight@@ ed F@@ ed Represent@@ atives to strengthen these vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity due to the lifting of the interest rate for federal law - and it is only one quarter of the percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economy at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate did not increase , the increased un@@ certainty around the global market enough justi@@ fication , still waiting to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus that what the F@@ ed shall do what is in@@ sured by itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently asked before Bloom@@ berg have been predict@@ ed this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indic@@ ator that shows only a 30 % chance to raise an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in stock market , if the F@@ ed he@@ ed the sentence , unless the str@@ ate@@ es elev@@ ated the blow by filling them that a further increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday sp@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score for 228@@ 95 points or about 1,@@ 4 % at 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action has been trig@@ ger@@ ed by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , you have to take a far away in their explanation to so@@ othing the financial markets so that they are not in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a tongue would so@@ othing the financial markets , because they would act un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act , eliminate . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed on track to increase the set by 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow @-@ slow@@ ing of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in spring and in early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in pro@@ position . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , was the improvement in the labour market this year . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate at 5.5 % last month , the low@@ est for more than seven years and near the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as a full employment . &quot;
sub@@ missions have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly hidden under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , said the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , that the main reason the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it due to the cl@@ amping in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world reached the end of last month after China had pic@@ ked its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ se fell by more than 16 % under its peak , as investors advoc@@ ates that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would be a global growth drug . &quot;
&quot; the market has a little relaxing in this month , with the D@@ ow now around 10 % under the Ho@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives affect the market tur@@ bul@@ ence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weak@@ ness of the Chinese economy has not occurred in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employees of the U.S. not@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; now , he ahead that she will wait for at least one month to get the impact better on the handle . &quot;
&quot; there are a lot of ins@@ ec@@ urity about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable information that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the economy of the world economy is none of the main objective of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end@@ ure the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world .
the impact of the central bank was huge in recent years .
&quot; the mere reference of that time , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; was sp@@ elled , cr@@ ashes around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world , markets and economies are increasingly connected by the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , they can not only monitor the developments at other place , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ abell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transi@@ tions to financial market movements , which are linked to economic Fund@@ ament@@ ary data . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , un@@ anim@@ ated member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a period of interest , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its cor@@ n@@ ins to 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives made these cuts of cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the quar@@ terly , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ bul@@ ences are not close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she will certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of an adver@@ tise , because the markets were over@@ shad@@ owed , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should th@@ res@@ ume the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more refugees arrive to this day in Germany .
welcome to prepare a warm welcome - does not go without the commitment of countless more volunte@@ er help@@ ers .
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ pec@@ uli@@ ar asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
to them belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with her 74 L@@ ences are taught them still .
every Thursday they are doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan , who learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is completely different lessons than at a real school . &quot;
Bras@@ ilian Pu@@ ä@@ di@@ atr@@ ische Gesellschaft Rio Grande promotes food for health@@ ier breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women about how important good diet during the breast@@ feeding time . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are interested in bre@@ asts that are painted with int@@ ments of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , f@@ ats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregn@@ ant and young mot@@ hers , their daily cal@@ ories came to increase by approximately 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only edi@@ t@@ onic adaptation to the mot@@ hers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Main Local College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregn@@ ant women actually affects the gen@@ es of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ard@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the Mun@@ icip@@ al Bern@@ ried approved the completion for the 2,@@ 3 million euros co@@ orth@@ alle .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ rej@@ ected turn@@ tables at the Bern@@ wars of the sport management are moving step by step : in the yo@@ un@@ gest par@@ ak@@ al meeting , the out@@ ed construction has been matched to a great discussions without any major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the committee was agreed among other things nor an application for the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; ex@@ emption &quot; &quot; of valid reform plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof design . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof is supposed to be er@@ ected with non @-@ with@@ standing first and roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; through this , we get a wonderful big South @-@ roof together , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in session . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; liberation , it was in turn around the at@@ ine , which is intended for energe@@ tic reasons - unlike in the building plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary , because the draft plan regarding the roof pitch is not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the amber of the community generally rever@@ sible to liber@@ ated contracts rather restri@@ c@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; in case of turn@@ out , however , this is not a re@@ curr@@ ing project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ence , so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ out construction at the Sport@@ zentrum is a community project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
the costs are reduced about 2,@@ 3 million euros .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport .
&quot; in the next process , the construction programme will now be submitted for the 18 x 36 meters high hall now to the trial . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed before as planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) appointed new medical director at the Hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg by to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of hospital GmbH in the county , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiss confirmed . &quot;
&quot; a decision on the re@@ acts of the Supervisory Board , and the figures on the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are put into practice , then all of the 50 employees would be continued at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhel@@ ming majority gu@@ ise with fisher@@ men and the further inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are present .
&quot; the staff , which cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about plans .
&quot; trig@@ ger@@ ed , the change has changed the dism@@ is@@ sal of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , which is only one of the beginning of the commen@@ cement of the Har@@ vest@@ y Clinic and now changes to a private surgery in the near of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in question who shall pass the succ@@ ession came , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; was prepared to take over from October 1st and to exchange with his team according to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this can indicate this in any case a &quot; validation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardi@@ pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Ch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological conditions .
&quot; in part for the next two years fisher@@ men will be with his team , when the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree with both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ort , which is still concluded about 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the farmers had been planned for 2018 if the current restructuring at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim has been completed . &quot;
&quot; land@@ lady Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the supervis@@ ory board , entered the sm@@ ells , which is in the possession of the Federal Government , will be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I close I . as it goes on . as it goes with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say it may give several consider@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ al Psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what circum@@ cis@@ ed us could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , so fisher@@ men over the tor@@ asi move to the le@@ ch , who has been fully welcomed by the staff &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , has been working in fisher@@ men for more than 30 years , have not been given . &quot;
he was asked by sch@@ ong@@ ated colleagues to take care of the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threat@@ ened off closure , departments during the past decades was closed , for example the surgery and the birthday . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar li@@ ons are called an evening ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the tab@@ ular leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear Favor@@ it , occasion to over@@ load there is none . &quot;

&quot; the suffering of the young woman was found at the Tu@@ es@@ days in Rock@@ en@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s and police on Wednesday morning . &quot;

the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing in Sonn@@ day morning after they arrived at the eve for a visit to a Herbst@@ po@@ et in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns on housing
the situation on the German living area is stra@@ ined .
&quot; also , more refugees are seeking a pay@@ able lead . &quot;
the pressure on the market @-@ market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the di@@ gest fig@@ hts on the German residence market have started off .
&quot; with the coming refugees and labour @-@ seek@@ ers from the EU pus@@ hing more people on a market , which is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
it compete with income weak citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built up to 2020 every year 400@@ .000 new units . &quot;
this result comes a study on behalf of the deb@@ ug@@ ging of &quot; social housing . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are ready . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 14@@ 0,000 apartments . &quot;
refugees are no longer comm@@ ited after the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial investment accommodation .
&quot; many encounter then on the market @-@ market , and sets up into the long sn@@ akes in front of the hir@@ ing apartments . &quot;
&quot; according to the statistics of the Federal Office , the last year is less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the living room is not only at the rising refuge@@ e currency . &quot;
the study also makes considerable experience in the construction policy of the past few years .
Germany Shi@@ eves a housing defic@@ it that becomes bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently missing in the ball@@ rooms already around 77@@ 0,000 resi@@ dences , be@@ k Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many Profession@@ als therefore live in large capit@@ als in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed because of the built on the residence permit no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per cap@@ ita over the past years was dr@@ unk .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance called &quot; social housing &quot; to start a rest@@ art . &quot;
the new incen@@ tives should boost the social housing construction again .
&quot; thus , the basic tax could be avoid@@ ed and the basic tax should be exposed to sponsor@@ ed apartments . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the alliance is necessary attractive tax @-@ prescri@@ ptions . &quot;
the promot@@ er programme for refuge@@ e world is coming well in towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start was reached by 184 million euros , already more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been launched . &quot;
now the project could even be stock@@ ed .
refugees have free movement : Croatia and Slovenia must set up corrid@@ or .
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no more and more refugees choose the way of Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; dangerous is the route , yet . &quot;
Croatia wants to uph@@ old the neighbouring village of Slovenia over the establishment of a corrid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian inner Prime Minister and when it is necessary , we will organize a corrid@@ or , &quot; said the Croatian Minister R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is not yet a Sch@@ engen country .
&quot; after the deport@@ ation of the Ser@@ bian border , hundreds of refugees arrive after Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
500 people came about the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik to report the Croatian TV sender .
Hungary had se@@ aled its border to refugees during the day before .
&quot; new laws created on the same day into force , make this ordinary asylum seek@@ ers in Hungary virtually over@@ liquid . &quot;
Croatia wants to happen refugees .
&quot; Croatian Minister of Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , women , children and men who live and want to achieve something . &quot;
however there were people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the neighbouring neighbor@@ ing Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most import@@ antly media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and taxi services to the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border the refugees come not to the land@@ f@@ ence .
&quot; for this , the bor@@ der@@ line of other haz@@ ards : there are still shar@@ p min@@ es from the jug@@ ation of civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ sp@@ atial should now create a secure password .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border there is no more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police of 366 believ@@ ed people .
&quot; shortly before the gate on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border count as off@@ ence .
&quot; therefore , in the south@@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , that is why 35 criminal proceedings were initi@@ ated . &quot;
the condem@@ ned cont@@ ests will take up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the registration office , we took on Tuesday to the newly at the border of the &quot; transit of 94 asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; in total 94 asylum seek@@ ers , almost all - 93 - the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applic@@ ant , 13 families with small children , as well as two older people . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the morning , there were still 40 refugees there . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has no longer a view in Hungary A@@ sy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after an un@@ anim@@ ous view Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rej@@ ected asylum seek@@ er should be taken up there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit &quot; &quot; to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , they gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to come up with it .
they gathered together the tr@@ ash that had left the tens of thousands of people in the last weeks .
&quot; blo@@ bs were dism@@ ant@@ led , and one of the tr@@ actor in the Grenz@@ ort was converted . &quot;
&quot; to the aim of this transformation , nobody wanted to express . &quot;
Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary are only a few refugees away .
the country has also rein@@ forced its border control .
&quot; for the 20,000 immig@@ rants arrive after reg@@ imes , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people waiting for driving trip to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning to the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing rose regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; on the border
&quot; we were after the bridge on Sunday with the freedom , as suddenly ten people with tour caff@@ eine stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so Wern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted by train to Passau . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had un@@ expected on Sunday but because of the refuge@@ e stro@@ ms to the railway transport with Austria , he was in Wern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , so Stad@@ ler , who immediately provided his help and the fram@@ ed@@ ed together with two further Hel@@ ben and their cars on the border into the Ne@@ ar D@@ us@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; before we have the un@@ hoff@@ ed guests only once again , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we will bring them by car to Passau . &quot;
&quot; it was of course for us , &quot; as a Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it pass away to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire .
&quot; this has been very happy , so the city . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ ile tr@@ actor @-@ pass@@ ages have ris@@ en on the Sunday evening in Wels of a ICE in a regional direction to Passau , to dis@@ continued it after the short notice that the railway transport to Germany was set to try but still over the border to try . &quot;
but the regional train has been completed before the border of Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high on the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the bay@@ er@@ ische neighbours am Sunday soci@@ able , tags previously a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ able sport@@ y - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sent further ton@@ ight to us is a logical result of a national policy :
&quot; instead of the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right away in the establishment of structures to help humanity , our German Chanc@@ ell@@ or has officially established the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dark Soci@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; suffering of this policy are not only those Austrian , which are now facing the border areas with cha@@ otic states . &quot;
&quot; also , the p@@ oul@@ try will determine that the &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcome , nothing but another refuge@@ e camps is . &quot;
&quot; it will become a big challenge , given the ongoing refuge@@ e curr@@ ents and of the nearby winter , among us human beings @-@ worthy conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad looking for 35.@@ 000 winter@@ ing lod@@ g@@ ings
Konrad has fully to do with the refuge@@ e isol@@ ation all the hands .
Christian Konrad is it known that his word has weight .
the government has used the previous powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker in order to provide lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the initial trial Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on a grip .
&quot; we have no shel@@ ter more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told by his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday to Austria without great vor@@ tex , Konrad and lob@@ by@@ ing the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ ing power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; kr@@ is@@ enh@@ af@@ ting situation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , with a need of 8@@ 5,000 Lod@@ g@@ ings in the he@@ uris@@ tic year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , we have to be found to 35.@@ 000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 to provide the countries , 15.@@ 000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a f@@ ass without ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the state of state he already has talks .
these would have helped him to make lod@@ g@@ ings even for the upcoming refugees lod@@ g@@ ings .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said F@@ erry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supported Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations requires the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ator in the OR@@ F promotion &quot; , &quot; as we . &quot;
on the platform we can offer individuals un@@ complex accommodations .
&quot; in addition , you are hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier kri@@ ti@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation than &apos; very high .
in not@@ ion it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ors must have a certain height of the tow@@ el holder or size of the tor@@ ment .
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; not@@ ices would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; that he is successful in contrast to the internal state of the accommodation , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a f@@ ake Lord , whom not without further into the face the in@@ tru@@ der . &quot;
pers@@ u@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier does the Republic do not cause any cost , as they themselves declared . &quot;
their employees want to increase her on three to four years .
our own accom@@ od@@ ations has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the square Stephan@@ splatz in the office .
&quot; however , there is no problems with the permit . &quot;
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; first , not opening uph@@ e@@ av@@ als and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees , the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this is not necessary , since one can currently under@@ take this action without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , however , further locations will be tested on their exchange . &quot;
criticism of the manager at the division of refugees inside the federal land .
other districts must contribute to their contributions here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not se@@ aled &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( C@@ SU ) has entr@@ u@@ ded the govern@@ or Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further action in the refuge@@ e question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has in@@ sured that the German borders will not be se@@ aled .
the advanc@@ ement of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there will now be the corresponding border control . &quot;
there will be no more special interest in Germany with refugees in Germany .
the protective su@@ ffer@@ ers would however brought to Germany with regular jour@@ neys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states called P@@ ühr@@ inger once more rein@@ forced solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria has entered into its borders again , is a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the General Assembly of the &quot; Die Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer head@@ line is officially finished .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building is the b@@ ör@@ sen@@ ot@@ ted IT @-@ corporation S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative enterprises from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in the IT , the clever heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine to invest in Start@@ up companies of the New World , and later also which too ac@@ qui@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; already from the beginning on the start S &amp; T he wants to co @-@ operate with the new neigh@@ b@@ ors - who speaks of Nieder@@ haus@@ er , &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T to the site 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country Ober@@ österreich and the covenant ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is widely respected by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter resi@@ des in the building are rented for another 40 per cent .

&quot; this project had to get the 49 @-@ year of the lif@@ ter of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in curve bow : finally , they now have access in the form of another business . &quot;
&quot; in the fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite of the business , in which they s@@ ells among other bags , cases , shoes and robe of different manufacturers , now all around the sho@@ cks of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
large po@@ ckets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously it has been re@@ built several weeks .
&quot; but I have super@@ vised a long time , whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says Bri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location , where only their towels were sold , which were only done . &quot;
&quot; we are the one @-@ in @-@ room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
your mode @-@ interest has set broad range of her mother into the cr@@ ad@@ le .
&quot; to me , most , when something developed and I can show new trends and show prices . &quot;
&quot; why some woman with sight on a beautiful Hand@@ bag in dist@@ or@@ tion , can also be answered in the professional wife with the last security . &quot;

the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants offerings .
&quot; this property connects man@@ holes also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants US @-@ president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for excitement good .
whether it does alien@@ ated foreign journalists or science at the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the U.S. pres@@ idential and the elect@@ or@@ ate campaign too power@@ fully .
and cuts good here .
&quot; this is also registered in the P@@ us@@ sian K@@ all@@ town , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ milli@@ ard come . &quot;
the New Yor@@ ker with its gr@@ ac@@ ing spa is many in the win@@ zer@@ dorf by the win@@ egro@@ wn on the wine road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is above -@@ zig cor@@ ners with it related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in voting mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del dre@@ w a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ ag@@ ers think about his goal of being the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think you will find the somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native fight@@ ers has a am@@ using documentary movie about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ ings with which beside Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for compl@@ aint , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) as well as word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful when he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the heart , he has not put it there . &quot;
&quot; although there may be respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ant the mind that Tru@@ mp &quot; already be a little mouth . &quot; be , says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; random of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ town in the Cir@@ cular , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ english : the offer , says them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the offering .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather had been emig@@ rated and opened a local for gold@@ bers . &quot;
Flo@@ or@@ stone of the real estate company were first major race sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ ic : your desire to return to the home to the homeland , to whom the Palatinate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not received Tru@@ mp because it was once without permission to be h@@ ew@@ ing , the director of the Institute for P@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Eth@@ ology , Roland Paul , for film started . &quot;
Tru@@ mp be the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;
this is in contrast to the member of the statements of the desc@@ endants .
he had repeat@@ edly called sus@@ cep@@ tible across Mexican immig@@ rants in the USA and called construction of a border wall to prevent illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; so as the pol@@ ises , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote ri@@ mp of Tru@@ m@@ ps ( &quot; Die O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was bak@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the wind in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ off@@ ish , &quot; he is always so lav@@ ish . &quot;
believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; this can I not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care about K@@ all@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ ensi@@ ons@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz during visiting something for the church org@@ el sp@@ ended , which was generally well ank@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; this can I imagine myself from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; you put it better if he did not win the choice because , &quot; who has such radi@@ cal views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been at the time of his grandfather in the United States , they would have been like him , &quot; he would never have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B@@ üh@@ ler . &quot;
and as a president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;

the great cur@@ ity for Seven was the impressive deb@@ ut of 800 words with the former ser@@ ial of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently re@@ wit@@ ched father , which clos@@ es himself with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reaching a very impressive number of 1.@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
cri@@ tics had wonder@@ ed whether she was able to wear a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes &apos; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit the Block ( 83@@ 8.@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 hrs ) the new Quiz Show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ eps in average 44@@ 6.@@ 000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang out to 6@@ 23.@@ 000 vie@@ wers - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .

hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening from The Ch@@ ase Australia will clearly agree that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately prev@@ ail at 5 : 30@@ pm .

the last three votes takes over : Bachelor &apos;s Wood Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
reve@@ aling ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably did not kno@@ w@@ ingly , who is the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s finally was lan@@ ed , was wr@@ apped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining back@@ ed girls will certainly not be in@@ expensive whether she is the one that has received the last Rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two are registered , you may possibly have a reference to that who will be vict@@ ori@@ ous . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps its lips up to the finale at Thursday fixed at se@@ aled
&quot; all three women dropped out in ly@@ rical way , why Wood the perfect man is and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude than reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is ques@@ tioned &quot; If not you , who should get Woo@@ ds last Rose ? &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game that he won the heart of the author . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and s@@ ams energies notic@@ eable that they were pretty compatible and I &apos;ve imag@@ ined this throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons &apos; Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it makes as much fun to be with her together , , added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood can be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the first visit last week its clearly made that Wood &quot; &quot; One may be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this obviously not only a game - I &apos;m now ready to fix it on him . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose a Wood , if not she , because she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left un@@ even girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his n@@ fl career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his moving to the USA - and there were many other teams working with his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some trainers would have Hay@@ ward for the rema@@ inder of the game on the bank , when he lost an od@@ angle so lost , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby @-@ League with his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a p@@ unt return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to be as true face in the lo@@ cker from the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encour@@ aged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ thes@@ ter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was encour@@ aged by Special @-@ teams Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who supplies to forget his ver@@ esses , and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a P@@ unt which was restored in the first playing district of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian tr@@ ace@@ ability to be hop@@ ed for his n@@ fl deb@@ ut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne led the playing field and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine anymore into his n@@ fl career .
&quot; that was a thing that is happening now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ dn diver@@ t the cuts with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ate at that time in 2007 as a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a Tr@@ y for Queens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

Google will start dou@@ bling donation campaign to earn 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help the thousands of refugees who have passed by the European nations , since they fle@@ e out from the war of err@@ ent and ver@@ eign countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach to the disclosure of donations to his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , who has been flown out with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; on our journey there were many dark and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refuge@@ e crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family des@@ per@@ ately desp@@ ised for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organizations which provide help for refugees and migrants are doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5,@@ 5 million on google.com / to@@ c@@ ant to be doubl@@ ed to 11 million $ . &quot;
&quot; Europe has been confront@@ ed with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

for easy overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be helpful health care .
the benefits of weight losses for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last after a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still early to say , whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight exp@@ anders longer live as those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss Sur@@ gery , which wrote an editorial regarding the new study in j@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight @-@ loss operations or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to simpli@@ fy the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to ab@@ sorb food .
&quot; over the years , the obes@@ ity surg@@ eries to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes is proven effective , but most studies were conducted at people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight regarding size , is regarded as normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can compu@@ te your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers used from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which since 2007 have collected in a study and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery and stomach @-@ tube - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes among people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ taken this operation , san@@ k from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with those who do not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subj@@ ected to a surgical procedure , the holes of 36 % of the diabetes is totally accepted and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes is completely only in one percent and partly with only two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and of the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also wo@@ ven the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c levels of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
but in the medical therapy there remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflects in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - has not been the mort@@ ality of five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team is also present average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 v@@ s. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater stat@@ utes in the BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % v@@ s. 2,@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % v@@ s. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival rates of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery takes to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subj@@ ected to ob@@ ese surgery , who studied in obes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study does not show advantage for survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone , it would be so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I Group is lower , without raised risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , once the patient with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 lies . &quot;
&quot; I think that we wait for long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have collected this gene@@ tic changes that have firmly root@@ ed their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a rever@@ sibility is really hard . &quot;
Lov@@ age plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently available in Bell@@ etr@@ istik . a young woman , to school hours un@@ popular and un@@ sight@@ ly , hits after years the s@@ warm of her youth again , and this promise them in them . &quot;
&quot; so also in recent novel , we are not so &quot; &quot; Luisa B@@ inder &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; beyond the love history , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and surrounding villages . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everybody to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leader is requested to end the violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the growing refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten days during the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford in which he dedicated himself to Eth@@ ic studies .
he demand@@ ed that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of each individual nations or even contin@@ ents .
he st@@ ressed that the reaction of the western European countries to the refuge@@ e crisis may be admir@@ able but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to get lob@@ by@@ ing the crisis , he st@@ ressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think long term solutions just like a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; st@@ ressed . &quot;
finally we have to think about how the k@@ illing in their countries is reduced .
we have to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented upon George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror@@ ist attack of 11 September and introduced out that the viol@@ ent reaction of the USA had a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 I expressed my conf@@ ession in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he sat down , and this has had un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of incl@@ ine dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; control centers in the United States report about a nearly 400 @-@ owned increase in the number of children under twelve years , the strongly non @-@ alco@@ holi@@ c handles , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years , the po@@ ison centers are reporting , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are inten@@ tionally drinking , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ually re@@ hear@@ sal for social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are only used because of a cheap experience .
young people have suppos@@ edly dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alco@@ holi@@ c sau@@ ces mixed to be a t@@ ough@@ er bever@@ age .
younger children can be cli@@ cked by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attr@@ activ@@ e@@ ers ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ fü@@ m@@ ated .
&quot; there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grap@@ e and orange pe@@ aks that are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially in small kin@@ ks can already run a few spra@@ yer to alcohol det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication .
&quot; it is highly focused alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ebooks at the Hospital of the University of Kan@@ sas , the Sender Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would have no conclusion whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come from it , then it is a quick way to cons@@ ume much alcohol . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yer of after strawberry frag@@ rant inf@@ ect@@ ants in school was taken into an emergency . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ con@@ centr@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the th@@ res@@ hold , which is considered by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician , who treated them in G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of At@@ lanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was unable to go when they arrived in the emergency .
physi@@ cians survi@@ ved they over night in a separate child hospital house on signs of shepherd trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and felt thanks to the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ght@@ ening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been more de@@ adly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teaching books to use non @-@ alco@@ holi@@ c products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant for use and inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with deaths .

&quot; Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland you do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the rank is not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the rank .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the old @-@ packaging games and they are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

&quot; I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very an@@ gry or s@@ adly about what happens . &quot;

&quot; despite his comments only a few weeks ago , that he considers some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Bos@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful about the signing of neutr@@ ality and persi@@ sts that he will not disturb@@ s the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad . &quot;
the ex @-@ Chief of Brent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window .
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate yourself what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding un@@ necessary players to add what you really need .
Cel@@ tic @-@ Ziel@@ ona Mich@@ u with Re@@ duc@@ tive notice
&quot; Sw@@ an@@ sea @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , has revealed that he could withdraw from the contract at the Sw@@ ans . &quot;
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has failed for two years with an anno@@ ying boy and did not make the passage from Wales in this summer .
H@@ ear@@ ts adjusted to SF@@ A @-@ Battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; the H@@ ear@@ ts have been sent 2 : 1 , as a Pat@@ erson of the field was sent and lost 3 : 2 , but the R@@ ote card of the Def@@ ence was lift@@ ed later - the third R@@ ote card of Coll@@ um that was re@@ vo@@ ke in eight months . &quot;
&quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and persi@@ stent : &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot;

the inci@@ dent took place in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was an Derby , and it was the heat of attention , &quot; said the stor@@ ms and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ le , if it doesn &apos;t matter for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;
tan@@ na@@ di@@ ce Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ elly j@@ elly that the board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - gest@@ ures that the decline has to end on the pitch .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; we will bring the guys back to tr@@ b , &quot; said Donn@@ elly . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad , against Hamilton &quot; un@@ nice to win . &quot;
&quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es , that his crew had to fight from Aber@@ deen bran@@ t against Hamilton , to put them a scre@@ ening of five points before Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ eys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half of the first half . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won all , in poker , or l@@ ame , the games of this kind also won &apos;t have won . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged since it rises in the United Kingdom altogether .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period around 10,000 at 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s employment rate of 5,@@ 9 percent was about the U@@ K@@ s of 5,@@ 5 percent , as shown the numbers of the office for Nation@@ ale statistics ( ons ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the employment in Scotland fell to 12 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell on 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number over the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the State secret@@ ary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long term plan of the government has laid the corner@@ stone for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scot@@ tish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witness of an Ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ahoma
&quot; somewhat later today , except with a late law intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience &apos;s gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is ex@@ clu@@ stered through the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he pra@@ yed me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation was first presented at the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed to . &quot;
&quot; as the day closer , I began to fear me . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story of the death pen@@ alty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists will be able to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applic@@ ants are available as places available , there is a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery instead to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ahoma has reduced the number of medi@@ ums from 12 to five .
who is selected ; it will observe it emoti@@ on@@ ally .
I cannot do this .
&quot; I will sit alongside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps of the first friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone and a two @-@ half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh lots of times when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journ@@ alist , so it will not allow me to record a not@@ ebook and a pin , to record what I see . &quot;
I have to simply try to remember all the details .
a journ@@ alist from O@@ kl@@ ahoma took me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the favorite , as he wants it , and you will get access . &quot;
I describe myself with her .
&quot; they sp@@ ilt that they could have had &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he does not say what I have to write , and I would do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I said to him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants to be present an international repor@@ ter , to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he die , he thinks that the public relations work to help the movement against death pen@@ alty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go down here again to all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him gu@@ il@@ ty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong prob@@ ability is that he is not gu@@ il@@ ty of the Mor@@ der .
I believe that there is no enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ter that you may contact for this .
&quot; what you get from me , is what it is said to see a man a un@@ necessary death . &quot;
man after feu@@ dal police @-@ jag@@ d jag@@ d over@@ comes from the C@@ anning River to come
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he passed the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man from Per@@ th to att@@ ach the police , was un@@ successful , when he found himself in the sil@@ encing and sum@@ p@@ y waters , a few meters from a police offic@@ ers , who tried to re@@ hear@@ sed him , to re@@ verse him to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a household break in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , tried these to escape to them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I am not coming out , kom@@ m and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; do Sal@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too excited to make his Uni@@ form wet , therefore he turned a reliable tac@@ tic to - &quot; A good pol@@ ishing is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master@@ piece Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ine went to his car into the dit@@ ch , to det@@ ect a alcohol control and tried to swi@@ m over the Swan River to swi@@ m . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspir@@ ational one of the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ine bi@@ athlon .
&quot; Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards are embarrass@@ ed to stop him , and dro@@ p@@ ed to end the racing sport . &quot;
&quot; Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in its st@@ ables , to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he moved to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the Int@@ ellec@@ tual Department of Racing Victoria and argu@@ ed that they did a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race @-@ day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing sport and he found himself even under difficult conditions , when the positive co@@ b@@ alt hear@@ sal for Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned to 18 months due to the spi@@ on@@ age pre @-@ spic@@ y , and did not want it &quot; see how high hang@@ ing grap@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long to eat , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything is coming once again , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I must live with it what I have said . &quot;
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to be collected , and I want to think that my owners think I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start to think I do not , then I should not be more . &quot;
&quot; I have to think , what I do with my license . &quot;
previously the Moody &apos;s had to leave the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ating Department had tried to put his stack .
&quot; ahead of eight@@ een months , Terr@@ y B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian St@@ ewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and give him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their nos@@ es , because they try to grip myself . &quot;
&quot; Robert Roul@@ ston , former President of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , am@@ tier@@ ous president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of its time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring me this to the view that it is personally being personally ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L Cel@@ ebr@@ ate your@@ selves , and perhaps people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and to@@ w me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I am no matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pus@@ hing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ str@@ ating levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ going co@@ b@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said that he can throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known as well as his preparation for the un@@ swit@@ ched Master Caviar Online , the race tags is called &quot; &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; after a pack Schl@@ amm or sound was applied to the horse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has finally lift@@ ed mu@@ d on the leg .
it could have been so evening yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day that was so .
but it also had so on the race .
Moody could be confront@@ ed with a tri@@ mon@@ ary dis@@ qualified for treatment with the pack of the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who put these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far &quot; , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
man after depart@@ ures arrested
the police have arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent traffic in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the hel@@ icopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe inj@@ uries having been hit by a car at Sam@@ stag@@ morning at the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway .
&quot; the police said , the motor@@ cyclists further continued , without st@@ opping to help the last ri@@ ders . &quot;
on Monday a 50 years old man made up of Philip &apos;s police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be im@@ prison@@ ed due to depart@@ ures and ex@@ ecu@@ tives and due to other traffic delic@@ acies .

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y sugge@@ sts against ri@@ vals because of the asser@@ tion to Ring@@ strug@@ gling
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has criticism of the T@@ ackl@@ ing of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda Setting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robins@@ on said that the arbit@@ rat@@ ors of the Stor@@ m &apos;s players &apos; balance &apos; with his team during the high cancellation of the quali@@ fying @-@ finale in Sydney on Fri@@ day@@ break .
&quot; Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little dis@@ co@@ h@@ ated note about the Stor@@ m team , after his crew had the final victory against North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys at the Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample &quot; &quot; of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queens@@ land do not be &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ects the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; contact &quot; concentr@@ ates .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that criticism of two leading trainers in his crew de@@ pressed him , since it is concerned that they had wor@@ ries to be be@@ aten up of the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; that appears to be back again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robins@@ on on Ring@@ ers said , when they said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed our def@@ ensive system or techniques in the last six weeks , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ackl@@ es a real focus and that made us the Tr@@ end@@ wen@@ de . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent is now there for three years now , and he obviously got a great team to exercise . it is therefore probably not to lose but it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s just strange how this is always up to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts idea from the &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and re@@ minded of its ment@@ or , that B@@ enn@@ et St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared to Saturday at the Saturday evening with our at the evening , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tic@@ ised as a boring team and Wayne said that he will take a failure to take care of .
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ballo@@ on that you would like to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all its kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play them like this . &quot;
&quot; I build confidence on because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think about us when the Big Games went .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game Stor@@ m against ro@@ sters an higher result obtained than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is it a thr@@ illing game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not make any points of exciting ?
for me it is the sch@@ ed@@ ules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will get in a stage still to them . &quot;
&quot; Stor@@ m @-@ Team has free at this weekend , since they gained the right , either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the morning in A@@ AM@@ I Park . the ticket sales starts from the next service tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200@@ .000 $ Deposit to stim@@ ul@@ ant
&quot; a man that might be a life @-@ long pen@@ alty threat@@ ens because of his experim@@ ents , in the possession of 40 kil@@ o@@ grams of Kok@@ ain , which was failed to Queens@@ land for a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ rik@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal police force 100 kg of the drug upon the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via v@@ anu@@ atu and presented in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ rik@@ c has been observed , as he met his complic@@ ations during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police force 40 kil@@ o@@ grams of the Dro@@ ge in a To@@ y@@ ota E@@ cho . &quot;
&quot; despite having possibly pun@@ ishment pun@@ ishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of Kok@@ ain , argu@@ ed of the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ rik@@ c , that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot , and that in the cafe of a harm@@ less reason could be . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the flo@@ ck of Mak@@ si@@ rik@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the pen@@ alty he lost the police over his location .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and Sti@@ ef@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the original explanations of both persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollar represents a real financial burden , &quot; said judges Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; however , this alone will not be sufficient to hold it out of it , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ rik@@ c was released against damages , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his ser@@ ial pass , along with the police daily and holds a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g claims then to the offic@@ ers that he would have done so since it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and then &apos; announced , a polic@@ eman to be trou@@ bled to fri@@ ght@@ ened them . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ sec@@ tin Eil@@ id@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addi@@ ction that he is cute to fri@@ ght@@ ened humans . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the Search on the computer were carried out by him , but , it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to be fri@@ ght@@ ened to fri@@ ght@@ ened . &quot;
he was asked for his interviews with the unknown person who asked him the pictures and the he asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to get her .
&quot; he said , he is si@@ ck in the head , when he tr@@ acts , and said , he w@@ ool and then see pictures of rap@@ e and mur@@ der . &quot;

Lock on small border cross@@ es to Germany
&quot; however , more refugees will be away from the large continental roll@@ ment at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot;
many tr@@ ams made out of fear of discovery and capture the people in smaller border @-@ transi@@ tions
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spok@@ es@@ man of the Federal Police . &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years are show the motorway in the I@@ AA their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , mainly movement among the compact stri@@ kers , which are currently especially good for sale . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently especially in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of neutr@@ ality fell according to strength driving force ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( publication from 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concepts and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and luxury cars are presented in this year above all a lot of new compact models .
one of the biggest champ@@ agne for the German car is the Opel A@@ stra which will stand in autumn with the tr@@ aders .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair . &quot;
he is at the heart of the brand .
&quot; to this , the volume @-@ model also sold well , the new A@@ stra is also not much more expensive for it . &quot;
&quot; Opel provides an entrance on the main competit@@ or VW Golf in a view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs 16 990 .
the A@@ stra is available with a new 1.1 lit@@ re motor with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , H@@ esse provide further diesel and Petrol engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for the first time also three cylinder @-@ gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
&quot; other than the main competit@@ or VW Golf and Ford Focus , there is Opel A@@ stra first just as five Fif@@ th . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , who is already seen on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what is going on next to the A@@ stra at the I@@ AA remaining to new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sent the fourth generation of his A@@ stra competit@@ or Mé@@ gan@@ e race .
at the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only as five @-@ fold in a conventional and a high@@ lighted LED version .
in the trade he comes to trade at the beginning of next year but also a com@@ bi .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meter ten@@ elle are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Con@@ stitu@@ tional Court has given a Ex @-@ Hä@@ ft@@ ling of the Fo@@ al T@@ egel &apos;s T@@ egel , which was hous@@ ed in one to small cells . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners have always entitled to financial compensation when they are in small cells . &quot;
this has made the Federal Con@@ stitu@@ tional Court in a decision on Wednesday published on Wednesday .
&quot; those affected can even return the judges even then on money , if they were only a few days in the close to close rooms ( az . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; this was a Ex @-@ Hä@@ ft@@ ling with its constitu@@ tional compl@@ aint in Karlsruhe : he was hous@@ ed in the upper part of Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was sp@@ atial not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who had gone on an open foot after details of his j@@ une itself , into a greater cell has been displ@@ ac@@ ed . &quot;
his ministers compl@@ ying because of the un@@ worthy ar@@ den@@ dum to the land of Berlin .
&quot; yet , the constitu@@ tional mix@@ es are the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and pointed the case to re @-@ renewed the return there . &quot;
you see the man of man hur@@ t .
Kammer@@ chor now deci@@ des on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if from legal reasons for the frag@@ ile period only a few days of im@@ prison@@ ment for compensation , be a compensation , be called it . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a c@@ un@@ v@@ ate of the legal protection of the personality would be fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Action now has to clari@@ fy the amount of the compensation .
the constitu@@ tional mix@@ es have often been strengthened in the past often the rights of criminal prisoners .
&quot; thus , they said only in April of a ha@@ ft@@ ling off@@ ense , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human dignity is also a decision from 2011 , also the multi @-@ Flyer out of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe confirmed in addition to the Berlin Ver@@ stitu@@ tional Court , who had a joint submission in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the actual fact was accommod@@ ated about three months , daily between 15 to 21 hours in such a cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin prison have also come into the head@@ lines in the last few weeks .
&quot; prisoners will therefore again be closed again 23 hours , the ag@@ gressi@@ veness rises to Him@@ self , even because of the ten@@ se situation had already come . &quot;
&quot; after information of the judi@@ cial performance are 21 places in T@@ egel because of des@@ sert , 19 shall be away from 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ or is decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forec@@ asts of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , after statement by vice @-@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to ab@@ sorb a million refugees . &quot;
German Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can create it and we will create it .
what is coming to Germany convey@@ s the following overview .
&quot; used by different forec@@ asts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , each year - and the next five years . &quot;
that &apos;s almost twice as much as has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but especially with affordable r@@ arities : each year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 separate apartments from the rental price , and around these particularly cheap apartments are also eligi@@ ble for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double more double , of currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing every year , and this would have to invest an promotion of 6.6 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; one agree to scientists and the Federal Ministry of State in this , that it also has to give more tax benefits for investments into the construction of housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the estimates by the Institute for labour market and professional research , that long @-@ term 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not only be system@@ atically asked for their qualification to help them to get started immediately , cri@@ tic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in the Bert@@ els@@ mann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees but crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the este@@ em in the Rec@@ on@@ ation Society , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of the immig@@ rants , said refuge@@ e Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there was a political turn in Germany : from the working ban for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while it was previously an un@@ employed for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this in November 2014 was reduced to three months , as well as the resi@@ dual damage , the asylum seek@@ ers will be limited to one place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society itself , too - because of the discipl@@ in@@ ism - mostly the view is enabled faster , access to the labour market should be possible . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of knowledge .
&quot; so far , there is still no applic@@ ant offer to general and pro@@ sec@@ tional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most commonly used by personal contacts .
&quot; consequently , the creation of networks is therefore to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ way to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has revealed that only a few is the parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated that ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ent@@ ail parents &quot; , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ inn@@ able , rec@@ iter for youth and family at the Berlin Sen@@ ator administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distributed the management board in various languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators are strongly rising by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Sen@@ ator would try to increase educational institutions - about to appro@@ ve more medical schools . &quot;
in the countries they are prepared students in welcome classes in welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by full trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a branch language . &quot;
&quot; there is no def@@ ect to them , Be@@ ate St@@ even says of the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle not a state asylum seek@@ ers or thought , the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) , his attitude finds now but abandoned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; study @-@ in refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university access to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a residence or di@@ vor@@ ce do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , more if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; latter will not receive any BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they are not covered by the circle of b@@ af@@ pay@@ able persons . &quot;
&quot; the refugees had to lived in Germany so far for four years to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligi@@ ble , from January 1st 2016 , this sp@@ anne is at 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial gap must be closed but also for Steffen KR@@ ACH , Ber@@ lins Staats@@ secret@@ ary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately receive BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role because many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion of important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should respect Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches to develop into a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; important , it would also be the establishment of an Islamic benef@@ ici@@ aries , which is professional around the an@@ chor . &quot;
on the rights there are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree to clear and agree with the state in many areas and to bring some control possibilities . &quot;
this also belongs to the willingness to prepare against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ ic@@ ed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be hin@@ dered to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , they immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , said , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a theme of the whole society today . &quot;
&quot; thus , the majority of society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is dr@@ ill . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Germany has been a result of European decisions - since one more than a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; however , it works very slowly , like the NS@@ U @-@ m@@ uth series , in the police and authorities the raci@@ al moti@@ ve system system@@ atically ignored . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and those interested groups are under@@ taken for long and why international tre@@ aties such as anti @-@ raci@@ al muscles , Germany must become reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking in Germany , Germany was able to provide the previously anticip@@ ated refugees medical , argu@@ ed physi@@ cians Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities affects , we do this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there is extra money to flow into the system . &quot;
to avoid Eng@@ p@@ asses , ur@@ ges Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all com@@ ers simultaneously on registration health @-@ cards . &quot;
that services could be counted later with the federal states .
&quot; and long @-@ term , it is highly ques@@ tion@@ able , so many people with the limited catalogue katalog , the asylum seek@@ ers Act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make sure to create the language bar@@ riers , especially the language bar@@ riers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin Health schol@@ ars has proven to be established in The@@ a Bor@@ de that immig@@ rants be upgr@@ aded to their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in the medical practice of interpre@@ ter would have to pay for interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees would have been helped with more general medical arri@@ vals in the emergency unit . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; among the refuge@@ e currency , there may be clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the youth enter it around HIV Inf@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other path@@ ways , German doctors of their education are however clear , um@@ t Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; par@@ as@@ it@@ osis or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to det@@ ect . and what the physi@@ ologi@@ an affects , be bl@@ ur@@ ably even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ rian would have a high @-@ development education system , several refugees and even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to apply for practic@@ ing , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and men@@ op@@ tionally better checks . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to the estimates of the German psychotherap@@ ist Chamber of psychotherap@@ ist , most suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress @-@ disorder or under depression . &quot;
&quot; vulner@@ able refuge@@ e quot@@ ations , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of the TU München occup@@ ies that every fifth sy@@ rian refuge@@ e is traumatic stress in Germany .
&quot; who is stu@@ ff@@ ed at a post@@ trau@@ mati@@ cal loads , suffering from among other things on the so @-@ called Fl@@ ash@@ backs with resp@@ ir@@ atory , weak@@ ling and death pen@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping , and concentr@@ ates , strong adhesi@@ on and emoti@@ onal num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms were chr@@ onic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ic cran@@ ks refugees have been a psychotherap@@ y . &quot;
&quot; though , psych@@ olog@@ ically si@@ c seek@@ ers cannot place an application for a psychotherap@@ y , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of animal workers or doctors , which are not trained for the mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead to failure to harm , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dreams
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; g@@ rei@@ ft the Circus come back to the traditions of circles .
the goal is to pull any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , veterin@@ arian and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus move into the Man@@ ege on the bri@@ cks and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie &quot; , Tier@@ lehr@@ er and Juni@@ orch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto the current man@@ bi@@ dity faces . &quot;
for over 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family .
the gift to insp@@ ire the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important to bring people away from their everyday di@@ ary , and participate in a completely different world for two hours , st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year e@@ ager . &quot;

50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the programme of the cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with tal@@ ented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ low@@ n Family moves the audience with joke and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Casti@@ llo Br@@ others understand their craft .
with the her@@ oes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ um there will be the Cu@@ ban du@@ cker .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art at the m@@ ast is supposed to con@@ quer the cru@@ ise in the storm .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; st@@ ressed Stephan@@ ie mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cus@@ es are only too often topic on various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Stephan@@ ie &apos;s also takes place : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different contin@@ ents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , the possibility of every desire to be read from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel , it will not want to take into the Man@@ ege . &quot;
so the highest pre@@ cep@@ ot is : good for the animals make sure .
&quot; especially for its z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a t@@ ebra , the family is pro@@ ud@@ ly proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived eight years in a cr@@ ad@@ le and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little j@@ um@@ bo da , he tells Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
for each visitor it is likely to be something like that .
&quot; one is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie &quot; there : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert M@@ ug@@ abe keeps the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr M@@ ug@@ abe , Africa El@@ s leader , the beginning of the year fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
he did not viol@@ ate but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
&quot; the opening of the parliament was bap@@ tis@@ ed by the claims of the opposition of the opposition , that they had received an@@ onym@@ ously deaths , and they were war@@ ned that the address of Mr M@@ ug@@ abe were called by Mr M@@ ug@@ abe . &quot;
last month she asked him and bro@@ ke him during his talk about the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he returned on Tuesday .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.@@ 000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25 @-@ 000 to 30.@@ 000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the services of the company .
HP will be able to divi@@ de companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its rapid growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job construction leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars over the fourth quarter , HP called in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable competitive costs for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Meg Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which should lead the unit according to the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is getting smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops to support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for businesses &quot; , &quot; such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it is granted a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Hu@@ o Alto , where the Pal@@ o Alto are named &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
HP has massive restructuring in order to tackle the re@@ vers@@ al of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world of two @-@ largest PC producers and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area , based on con@@ vic@@ tion that elev@@ ated companies a better performance . &quot;
FC Ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that Team@@ colony are facing the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the latest Jack Wil@@ s@@ here
&quot; W@@ enger emphas@@ ized towards Wil@@ s@@ here that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario signi@@ fies that Wil@@ s@@ here are sure to miss the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer on the European Championships is certainly un@@ certain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ s@@ here had finished the last season after a separate button hur@@ ling , and then returned to his old moment@@ um during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that does not he@@ aled .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his bending or with the inj@@ uries that he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true of purely medical sight , but as W@@ enger also recognised , there is the related risk of any injury , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Premier In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd lists 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ s@@ here since his deb@@ ut 6 years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ atures in the last five games times .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight game@@ play times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have to record most vulner@@ ability days .
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a de@@ struc@@ tible bond , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability shows during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from a injury , you have a acci@@ dental period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win out combat . &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
&quot; I hope to stabil@@ ized his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will make a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ sen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on the coming Wednesday , and W@@ enger inv@@ ests itself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ ct@@ or Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta is likely to start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Th@@ eo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small po@@ ign@@ ation of mind , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although Ar@@ sen@@ al favor@@ ites are , through Group F share , the Mak@@ si@@ mir St@@ adion in Zagreb is one of the players with the largest in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also still be@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake where measured on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.0 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has moved from the last season with the Champions League campaign against Monaco and remains of the far hope , with his management the association at its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked at Ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly in terms of how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mur@@ dered among young men at a 15 @-@ year Ho@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death @-@ ache in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains often more common among men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem announced the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ain@@ st Living Mis@@ er@@ ati ( calm - campaign against a civil life ) 2015 as the year of man , to seek to seek the culture in question , to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart in the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,@@ 000 High School students , with depres@@ san@@ ven Sy@@ mp@@ tom noticed that when conduct@@ ing a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; had doubl@@ ed its opportunities in healing . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , half a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one has only once to have friends to work so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of over social media , communication with its focus on style about substance is often more important than a mean@@ ing@@ ful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , essential and successful to appear , dou@@ bles , even if in reality the ins@@ ation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at expense of intr@@ insi@@ c value - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much profound . &quot;
and like a video @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really do not buy . &quot;
&quot; the beauty at Friends was , that this shift was placed on the head . &quot;
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which is by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hug@@ s , moments of the football gu@@ ing in cozy ch@@ okes and the long@@ ing from Ros@@ s to Rach@@ el - all that came out of knowledge , even if they can often keep themselves back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a employee of teleph@@ oning to me explained : ... &quot; my listen@@ ings to people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ ord@@ onn@@ able , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old ref@@ ence &quot; &quot; I com@@ mu@@ te with it &quot; &quot; has a tremend@@ ous effect as the feeling that it is percei@@ ved as weak@@ ness when you speak about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind if I try to offer , longer @-@ term surveillance mechanisms . &quot;
it presents very clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ der @-@ status of the phone to the people in eye view of the desp@@ air also likes , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally new designed back@@ drop , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;

di Maria meets to help Malm@@ ö to mal@@ mal@@ men
angel Di Maria celebr@@ ates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his first hit against Hun@@ edo@@ ara .
&quot; di Maria meets his deb@@ ut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps , to passing on Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the review and reaction to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the prince at on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ate as PSG players who brought the French Masters on the way , but there@@ after they cont@@ ests a number of opportunities before they finally reached its lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a post@@ heads . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the Group A needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , since they did not only strive for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ R@@ unden , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they have got the points , it was not a class set of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s desp@@ aired later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with whom he began his favorite career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ hill in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win to show our enemies , even though there are certain things we must be perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good pre@@ mark . &quot;
we wanted to win and we won it even though I regre@@ t that we won &apos;t have one or two more goals .
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his sentence in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was finished in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian tur@@ bul@@ ent was considered the man , which has been taken over the next level in Europe , and he pointed out , why , when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he joined Johan Wil@@ and over nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if someone believ@@ ed that a great victory would be achieved , that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stood at an@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation players on the field and was thr@@ illed with a five @-@ man defence , and two deep in the center@@ field , an grave opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except a p@@ uss of Nik@@ ola D@@ egu@@ dy@@ ic , who passing far from Kevin Ko@@ h P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute and passed it little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead there were sometimes sometimes on , with some mis@@ sil@@ es and bad choices , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was not least inhab@@ ited by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which at no less than five verses alone , after Cav@@ ani it was started after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria had brought into a screen@@ shot , which was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten pas@@ sover ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate fell finally short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uru@@ mea has had its six@@ ty seasons , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had a left f@@ lange of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts on that Malm@@ ö into the game could come back , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before substitute E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish le@@ ague , which has not the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fying games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

matt dam plays diversity in film
matt dam pre@@ led the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said they won &apos;t need behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as this the need for alternative perspectives st@@ ressed and indeed related to a black prot@@ ag@@ onists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do during the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show &quot; , &quot; in@@ sured damage . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with bel@@ lied un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the acting of The Marti@@ an himself . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown C@@ los@@ ed the Produ@@ zent@@ enk@@ ol@@ lay Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ r@@ elly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want people to think about how to think - who is always the director , - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is be@@ aten by their white listen@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ s Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio to the director of Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for the director of the rights to the film ; Dam@@ on could tell us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;

&quot; the Twe@@ et has been served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,@@ 000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on comments come at a time , at the exact raci@@ al representation in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement in Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter may have much effect and ur@@ ged leg@@ is@@ lator and authorities , dis@@ crimin@@ atory practices against colour co@@ hesion . &quot;

&quot; album silent Hill , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said he . &quot;
&quot; as books and black lives , there is still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in younger time , leaders of Black Li@@ ves have published a statement and may be viewed as a reaction to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ selb@@ ach , if the group should be regarded as a h@@ ate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;

&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I wanted to tell me , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt welcomed , when I started and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches since the third one . &quot;
&quot; after they received in the first the Lead@@ off bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ky gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian K@@ ins@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .

man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ ic@@ y @-@ sweet .
&quot; but who wants to respect his sl@@ ender , which is often more likely to get out of them . &quot;
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - above all Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. on all contain man@@ gos , but much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who is the fruit is@@ st , supports thus visual , immune system and met@@ abo@@ lic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or to be fixed and pleas@@ antly dist@@ ur@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; the sh@@ ining color alone says nothing about how and the fruit is - so you can also taste green Man@@ gos very tasty . &quot;
they should be consum@@ ed at the room temperature and can be consum@@ ed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet food .
but a man@@ go gives also a sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it mil@@ estone the slightly bit@@ ter taste man@@ holes like Chic@@ or@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , p@@ oul@@ try , Lamb and Wild . &quot;

Rome now has an Martin @-@ Luther square
&quot; just 500 years after the Re@@ formation , there is now an Martin @-@ Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of town @-@ President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino became a first @-@ named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , on the name of the German reform@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he said now as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of Re@@ formation &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome right next to the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the team@@ work of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the p@@ onies over centuries as minority often were able to live only in conc@@ eal@@ ment their faith . &quot;
with the place I become visible in symbo@@ lic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian for the annual closing of 1510 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as promised .
his negative impressions should lead him to the view of hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later battle against Rome .
Luther was then initi@@ ated with his thes@@ es against the deport@@ ation of the deport@@ ation of the deport@@ ation church .
hammer artist invest three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( tast@@ ed ) Dorn@@ enk@@ r@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible has been painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated by bi@@ kers .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with gorgeous images . &quot;
at the beginning the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt that has form@@ ulated in 150 moti@@ ves his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of Bibli@@ cal stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be adapted , this can quite be quite dark . &quot;
around three years Ot@@ mar Alt at his Bible project has worked for he met a subj@@ ective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
&quot; emerged are cycles , which de@@ vote themselves topics like clo@@ ister , pl@@ agues , bi@@ det or fa@@ ther@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; with it , he has fascin@@ ated spont@@ aneously thanks to several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art@@ books . &quot;
and above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is based on the painting based on the painting .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible in the selected Bible , and so into the lo@@ ot , in current co@@ her@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this texts are like Verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; if they are embedded between the original Bi@@ bel@@ z@@ itat , and each one set of the artist , who are form@@ ulated here to their very personal thoughts for the particular situation . &quot;
the cl@@ ing@@ band has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equ@@ als twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately still trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , from a family who belong@@ ed to a family who belong@@ ed to the str@@ ing@@ ent rul@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing already came with the tube , &quot; re@@ members of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work to work , to wear it again with the Lord father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art in high @-@ speed up time to help : &quot; &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ten is shaped today , and that is nois@@ y . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is there being displ@@ ac@@ ed .
artists have a different l@@ ust and w@@ onne to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let themselves show the spect@@ ator into the pictures &quot; &quot; let them appear , discover and feeling what power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture looks for its object . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; I like to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like , as he travel@@ ed with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I do not agree to det@@ ect the Bible completely , but that is important for him as well , mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; was a pictures of the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to negoti@@ ate his life to deep and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for furnish@@ ing both the ( bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ yon pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start @-@ up for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn na@@ ht
&quot; plans have been found , place found , enterprises assigned to flo@@ oring for a round @-@ course : one year later it was almost all done - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X turn was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration f@@ enced for displ@@ ac@@ ement , especially among the owners who did not appro@@ ve the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill down@@ stairs , new place - now wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will go in October , the First Mun@@ icip@@ al Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now divi@@ de in the children and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year has happened again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it will then be started without &quot; further memorial &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B supports its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga are putting a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the so@@ ccer is respon@@ ding to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in addressing the issues related to the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification .
&quot; there may be no one in principle , that goes nothing but I have nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in particular interest , this subject to get a grip on , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chanc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refuge@@ e situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ ular and monkey there the state Chanc@@ ell@@ or &apos;s wife Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; then the subject will surely play a central role , he announced . &quot;
the football could help and w@@ ool .
but the decisive ch@@ efs must ask the policies .
the German football association has therefore expanded its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for an welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of U@@ EF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ liga support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ge continue a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ kot@@ ia instead of the usual usual sponsor@@ ships ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; We will help - # mi@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make sure that all should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Lever@@ kus@@ en Sport@@ chef Rud@@ i V@@ ö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; Image ( Tuesday ) , and referred to the project as &quot; &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is every part , it is not allowed to see any one . &quot;
&quot; we can football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already been so incredibly out@@ fit , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; Hoff@@ en@@ hei@@ ms managing director Peter Ret@@ r spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of le@@ ague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the EM @-@ quali@@ fying game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach , supported the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large commun@@ ill of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ enc@@ ers have started its own projects would have been made great .
just as great that small and smallest associations are there active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , who we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
in this and the next year the association awarded with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already announced the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; said N@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP view@@ points loses in accident an eye
&quot; the pre @-@ president of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has several reports to be lost by a fall in early July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; after the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA he was after mid@@ night in a water glass , which he laid down in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost wick@@ ed , was power@@ less , then came out of sex on the road - that he told us the last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so plat@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , but his work could go . &quot;
&quot; early October we meet before the supervis@@ ory meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said thr@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 years old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully unemployment . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days notice ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to guide the software owners . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of Haz@@ so Platt@@ ling , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t p@@ end@@ elt is usually between Germany and the USA , since the summer he was no longer in German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him with such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen &quot;
&quot; important is to be up , once you go down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement for Mag@@ n@@ ussen except skir@@ m@@ ishes ...
&quot; Mag@@ n@@ ussen twit@@ ter@@ te a corresponding photo and explained , he suffered the injury to suffered from the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes to the desc@@ end of Singapore at the weekend as little as a reserve for the two do@@ ig@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button intimate , as a week later at the Great Prize of Japan . &quot;
football : b@@ v@@ b without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eb@@ ack of Marco Re@@ us will finally strike the first group game of Europa League . &quot;
the National @-@ player is also lack@@ ing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot go back to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ game against Lever@@ kus@@ en once again , the BV@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high stress of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its gene@@ tic position just on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
thus he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Weiden@@ f@@ eller is taking the place by regular man Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , lob@@ by@@ ing the football teacher the world master . &quot;
&quot; whether the Weiden@@ f@@ eller in the future will be used in all the Europa League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left but open . &quot;
&quot; with high prob@@ ability , he will continue to ride the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ no@@ ble statement of Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the final statement for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has its goal , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian F@@ gl for in@@ understand@@ able : &quot; &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ auto@@ s : government wants to be stre@@ aming for Germany
&quot; in Germany , Germany shall be leading to the will of the federal government in changing the car of technological endeav@@ ors . &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic seminar from the house of Transportation Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) that provides investing in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new mobile Age &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked chassis will raise the road safety and provide less steel , said do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part of the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry . &quot;
the Strateg@@ ic ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport st@@ resses the importance of mobile Broad@@ band performed and a swi@@ ft@@ ly as@@ cent on digital audio radio .
the testing of new technique is currently taking a test ride on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; with the drivers &quot; no extra cost risks , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany want to emplo@@ y around internationally for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars of 10 to 130 St@@ und@@ enk@@ öpfe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government aims to emplo@@ y a change in the Vienna Convention which so far only the human being seen as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over in increasing measure the car the guidance , the driver becomes more and more to passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; after one from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving in motor@@ ways to 2020 will be possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , drive @-@ over vehicles on public roads can be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving functions at the Federal Republic of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the plant can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in acci@@ dents and the security of the personal data of the drivers are clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
yet the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Laboratory DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the result , that only eight percent of Germans believe in the coming decade , 32 percent do not expect in 20 years to believe 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France 21 percent of survey until 2025 with autonom@@ ous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ running vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of the association Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would be able to complete control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that could be in flow@@ ing traffic after 15 per cent , in the tri@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every Voc@@ ated would not exc@@ eed the car in control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says Team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM beginning
Düssel@@ dorfer wants to compete in the last update from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge , good for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , also without Tim@@ o the title &quot; , &quot; said Bun@@ dest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ g@@ head during the EM @-@ teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was at this time the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot;
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer a clear@@ er favorite , &quot; said Single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who led the se@@ eger@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but re@@ minded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ rein@@ er . &quot;
&quot; then Tim@@ o also has f@@ ond , and we are Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; in this case we should be oriented towards us , &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ lists @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English football @-@ nation Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United had a serious bre@@ ach of the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , the def@@ en@@ ders was hit at a t@@ ackl@@ ing of Hé@@ ct@@ or Mor@@ eno and after long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis was clearly marked with the 20 years old leaders of Bas@@ tian &apos;s pig to one track .
Gaul@@ ist feels too old for a du@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite big mo@@ den@@ schau and a vig@@ il@@ ant gre@@ ens &quot; Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that is fri@@ ght@@ ening thanks to Video@@ ren@@ tions .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of French design who became among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great Star of the Mo@@ des@@ z@@ ene - and so that he put men into sk@@ irts .
&quot; I cannot say that I am no longer , that I am the En@@ f@@ ant at the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was easy , now it is genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the 18th September to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a fort@@ une that the mod@@ elling has changed his initial attitude toward a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he had been against it , for : &quot; for me a show has been a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
if you die , you get to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it comes to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
exhibits can give an insight into the barely over@@ looked by man who has written Mo@@ de@@ Story without ever having a training .
&quot; chron@@ olog@@ ically , the show is not built , but it is a great chore@@ ographi@@ ed total art work , for which much effort was operated by the doll@@ s , for example is a sty@@ ling is engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have the power according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot after Munich .
&quot; shortly before the start of the October , there was a special offer : a leather@@ cord with cor@@ rupt . &quot;
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in severe women ( &quot; women are sl@@ ur@@ ned than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delic@@ ate mo@@ c ear as well as the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student , and bad@@ ly in football ) he made his Teddy Bear , and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the dism@@ is@@ sal of fashion he subsequently returned itself .
&quot; he sto@@ dian of Mo@@ de@@ als , and saw themselves the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought the then but of course .
for his first own mo@@ den@@ schau he did not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , was allowed to keep the plumbing . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
formerly we went to the long stick@@ ers in and around Pl@@ auen about it .
&quot; the stick@@ ed substances and points were created in great amount of customers , they were further elabor@@ ated for example to blan@@ kets and c@@ ardin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ist@@ it@@ ze Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
at the starting times the pl@@ au@@ ener tip played fashion a greater role then has been displ@@ ac@@ ed by the Heim@@ yers and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry making accessories such as bags and for regional tr@@ ays .
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is bor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ed to the past of styl@@ istic periods , a rise of order potential . &quot;
&quot; who is not served in the textile industry in Germany , no more on the market . &quot;
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ urs@@ it@@ ze Pl@@ auen is a member of nine further companies member of the association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
roughly 80 percent of revenue generated about 80 percent of the revenues in the past 15 years .
private stores and wholesale trade fairs are almost no more .
our products reach the customer in this way too .
&quot; nowadays , the mass ware will be much cheaper at the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the export of up to Russia and to the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association has also tried through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we lead a quality seal , that shows that we produce environ@@ mentally and soci@@ ally responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complements : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ a U@@ te Schmidt teaching at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Stadt Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroider@@ ies and points .
&quot; to use the competition from the Asian region , one needs to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses , which must be mainly economically thinking , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only easy to maintain a customer . &quot;
a few years ago covering textile design@@ ation Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic snow @-@ tip new .
the machine cli@@ cks the machine to some places small chic@@ ks .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed@@ em@@ mel in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ sau@@ ce was inspired from it , &quot; previously I could not start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now it uses the snow @-@ point for their jewelry .
in a consum@@ ing method she shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who wish to give a re@@ member@@ ing . &quot;
this way I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

EU wants to double mer@@ cur@@ y @-@ border in noise @-@ leather
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for Mercur@@ y in large quantities , and the consumers thereby raise a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is present an appropriate working paper in the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ lack of industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full W@@ anted of pregnancy and inf@@ ants &quot; , &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the bound@@ aries of the nervous system should be raised to large fish at the end of the food chain like Hai@@ der or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; by one to two milli@@ gram Mercur@@ y each kil@@ o@@ grams of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , great noise @-@ fish are already taken so strong with Mercur@@ y , that on the basis of the still prev@@ ailing bound@@ ary values , about 50 percent of the length can not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dup@@ lication of the border values , then only 14.5 percent would be un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this Lock@@ Tec wants to shar@@ p the EU according to Food@@ watch the limits values in other fish , from currently 0.5@@ Milli@@ ram to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; but thanks , this , however , this referred to as &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because small Fried@@ fish , such as carp usually are usually so low , that they have already observed the planned numbers already today . &quot;
&quot; the lo@@ wering at low is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ der de@@ fl@@ ection man@@ eu@@ ver , which helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mercur@@ y is one for the people of high @-@ tox@@ ic heavy met@@ als that suff@@ ice over the food chain especially in noise .
the German government war@@ ns therefore that &apos; cause little amounts of especially in un@@ born inj@@ uries of the nervous system .
the German Federal Ministry is explained on its homepage with regard to the current maximum value but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; do not expect to be expected .
Mercur@@ y ends above all through the co@@ hesion of the co@@ hesion .
&quot; according to the German coal power plants , according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry of the Green @-@ Bundestag , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of Mercur@@ y in the year , two thir@@ ds of the plant in Germany emitt@@ ed total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of Mercur@@ y in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube be &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covered &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted in March out of paper . &quot;
last year European war@@ nings of Mercur@@ y in fish are already one of the most common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
