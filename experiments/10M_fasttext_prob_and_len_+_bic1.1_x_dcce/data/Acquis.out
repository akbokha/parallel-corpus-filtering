&quot; C ) leaves kernel material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or the process phase , in which it is made , or is introduced to the core material or else , in a later stage of the core metabolism of the core material in the states , so it is subject to the other in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the security measures envisaged in this Convention shall not be completed for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community is subject to the recognition of core material , the backup measures based on this Convention is not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and community to each other through the application of suitable backup measures . &quot;

agreements in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ l@@ ements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the medium term financial assistance
&quot; the BI@@ Z could include Stand@@ by @-@ credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tors , when the banks apply a corresponding request . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could not be closed until the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor &apos;s credi@@ tation on the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 bn units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future versions of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , here are some conditions mentioned below , to their use the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; at any stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of reloc@@ ated stocks , without being exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; during the opening of the loans , as well as the extension extension the BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening of credit . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the initial draw would not be made before expiry of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would be made available at the BC@@ Z in conclusion of the Agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time zones , taking into account the funds from the bank , expected three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who apply the BI@@ Z at the respective time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely match the market sets . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to create the necessary means even on the market , then the application could reach a maximum of interest rate , which corresponds to the corresponding Mar@@ ge heigh@@ ted Li@@ bor . &quot;

&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human blood , from which the largest part of plasma is removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of unity , from which it has been won ; other blood cells components can be present or can be partially removed . &quot;
the liquid content of the concentration camp consists either of the remaining plasma or from an appropriate is@@ ot@@ onic artificial complex solution that has been placed after removing the plastic .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , the approximate percentage of red blood cells may be used ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) on the label . &quot;

&quot; without regard to whether the end product is to be flu@@ ently or dry , the preparation must have been heated to an appropriate stabili@@ zer condition in the final tank for 10 hours on 60 C ± 0.5 C to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the I@@ no@@ isse@@ ation@@ Auth@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in preparations from human rights , at least 95 % of the mass of existing proteins must be converted . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin G are available per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ product is free@@ ze , so it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;

&quot; the normal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is an preparation of plastic map@@ le , which was made of human , the antibodies of normal adult in the whole blood . &quot;
the applied manufacturing method must ensure that the end product transm@@ its the terms and conditions described below and does not transfer any I@@ no@@ bility she@@ eting .
&quot; moreover , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies in the output product are concentrated in a sufficient amount . &quot;
&quot; the method is satisfactory for every end product in this respect , if in the starting point and the final product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial toxicity . &quot;
&quot; during the manufacture , there may be no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacterial substance ; to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the end product , allow him to be suitable preser@@ vatives and an appropriate stabil@@ isation . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood vessels can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to increase the effectiveness and conservation of the stability of the process . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective proportion . &quot;
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain substances of human origin .
