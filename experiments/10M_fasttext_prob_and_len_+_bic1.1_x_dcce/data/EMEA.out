this document is a summary of the European Public Holidays report ( EP@@ AR ) in which research committee will be assessed as the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that arise in the mouth ) , as a solution to one ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ led thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not available ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ enne @-@ I disorder , an mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods ab@@ normal high @-@ tuning ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe , serious Man@@ ical episodes and the prevention of man@@ ical episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for quick control of stolen anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces when the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; on both diseases , the solution can take for one or the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins in patients who are preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who simultaneously take other medicines , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ as pra@@ zo@@ le probably works as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ as pra@@ zo@@ le like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters works to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin plays a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ le contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms , and their recovery is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the re@@ discovery of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that compared with a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was aged over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ surgery , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent the re@@ issue , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that led by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , change in symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients said to the treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies by investig@@ ating how the body absor@@ bs the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ tes and the solution to get absorbed ( up ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients showed the Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms stri@@ pped anxiety as the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five Kur@@ zz studies have been more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy , in addition , up to 74 weeks of more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes have been treated with previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms stri@@ pped anxiety and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ y@@ ram@@ ental distur@@ ban@@ ces ) , ac@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , ruin and exhaus@@ tion , ruin ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Care ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , the predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes said to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , opposite the risks . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the quick control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes , if a oral therapy is not suitable to predomin@@ ate the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of be@@ et disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a holding dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
a increased effectiveness in doses of a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or composite therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ ased disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient , a lower initi@@ ating dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is made from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the start or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that there was no increase in patients with bi@@ polar disorder in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ otic disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ra or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic cardi@@ ac disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ite form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ es : in clinical studies , which resulted in a year or less continuous , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; when working with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ati@@ ment plan should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ le should be associated with patients with cranes in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states that are associated with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients had been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , an increased mortality in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and the contact for unwanted zer@@ oes events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ oni or hy@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events associated with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated with the direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of a deterioration of the glu@@ cose values . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic ties , which is known as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and might lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le on the central bank system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as Se@@ enco@@ ding ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the remains of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , whereby this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy prob@@ es increased a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should have similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ alli@@ sts .
&quot; when looking into consideration the joint G@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should outw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants , likely to have similar effects and therefore should have similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; after deri@@ ving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted on the dosage level before beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le a day does not contain significant effect on the met@@ alli@@ s of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ p@@ hic ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should get advised to notify their physician if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the resulting concern , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic patients should be warned of the patients before , hazardous machines , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than on plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks joined in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le with a total of reduced incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) from EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ j@@ ines@@ ie , compared to patients who were treated with neck dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under ov@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ stro @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under half @-@ surgery treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term experience over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the routine laboratory parameters appeared , not medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine phosph@@ ate phosph@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3,5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le patients , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects which may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , sp@@ in@@ sti@@ p@@ hic events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical studies and since the introduction of un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional tak@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
&quot; although there are no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ ac@@ aly@@ sis with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit is , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le has a high plasma . &quot;
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ otonin has been convey@@ ed over the combination of a particip@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and an excessive aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and for hi@@ st@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; at G@@ abe of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in doses from 0,5 up to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy prob@@ es showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction of bonds of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or Lig@@ anden , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le compared to plac@@ ebo a statis@@ tically significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a half @-@ operation survey conducted in week 52 of the proportion of Res@@ p@@ onder patients who held an attack on the study medication , in both groups similarly ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le 77 % and Hal@@ operated dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at semi @-@ operated dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed itself a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le Group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study at schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , joined by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value patient data sets ) in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the output level ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the be@@ et @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le showed a opposite plac@@ ebo in@@ superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fix dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the be@@ et @-@ disorder presented Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le compared to plac@@ ebo no excessive effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le showed a opposite plac@@ ebo in@@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and an un@@ stable effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium or semi @-@ surgery in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le also pointed out a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , like li@@ thium or semi @-@ surgery . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ anti @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the previous therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le yiel@@ ded a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached an re@@ mission compared to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back , predominantly in preventing a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the stretching and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ regulation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle Eli@@ min@@ atory period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le with exten@@ sive met@@ alli@@ sts via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximate 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , there are no differences in the phar@@ ac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
one @-@ specific analysis of Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics resulted in no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking on the phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le .
the pharmac@@ ological properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le and Deh@@ de@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy pro@@ aches .
&quot; a single dose study at Pro@@ b@@ anden with different eng@@ agements liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le and Deh@@ de@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , but the study summ@@ ed up only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw s@@ napshots on their met@@ ric capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on the security code , toxicity , toxicity , reproduction , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , and the Canarian potential let the prec@@ clinical data have no special dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; To@@ xi@@ k@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which has significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects used as a dos@@ is@@ dependent of bovine species of bovine animals ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ments and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ymers ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) and an increase by secondary schools at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) .
in addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the removal of Sul@@ ph@@ onic con@@ ju@@ g@@ ums of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in the g@@ alle of monkey after repeti@@ tive fe@@ eders of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; however , the concentrations in the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le are no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study on 39 weeks in the g@@ alle of monkey and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the sol@@ vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; at rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages that resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le is 10 or 15 mg / day at a holding dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
patients who have difficulty in the swal@@ lowing of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets may take the melt table alternatively to A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders also reported in some cases after the start or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

&quot; the effectiveness of Er@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , attended by 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters in the past had a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with ins@@ x@@ ane patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines . &quot;
one regards only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer in terms of the efficacy of the disease and the survival of the disease and survival .
&quot; in contrast , patients showed themselves in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that S@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines . &quot;
&quot; it may also be applied not in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the beginning of the treatment low neutr@@ ro@@ philosophi@@ es in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Aids ( CH@@ MP ) has fixed that the first treatment is no longer considered to be more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , and that it must not be used in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 shared the European Commission of Er@@ ror Bio@@ Science Limited appro@@ ve for the transport of In@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
&quot; abra@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indi@@ ces for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ mac@@ ular disease in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed , and for which a default anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ philosophi@@ es &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory n@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie during erection x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced in the subsequent series on 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; with sensory N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie Grad 3 the treatment is to be interrupted , until a recovery is achieved at level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; abra@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ ane is an album @-@ based nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulated formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which might have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be deduc@@ ted and an symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated once again with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients there should be no renewed abra@@ sive treatment cycles , until the neutr@@ ro@@ philosophi@@ es increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ ru@@ sion number increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with ser@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a un@@ ambiguous with ins@@ ane in connection of cardi@@ x@@ ter@@ toxicity were not proven , cardi@@ ogen@@ ic inci@@ dents in the indi@@ ces of patients are not uncommon , especially in patients with former anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lun@@ ar disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Er@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ as@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ cking means . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ sion should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not applied to effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoidable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should be used during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Er@@ x@@ ane treatment method .
male patients treated with abra@@ sion is recommended while and up to six months after treatment there is no child to bear witness .
male patients should be advised prior to treating a sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ ation since the therapy with li@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
&quot; abra@@ sion can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can affect the per@@ sever@@ ity and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed at 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ zin@@ om , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of x@@ ane . &quot;

the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching export distribution and / or past@@ oral connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ ological properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ uble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human@@ ly liver micro@@ some and tissue processes that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily reported to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephalopathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pi@@ erc@@ ing head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there is no allergic reactions triggered . &quot;

&quot; an@@ a@@ emia and fol@@ li@@ graphy may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and illness condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ ins by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally patients can occasionally be observed in a patient with an individual bun@@ ge@@ of glo@@ bin@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; given this ha@@ em@@ bell binary , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target management should be tried to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target range from 10 g / d@@ l ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ gen value over 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose to reduce 25 % .

&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ gen increased by at least 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ance over 1,@@ 0@@ ,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting point , the dose of 150 is / kg / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 / kg once a week . &quot;

&quot; patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ taking place of ≥ 4 blood preser@@ ves should be obtained in a dose of 600 m / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the operative procedure . &quot;

&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 m / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operating procedure and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively should be staged at least 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the surgery , as well as 4 days immediately after . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the inj@@ ecting at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis be given over the hose to a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ oton@@ ous cooking solution in order to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medication by means of the circulation . &quot;
patients who are used under the treatment with any Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not be obtained or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;

&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa were combined with the following advantages , esc@@ ales arter@@ ial coron@@ ary disease , cereb@@ ral coron@@ ary disease , cereb@@ ral coron@@ ary disease , cereb@@ ral coron@@ ary heart attack , or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis event . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an em@@ bodi@@ ment PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .

&quot; when the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ant , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index , &quot; ) , and if no other reason of a drug loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tin antibodies determines and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ isation in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of abor@@ tion in patients with a risk for an em@@ bodi@@ ment induc@@ ed PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not adequate .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , in case of maintenance therapy the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target should not be exceeded by the 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target . &quot;
in clinical studies a higher degree of moral risks and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed if Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ese @-@ stimulating active ingredients ( ESA ) have been given a concentration of more than 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits that is attributable to the hub of epo@@ xy if the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ ational concentration on the control of an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions will be increased .
the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ ed rose to approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ dently coron@@ ary heart disease or reservoir in@@ suff@@ ence the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target should not be exceeded by the 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target .
&quot; following these findings , due to the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
for tum@@ our patients with chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ G@@ abe and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin response ( patients that may be trans@@ figured out ) .
if the H@@ B increase is higher than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must minim@@ ise the risk of possible thro@@ har@@ b@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ ator between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patients who should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tro @-@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis if they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ bell pro@@ phyla@@ xis since they have an increased risk of thro@@ har@@ b@@ ular and v@@ ascular disease especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease .
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting treatment of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l , an increased risk of post@@ operative / vas@@ cul@@ ary events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , it was not proven for epo@@ xy that they improve overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received one chemotherapy , if a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target range from 12 - 14 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted . &quot;
will epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa used together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ th@@ osis should be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ o@@ rit .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies at tum@@ ours there are no evidence of an interplay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ary events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thropo@@ id .
independent of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ wer poe@@ tin treatment can occur in surgical patients with cardi@@ ogen@@ ic gr@@ under@@ disease after repeti@@ tive blood sp@@ las@@ hing and v@@ ascular complications .
the GM epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ ined and is identical with the endo@@ genous human@@ oid ar@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of local patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stim@@ ulates the er@@ y@@ thropo@@ esis and not influenced the leu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ese .

survival and tum@@ ours were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ eable studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in total survival between the patients treated with pure human@@ oid ar@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients and the control patients . &quot;
in these studies the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated in patients with an an@@ a@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ic sist@@ ent , statis@@ tically significant higher mortality than in the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ ru@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ar@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients and with controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic bol@@ ic events in tumor patients , treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ar@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic , and a negative effect on the overall survival can not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far this results can be handled on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ wer poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of transferring a tick @-@ glo@@ bin@@ ess under 13 g / d@@ l , as a few patients were included with these characteristics in the tested data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa rules after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy prob@@ es and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um level of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the Ser@@ um@@ ber levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ecting . &quot;
&quot; there is no Kum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um mirror remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gig or 24 hours after the final gift . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk risks , including patients who have recently suffered a s@@ trau@@ mati@@ al hip @-@ break@@ age like during the hin@@ ge ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip delay should be a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by inj@@ tion into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ acet@@ am@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms in the three days after the in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pping pain , pe@@ aches and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may not be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material was taken for Z@@ omet@@ a for evaluating Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip surveys have been examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study summ@@ ed up 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for 50 years , which recently suffered a hip exchange ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta has been tested for a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , bone substance ) in the blood has decreased again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the starting point . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates for patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip delay had 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to risk of kidney failure , reactions to the in@@ fusion station and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta presents recep@@ tions for doctors ready to prescri@@ bes the Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence includes how to apply the medicines , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

&quot; patient inform@@ ational package should be provided and include the following core message : • The packaging reduction in pregnancy and pregnant women • Re@@ duce a reasonable amount of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , the non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • W@@ ann to access medical or easy help . &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent exp@@ elled low @-@ traum@@ atic aber@@ ration . &quot;
to treat the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic aber@@ ration , the administration of in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip la@@ sty ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ payment period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to make sure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent exp@@ elled low @-@ traum@@ atic aber@@ ration , an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 m or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by hub of acet@@ am@@ amo@@ le or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min will not be recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger . &quot;
&quot; children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , as data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because these patients are limited only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hy@@ po@@ kal@@ a@@ emia is treated before the start of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of rapid inser@@ ting the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ a@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to make sure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental handles , no data are available , whether the break of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the ortho@@ graphy . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the incidence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by offering of acet@@ am@@ amo@@ le or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of accus@@ ation , was increased by patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.@@ 3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of anticip@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.8 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted effects have been listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney @-@ disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function that is referred to as the decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( per year prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to the acet@@ one and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with effect of 0.1 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the lab findings , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic values , which were treated below the normal spon@@ ge area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.@@ 3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for spine @-@ fat compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta pointed out an equal effect over three years , which resulted in an increased risk over three years ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral acid , hip and at dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone st@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic spon@@ ge .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients compared to plac@@ ebo an increase in the bearing bone volume and the preservation of the bearing bone architecture .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the output and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting date after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the starting date up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror have not been routine , but the majority of patients received an initial amount of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 m ( 50,000 or in@@ tra @-@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall performance was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .

the Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treatment led over 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.2 % of the total hardness and by 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ bow .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were evaluated 5@@ 08 Men random@@ ized and at 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
&quot; the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; incidence of clinical frac@@ tures amoun@@ ted to 7.5 % at Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.2 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once more annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been referred to a percentage of percentage of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in comparison to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the output . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain efficiency and pain handling compared to the starting value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Res@@ p@@ onder at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be included in an observation phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was compared with 71 the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the last observation period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi @-@ fold 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma @-@ bar took fast on &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ ph@@ onic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ off @-@ times ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ hour 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary phase with a tempor@@ al elimination period of ½ g of 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and ß , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid reset to the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the dosage is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ ec@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished clearing of by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ymers systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at humans is not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed and because it becomes a sh@@ aking or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patients groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ; for 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ; and in the 64 examined patients in the average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it follows that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney disorder until up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; since there are only limited data for heavy kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inside Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , for these populations no statements are possible . &quot;
acute toxicity The highest not let@@ al degra@@ dation amoun@@ ted to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; studies in dogs were single d@@ ants of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ triple of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered for over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic Tox@@ icity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al compatibility of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg was administered in intervals of 2 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in dogs was administered up in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ times of the human therapeutic exposure , based on AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well tolerated . &quot;

&quot; the most common report on studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ se of the long bones , at animals in the growth phase with nearly all doses , a report that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ static impact of the substance . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen made from and@@ rogen , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is made too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ matched , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta acts by norm@@ alizes the bone structure with a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bones .
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , notify your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , ph@@ arm@@ aci@@ sts or the nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines of which they are ashamed of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are worried that you should take enough fluid according to the instructions of your doctor and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dosage is 5 mg once a year which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broke the hip , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta will make two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need a further dose after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta suits your doctor , you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; before finishing the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor t@@ ter@@ min and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;

&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to make sure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ traum@@ atic aber@@ ration , a starting dosage is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 m or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR &quot; &quot; review of the present document is a summary of the European Public Holidays report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which research committee will be assessed as the committee for human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) to proceed to recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as non ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ) is not displayed together with another th@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ( dual therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest compatibility dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ans or ins@@ ulin can be retained with patients with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or the ins@@ ulin is to be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body @-@ owned ins@@ ulin can be improved better and the blood sugar level decreases , thus reducing type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ resin , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured ( gly@@ co@@ ded hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a reduction of the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar @-@ values when applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg have been reduced . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional charge of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ans in a reduction of the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin is examined in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients who participated in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction of the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients that were additionally plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with accounts were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( detection ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic rubber - acid level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the frame of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole usage ) is intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission shared the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited filed an approval for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved , and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and with which Met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart disease ) or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and incre@@ mental the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a disease failure , weight gain or oils , particularly those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a risk of disease , weight gain and oils , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular illness was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver cancer ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver illness can not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increasing are the liver values as soon as possible again to control .
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed , refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , fatigue , appetite , appetite and / or dark@@ er har@@ n , are the liver values . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the patient treatment is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should lead to the management of laboratory parameters from the clinical evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight increase has been detected , which can be stir@@ red up of fat deposits , and in some cases connected with a hydr@@ ation . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ ost@@ um falls under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slight reduction in the middle of the middle of the middle level ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ als and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in to 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , in patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as a double or triple therapy with ins@@ ulin is obtained , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a occurrence or deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ dems with a reduction of visual ac@@ uity . &quot;
it is unclear whether between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ls should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dems if patients should report on disorders of visual ac@@ uity . a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic explanation should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot;
&quot; the reck@@ oning incidence amounts to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who have been treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , which were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who have been treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this entry is treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the examination of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmaceutical industry or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction tas@@ mer are not to be expected . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the met@@ ric sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in Tur@@ g@@ ors and the brake inde@@ xes of the lens , as they can also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ dri@@ es entered the thre@@ e@@ fold the upper limit of the standard area , but more often than in comparison groups among met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was reduced by 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market was rarely reported on heart failure under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the group of compar@@ isons treated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients with compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; in taking the peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days they played no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ proliferation ) activation ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which results in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin sensi@@ tivity of liver and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ er@@ al glu@@ cos@@ ity in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time until the post of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment machines ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were inadequate despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ cal optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c is reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continue to only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been observed . &quot;
in clinical studies over a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on applied an statis@@ tically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the output values .
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks in the examination of type @-@ 2 di@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials in comparison to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly raised LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plas@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statis@@ tically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed during met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced values were observed .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , this can be obtained via an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease in groups random@@ ized , over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations to be achieved at un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to the efficacy of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) or lowers the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ ec@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active striking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was mainly found in the case ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ atory period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active met@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ alli@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy prob@@ es , whereby the r@@ ates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ k@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed according to repeti@@ tive administration of plastic surgery with hem@@ modi@@ ty , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible heart hyper@@ trop@@ y . &quot;
this is due to that in treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which is dimin@@ ished in the creation of hyper@@ ins@@ ulators and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ ric sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed at the R@@ atte elevated inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asi@@ an ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epith@@ eli@@ um epith@@ eli@@ um .
in an animal model of the familiar poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) led the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons to an increased frequency of collagen .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reck@@ oning incidence amounts to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who have been treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , which were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who have been treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were examined .
in clinical studies over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on applied an statis@@ tically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , this can be obtained via a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was l@@ acked with regard to its primary final point , a combination of the overall performance , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , stroke and Rev@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of leg arter@@ ies , set the results close that the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who received with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , showed itself an increased incidence of bone br@@ aces in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , which were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who have been treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ o reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , this can be obtained via an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; if the ur@@ inary bar is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased once a day of 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , still tox@@ ins can occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients are taking at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for preventing tox@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients took part , the effectiveness of three in@@ dem@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared with the plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ drug ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study there were two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary bars in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l lay .
&quot; in the first study had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who participated in a dose of once daily 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who took once daily with a ur@@ inary bladder in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , this was at 22 % ( 60 from 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ol and none of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart disease in the pre@@ history , there may also be a higher risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary effect of the primary issue was in every study of the proportion of patients in which the last three months were determined by certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ bags &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a Ser@@ um@@ kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ worth at the course of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed under 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) under 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study demonstrated in view of the long @-@ term reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ bags under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) the statis@@ tically significant superi@@ ority both for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of the servo drives on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit of week 2 and permanently maintain over the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ value &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary final point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney failure . the AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney failure ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary effect of this issue is 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) ; 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in proportions of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney disorders ) .
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ re@@ concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( AC@@ eline ) and F@@ act study ( Bas@@ eline ) had an ser@@ um @-@ acid @-@ concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected within two years showed that the lasting reduction of servo drives on &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) has taken a decrease in the incidence of tox@@ ins , so that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment required ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the toxicity size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gyp@@ sum up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.5 % ) and also in patients who received the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C that is bigger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after intake simpler or multi @-@ pler cans of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.5 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in percentage of Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid @-@ concentration was observed if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady distribution volumes ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plasma connection from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant on the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause . there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or intake of other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin in@@ complem@@ entary ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the freight , the patient must go down until after the first food intake of the day , which shall take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D sp@@ ans .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors have been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , smaller ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data in front of that which in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is exactly the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as abdom@@ en , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , bl@@ aming , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( infl@@ amed stomach ) as well as su@@ cking up . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ wa@@ iger over@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components of the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to diseases of the food tube , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand up or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or penetration of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following critics are precisely to be followed to reduce the risk for op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up after the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day that is to take early 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the top Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ al@@ tra@@ kt except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty , just under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Eastern sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ os , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ tions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a disease statement ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out when treating symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , pain in the gor@@ ges or retro@@ viral pain , or reproduce the medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of heavy op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , continues . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage assignments will be given to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large , clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk has been observed , were rarely ( according to market introduction ) stomach and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card of the j@@ aw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ist ime mostly intraven@@ ously controlled Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the deri@@ ving of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a ortho@@ surgical procedure , reducing the risk of a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card of the pine . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet into the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but taking advantage of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
&quot; other disorders that imp@@ air the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) , should be treated prior to the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ action studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or pregnant women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no reference to directly compensation effects in terms of pregnancy that can detect embryonic / o@@ ily or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports originate from cancer patients , but was also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
nevertheless they came from Ser@@ um @-@ calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate phosph@@ ate up to &lt; 2.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the An@@ sti@@ ege of the BM@@ D of spine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ o controlled studies , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg once daily either via 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily routine of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new spine in order to 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.0 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption based on a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before recording of a standardized bed .
the bio@@ availability took accordingly at around 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken at one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
in healthy pro@@ aches the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times per day over five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the average of 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 Distribution Studies on rats have yiel@@ ded that Al@@ end@@ ronic is temporarily distributed to intraven@@ ous G@@ uns by 1 mg / kg temporarily , but then quickly divided into the bones or re@@ tired with the urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous Gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were found around 50 % of radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the thread .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance was not only 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not re@@ tired in rats , not via the aci@@ dic or bas@@ tic transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not believed that when people affected the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; characteristics in patients and clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , which is not ex@@ pi@@ red in the bones , quickly beyond the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data are available , nevertheless , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in animal try to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney failure , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ tation was pushed after a treatment duration of one year ( by example examined how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , recent studies carried out for 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investigated as advance as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is included in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with et@@ id@@ le hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied for advance . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the same at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , should this drug treat or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ itter or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ o soup . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should only be made under the tigh@@ ter control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant medicine . ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in a result of an altern@@ ation to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic treatment and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systematic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility . ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ king should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
&quot; on day 4 the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a talent level , comparable to both wor@@ dings , both at kidney and le@@ aded patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ant@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of pharmaceuticals can be initiated the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
&quot; the duration of the application to supp@@ ression of tran@@ spl@@ itter must be sustained ; consequently , the immune soup must not be sustained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney failure / pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily routine in the morning .
additional dosage adjustment can be required later because the phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily routine in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a tran@@ spl@@ itter of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ f , so this switching in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose . &quot;
Ni@@ er@@ - and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily must start the treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ itter .
&quot; coron@@ ary tran@@ spl@@ ant in adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , is a oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ itter recipient ob@@ serves not a clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ ties and col@@ on transplan@@ ts patients in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day to apply . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function igni@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no influence on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , is recommended a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um @-@ in @-@ bar , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ward and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) . &quot;
switching of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in at Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the switching of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the talent level in full blood . the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in individual case under tut@@ oring of full @-@ bloo@@ ded Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ king controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the treatment therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in the simultaneous use of substances , which could be controlled by the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us inhibit@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
&quot; the statements in clinical studies allow that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the talent level in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml does not exceed . &quot;
in clinical practice the talent level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the very first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and at risk - and hearty patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , usually blood con@@ centric presses were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious unwanted events , including tran@@ spl@@ itter or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should only be made under the tigh@@ ter control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant medicine . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , are still no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ itter for adult heart transplan@@ ts and tran@@ spl@@ itter we have no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of reproductive material ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) is included , or other plant @-@ funds for treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ h concentrations in the blood occur , because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in some uncommon cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f it was designated as a cardi@@ omy@@ opath@@ y , or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ y , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infection , fluid @-@ over and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pr@@ es such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual disorders should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f carbide capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is available in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase lack or glu@@ cose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ ay special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as a inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or decrease . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine blood levels can change , monitor the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations in accordance with ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a highly pronounced interaction was made with antim@@ y@@ cot@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ os@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic , er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies ensure that the increase in blood levels mainly depends on the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the im@@ itation of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal multip@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute degra@@ dation , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or decrease in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , metabolism means metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us desc@@ end the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormone exposure , is particularly careful about decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time period .
the results of a limited number of investigations on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
&quot; at uter@@ o exposure , a surveillance of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the in@@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the path@@ ological disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
&quot; following are shown the side effects after their incidence in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( = 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is treated with patients who are treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us the sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , mys@@ tical ) frequently increased . &quot;
cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ ro@@ path@@ ia and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive leu@@ ko@@ er@@ ie ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ vering disease and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high attachment of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma map@@ rot@@ one can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the effect mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level may be convey@@ ed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its binding to an cy@@ tos@@ ine protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enri@@ ching the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ation of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions due to the T @-@ cell and therefore prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us suppres@@ sed the activation of T @-@ cells and the proliferation of B cells , also the formation of l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ins ( such as Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the Inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 recept@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ates is used for treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , inn@@ ate blood pressure @-@ disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application are directed thereafter if Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or for the prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack which causes blood@@ stream problems such as blood cells in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa will not be extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) which allows them to be the formation of the human smell factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ates is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , however , is produced differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human@@ oid or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate Hä@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug is investigated with the prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical interventions . &quot;
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was rated in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ iso@@ those with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies towards factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advance may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human smell factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or any of the other components . &quot;
in March 2004 the European Commission shared the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG acquired an approval for the transport of Adv@@ antage in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment are determined according to the sever@@ ity wheel of the factor VIII deficiency . according to the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .
&quot; in the following hem@@ mor@@ p@@ hic events , the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period is not supposed to sink into the specified plasma @-@ bar ( in % of the standard or in b / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are fixed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the control of the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections will be a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma @-@ bar . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction by factor VIII to reach various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different sem@@ it@@ ones .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for a long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 m of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plastic activities are not achieved or when the blood is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to im@@ itate an in@@ em@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic action must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
the appointment speed is to be directed after loading the patient with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ary activity of factor VIII led Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by modi@@ fi@@ able Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ wan .
&quot; the risk of developing infected by inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the largest 20 exposure days on the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 countries , and am@@ nest@@ y @-@ known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ic development was observed , after converting from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re @-@ yiel@@ ding inhibit@@ ors ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare rise of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding is no experience . &quot;
&quot; with the biggest number of patients rising A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who all have previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial use of the data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be valued as positive , but considering that the security profile must be monitored closely for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is required on the basis of the Security profile of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation has to apply for a further reduction in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited shared the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ance ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application for approval for the In@@ struction of Adv@@ enti@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the wheat parts ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and bases ) of it . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of virus that has changed gene@@ tically , that it can be a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has changed so that there can be no copies of yourself and thus trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have j@@ umped directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is caused by no defects in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study with a patient before , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ sist@@ ence , into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP , the answers of the company had been tested on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of initial entries , the CH@@ MP provides a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , not adequately proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of drug , in the body , the type of administration and security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the Company did not take note of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients has currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed active substances &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective components are instantly released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hypo@@ cris@@ p ) by a allergy to p@@ ollen caused by nas@@ al infections of the nose @-@ skin ( hidden nose ) .
&quot; for adults and youths from 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ri@@ pen@@ cils nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be dimin@@ ished on the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective treatment were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ y@@ u@@ pf@@ n@@ ymp@@ h symptoms that were reported by the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale , as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all ha@@ y@@ u@@ pf@@ n@@ ymp@@ h symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients received the aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze , compared with 35@@ ,@@ 9 % compared to the patient , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , the patients showed under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , showed a relief of symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac ) , mou@@ th@@ fulness , psych@@ otrop@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( cur@@ rants ) , swelling , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ) , ins@@ ulating disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ cs drugs or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ om@@ dd@@ augh@@ ter ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease or vessel diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ me ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ ical stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared by the Company SP Europe appro@@ ve the authorisation of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without breaking down , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data on the in@@ vari@@ ability and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of use at 10 days because in long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time .
&quot; after decrease the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also con@@ fer@@ ed in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amer@@ al oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ers , Per@@ go@@ ose , Cab@@ erg@@ y@@ amin , Er@@ ror or nas@@ al , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of these com@@ bin@@ ational therapy were not tested for this patient and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or rein@@ forcement of head@@ ache ) must be deduc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in treating the following patients groups are advised to caution : • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin actions or reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma @-@ cent@@ ation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing , no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and those with plac@@ ebo aged patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzy@@ me of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ me was not yet identified , so interactions with other medicines may not be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate is still a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ glut@@ y@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ vari@@ ability of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , does not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
since reproduction of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ pe properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a ben@@ ch@@ ment , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ co@@ ding , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor versions ) with potential let@@ tu@@ als . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , frigh@@ tened mi@@ stress , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , t@@ ace@@ ous , nau@@ sea , Tinnitus , arom@@ a@@ ie , visual impair@@ ment and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , P@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid , and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ net , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the shirts of the release of pro@@ voc@@ ative cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mastering cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and also the im@@ itation of expression of the adhesive molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dosage study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flu@@ e , including the strengthening subjective b@@ lows or the tasks connected to the fly . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day there was no increased frequency of hassle in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ ent effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ton@@ ic or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by means of the total level for the symptom ( except nas@@ al loop ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the ab@@ tail effects , determined by the nose @-@ skin @-@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
in the context of a single dosage study on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is a des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma .
&quot; after the per@@ oral application from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy pro@@ aches over 14 days the flow of flow of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ functional study , which has been carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ aches , has been determined that four commission gangs des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly affected . &quot;

&quot; based on conventional studies for safety , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity and reproduction of reproduction , the prec@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ows can be recognized in no special dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ ato@@ genic .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of qu@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and the efficiency of the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;

there are limited experience from clinical trials in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ acting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease progression , and can be resum@@ ed after the end of the symptoms and at their re @-@ occur . &quot;
&quot; in the Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week , and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ gen period . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study was not reinforced by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases , it can come to a impair@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judgments , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently solved side effects , which was reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo , were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ aches , these occurred at 5.5 % of the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated with 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a multi @-@ professional dose which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were not clin@@ ically relevant effects .
&quot; this includes both the shirts of the release of pro@@ voc@@ ative cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mastering cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of expression of the adhesive molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multi @-@ p@@ ants , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days was administered , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) has been administered for over ten days , was not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flu@@ e , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective symptoms or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms , as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ acting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .

the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was also examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria as the underlying path@@ physiological procedures in the different forms are similar and chronic patients may be simpler to be pro@@ spec@@ tively .
&quot; since the hi@@ st@@ am@@ in@@ for@@ f@@ uneral is a hur@@ ried factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases , is expected that Des@@ qu@@ at@@ ad@@ in except in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic judgments towards an improvement of the symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic judgments , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first c@@ low@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti @-@ stam@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic judgments , the minority of patients who were not re@@ acted upon Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ch for more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and guard considerably , as measured by a 4 @-@ points scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical research study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved at 4 % of patients with a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant g@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ me of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ me was not yet identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;

the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are intended to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years of metabo@@ li@@ ze C@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and learn a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which have limited metabo@@ li@@ ze , is identical to the children that norm@@ alities normal . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been established in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study was not reinforced by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the overall effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judgments , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ functional study conducted in adults and young people , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;

&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic judgments and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , the effective data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be reduced to children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multi @-@ subject adults in adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg once daily was applied for 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) officially concluded that the company takes its application to appro@@ ving A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A @-@ virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause prior to a tribe of the flu @-@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a gri@@ pping pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out , when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ er appears , which can easily spread from man to human because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; physical @-@ virus &quot; &quot; and constitutes antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system will be able to form fast antibodies in contact with a grip virus of this pedi@@ gree . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ alien@@ ation ) separated and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
this enables the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for preventive vaccines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that have been infected with the human@@ istic immune @-@ virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined what anti @-@ viral medicines has previously taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has judged that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at body weight . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV level in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; to cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system and thereby delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with proteins . &quot;
&quot; this compared with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , which had formerly proteins in eas@@ ants , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ veri@@ fi@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ eas@@ ed previously , we had more patients with Vir@@ us@@ last less than 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children reduced A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last , but with children , however , were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , only very few on the treatment languages . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which were treated earlier with protein previously , lowered the viral medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in patients who took their former prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and sh@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rants ( an herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines that are produced just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , A@@ gener@@ ase is taking the risk of Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ ek@@ card ( ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immune activation of syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of an infection , which are caused by the recovered immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that the benefits of A@@ v@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat patients treated treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ed HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously had no protein previously . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the approval of scientific reasons are limited only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Limited filed an approval for the transport of A@@ v@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ed ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting are administered along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the one is 14 % less than from Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis does not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) must be applied higher doses to axi@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmaceutical , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on in@@ vari@@ ability and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ckets 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements which contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk minim@@ izing plas@@ mak@@ es@@ centr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase is not preventing the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy treatment have an increased risk of severe liver illness with potentially fatal course .
for the event of simultaneous treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the specialized information of this medicine .
patients with advanced liver function including chronic hep@@ atitis are an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ o@@ ids , which is not recommended over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ depen@@ ded and reg@@ ression of the auxiliary @-@ line function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the di@@ version of the H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ su@@ atin depends heavily on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ v@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or vital @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , are available methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma &apos;s bars ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxicity according to the high prop@@ yl engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ ance of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion , this formulation is contra@@ sted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ eas@@ eg@@ mer , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ ure of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other disorders , whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B. Higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ed reports , are reports of an increase of blood , including spontaneous , hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ oms . &quot;
in the time the introduction of anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ckets 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be associated with medicinal products whose active ingredients are mainly related to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma bar with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ fi@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C is caused by am@@ il@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to offset the lower plasma bar through a dosage increase of other prot@@ o @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , have been observed very often unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ herb ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ is@@ k@@ herb ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already engaged in cur@@ ses , the Am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror is and , if possible to check the virus load and de@@ activate the cur@@ ler . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ d below ) .
&quot; increased 5@@ 08 % , for C@@ max against 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered . &quot;
in clinical trials doses of 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % degra@@ dation if Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is however a tigh@@ tening monitoring recommended , as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but due to the imagin@@ ative component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
this is why the hub of E@@ f@@ avi@@ sta in combination with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ d in combination with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ eas@@ ed and existing limited data can be presum@@ ed that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly lowers the ser@@ vi@@ cal of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable when Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bar . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of combination of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gri@@ pe of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plastic de@@ centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin effects .
&quot; when it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be administered along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma @-@ bar of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ y@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ y@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions , which are linked to these medicines , when they are used in combination with A@@ v@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come on Res@@ or@@ p@@ tions@@ . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ volcan@@ ic acid , which are known as an enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ ers , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of plasma &apos;s bars . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium concentrations such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased from 10 by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plastic de@@ centr@@ ation , and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , visual impair@@ ments and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at pro@@ aches were significantly increased while the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % . ( 90 % -@@ interval interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous offering of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected in the increase of plasma @-@ bar for simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma cutting of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines is not recommended . &quot;
it will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations as well as stabili@@ zation of the mirror since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time limit of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic gases may not be applied along with oral bi@@ ased Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ent@@ alem mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ent@@ alem mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ants indicate a possible increase in plasma @-@ bar of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered along with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust how the Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted if Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
in con@@ current goods of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ hydr@@ ated or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ har@@ b@@ inger effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predicted , therefore , alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in con@@ current goods by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful absorption of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .

&quot; a reproduction study on masculine , which was administered by the ni@@ b in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed during the breast@@ feeding period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the afternoon . &quot;
the further development of descendants including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the in@@ vari@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined by adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment @-@ effects associated side effects were slightly to moderate , came up early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the path@@ ological disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the aforementioned side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ eas@@ ants did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;

in the time the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase were observed twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and lab alter@@ ations , which were used in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently appeared . &quot;

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic infl@@ atable cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ er@@ al blood @-@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % O@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ fitting non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r bir@@ d@@ inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / G , I@@ 4@@ V , and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ u@@ ster can make changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations to the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; at the phenomen@@ al @-@ based analysis clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems may be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ e data to estimate the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ e Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test . &quot;
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ y@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain clo@@ ves against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r that remains sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resist@@ ence between Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r resistance , either on your own or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spective patients , where a Fos@@ am@@ y@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulates ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ed anti @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
the early breakdown of a ver@@ itable therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ sti@@ ckers ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , predominantly with a lower Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ thre@@ es@@ thre@@ es@@ thre@@ es@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ embarrass@@ ment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in regard to the time @-@ to @-@ judicial change from the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks fixed at a non @-@ under@@ rate shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ ten copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , from which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was tested for inser@@ ting and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI @-@ treated patients had previously been at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the included patients had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) opposite the output . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during therapy with PI pre @-@ treated children , who are considered to be expected to be considered &quot; un@@ covered &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; increased 5@@ 08 % , for C@@ max is lowered by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % acceptance of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of the conversion . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and makes it possible to close a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in plasma , with the amount of irregular ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ free@@ zing Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the metering inter@@ fer@@ v@@ alls within the Ste@@ ady State power supply depends on the area of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s . &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines that indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution administered , if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the hub of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposition as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r plasma @-@ plasma which are comparable to healthy prob@@ es after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for rab@@ bits with am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats occurred at doses at doses of the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings in clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ iz@@ ations tests , the bacterial re@@ reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m tests , micro@@ por@@ ters and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ atic tests , was Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ing nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ . &quot;
this liver toxic can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , in clinical studies no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from a age of 4 days , shown both in the inspection as well as those treated with am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; during a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage , but were observed , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton were observed , which refer to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with watch@@ ful or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines , which can cause serious or vital @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , are available methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be deduc@@ ted for duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; a higher risk of Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ fi@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C is caused by am@@ il@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
&quot; increased 5@@ 08 % , for C@@ max against 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is however a tigh@@ tening monitoring recommended , as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ d in combination with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of combination of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; when it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be administered along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium concentrations such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Di@@ o@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ o@@ az@@ em , Comp@@ ol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased through am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r , causing the activity and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at pro@@ aches were significantly increased while the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % . ( 90 % -@@ interval interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
in con@@ current goods of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ hydr@@ ated or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ har@@ b@@ inger effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful absorption of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study on masculine , which was administered by the ni@@ b in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed during the breast@@ feeding period a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight . &quot;
the in@@ vari@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined by adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary to initiate the necessary support measures . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic infl@@ atable cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ er@@ al hem@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % O@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ed anti @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
&quot; based on these data should be considered in therapy with PI pre @-@ treated children , who are considered to be expected to be considered &quot; un@@ covered &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ free@@ zing Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the metering inter@@ fer@@ v@@ alls in the Ste@@ ady State power supply depends on the area of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .. &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines that indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution administered , if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ est@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for rab@@ bits with am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats occurred at doses at doses of the 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ul@@ ae aden@@ omes and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings in clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ iz@@ ations tests , the bacterial re@@ reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te tests , micro@@ por@@ ters and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ atic tests , am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ing nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ . &quot;
&quot; studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from a age of 4 days , shown both in the inspection as well as those treated with am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results can be concluded that in juven@@ iles , the meteor@@ ological passages are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ ed ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; e@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was neither received with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the one is 14 % less than from Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis does not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to the one ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dosage recommendations for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ y@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ ance , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is to take care of inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may result in a compres@@ sive im@@ itation of the met@@ alli@@ zation of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase is not preventing the risk of suffering from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines , which can cause serious or liv@@ able side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , are available methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be deduc@@ ted for duration when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; a higher risk of Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ed reports , are reports of an increase of blood , including spontaneous , hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ oms . &quot;

&quot; the applic@@ ability and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treatment to be treated three times per week . • In case of small Bas@@ al@@ cell disease , the cream par@@ don@@ t has been applied for six weeks five times weekly with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; the cream is in front of sleep @-@ th@@ inner on the affected skin areas , so that they remain sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete de@@ parts of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara has also been treated to 7@@ 24 patients with small Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma in which patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete abor@@ tion of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies at a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate amoun@@ ted from 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ch ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ op@@ tic ker@@ at@@ ants ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic adult , if the size or the number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy , and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before getting up and 6 to 10 hours long on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ me is so long to continue until all of the visible antenn@@ as in the genital or Peri@@ an@@ al@@ zone have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period . &quot;
a break in the above treatment process should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammation actions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when in the treatment area an infection is observed .
&quot; when follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treatment of lesi@@ ons was only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient carry the cream , once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ me is applied in a thin layer , and in the puri@@ fied , inf@@ lic@@ ed with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients there should be a de@@ compression between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their autoimmune illness . &quot;
the risk associated with these patients should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ @-@ versus or GRA@@ FT @-@ versus &apos;s reaction .
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ en@@ could have been carried out , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with one to circum@@ c@@ ision &apos;s leading stri@@ pe were observed . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , a higher risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under proper use of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation , which made a treatment required and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required a emergency cath@@ eter and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; in connection to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an app@@ li@@ zed means for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in gen@@ ital@@ - and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ field , no clinical experience are now available . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest to an increased rate of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient in relation to the elimination of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts however a lower effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin actions are common but the intensity of these reactions occur in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin transactions , a treatment period can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates are available for more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered with super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al bas@@ ins other suitable therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experience prior to , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that with large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip field within the lip@@ stick . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants of anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent Ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin actions occur frequently but these reactions normally take over the course of therapy to intensity or go back after deri@@ ving the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams .
&quot; if local skin actions are causing great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - lesi@@ ons reported a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the imm@@ or@@ ative properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ me should be used with caution in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not go directly or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embryo , or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;

the most frequently dealt with and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams in connection related side effects in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions on the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
among the most frequently reported and considered probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection related side effects include complaints on the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream @-@ treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ me related to the side @-@ effect were in these studies a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; the side effects , which were specified by 252 in plac@@ ebo controlled clinical trials of the Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to testing schedule presented by clinical signs , it shows in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ controlled treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams often to local skin transactions including Er@@ ror ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ aps ( 14 % ) and Ö@@ L@@ ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to test plan presented by clinical signs indicate that it was very common in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creams ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ oms ( 13 % ) , and to severe chim@@ ation and dis@@ armament ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the study of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was detected with a frequency of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment office or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the weekly recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , might cause nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gi@@ as and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically hard@@ est side @-@ effect , which entered after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ological examination the increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ c@@ ine were detected .
&quot; in 3 permissible @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , the effectiveness in relation to a complete payout division of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts could be clearly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment for 16 weeks . &quot;
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy patients healed the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts completely off ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo patients ( 95 % CI ) :

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ st@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ an@@ I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase lack ) used to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that do not stand with brain or nerves in connection ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( Gl@@ y@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kane , g@@ ags ) cannot be eliminated and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and avoid them . &quot;
&quot; the following not neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , dimin@@ ished lung @-@ volume , cardi@@ ac and de@@ gener@@ als . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with res@@ ili@@ ence equipment , and patients may also need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating its effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under five years of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine around about 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed out at the end of the study a normal great liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , pain @-@ pain , pain , pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ esteem , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may possibly be heavily over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ v@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information each year , which may not be announced , and this summary will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission shared the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. appro@@ ve the authorisation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA using Ch@@ o @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with a secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ an@@ I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries out this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients there is no dosage schedule .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ rage has not been determined and for these patients there is no dosage schedule .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related to the side @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should also be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ traction facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ v@@ id@@ ase are usually formed within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction need to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically heigh@@ tened risk reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti @-@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ amo@@ le / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti @-@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ amo@@ le / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is available . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 will be used ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and acet@@ am@@ using and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate in which the pre @-@ completed reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is established .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embryonic / o@@ ily development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is raised to newborn babies which were expon@@ entially over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , recommended while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not recommended . &quot;
side effects in clinical trials were predominantly referred to as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years of treatment ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that have been observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and their extender for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ condi@@ ter participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe responses to , including Bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , respiratory and facial hair ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s unwanted effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were conducted during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly he@@ at@@ ering form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the start of treatment , with a serious delay in the age of 5 years ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were conducted in 13 / 45 patients with 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients who have never came to Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with inf@@ alli@@ on to lower anti@@ body mirror , a robust decrease of the G@@ AG Spi@@ der in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ em@@ bodi@@ ment , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ alized until low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed not to be linked to the incidence of unwanted effects , even if the occurrence of unwanted effects typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies . &quot;
the basis for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the disease spectrum was reported , the majority of patients were by the middle phen@@ otyp@@ e and only one patient reported the serious phen@@ otyp@@ e . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary final points for the effectiveness were the percentage of expected FE@@ V and the absolute path @-@ distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were subsequently en@@ rolled for an open @-@ label extension study where it received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients over the plac@@ ebo group , an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the en@@ vi@@ ability that is shown in the following table . &quot;
in the open extension study an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the estimated percentage of percentage is not clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased significantly proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly treatment achieved 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear cut down of the G@@ AG mirror at the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established that remained constant for the student . &quot;
&quot; with regard to hetero@@ geneous disease cases between patients who summari@@ zes using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes were summar@@ ised for five realities ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration at 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration at 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy clas@@ p form and 4 with the middle session form ) .
&quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror at the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in multiple patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) , following the Z @-@ score for these age group , the younger patients with the heavy trial form will be a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe in@@ flow form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ doses were conducted on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute drive . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients , the difficulties with weekly In@@ fu@@ sions , a representative alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will evaluate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medication is updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety , toxicity , toxicity and reproduction , toxicity and reproduction , the prec@@ clinical data do not recognize special dangers for human beings . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who has not been removed any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , if the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic color@@ ectal cancer , which does not attack the epith@@ eli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who were previously not treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as a single therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take part during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) take and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should appear before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ c@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ as@@ tics &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to bend hydr@@ o @-@ lack gel ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be cured , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ down , thus the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide . &quot;
the transformation of Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication by means of a longer activity in cancer cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients in the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , which had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ individual lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared with a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , namely in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;

&quot; in patients who previously had received some chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.4 months on doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients , in which cancer does not attack the epith@@ eli@@ al cells , in case of administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparison medicine . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission shared the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. has a approval for the In@@ lim@@ ta of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each plate @-@ bottle must be re@@ ared with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % iger Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA is available in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic color@@ ectal cancer , except in excess of the epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in excess of the epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of Pem@@ at@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ individual bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy is the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions , a day before and on the day of Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed gases and the day after the treatment are given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ id . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy wall , as well as for another 21 days after the last Pem@@ at@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to obtain an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third respon@@ sive cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be produced before each gift a complete blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic stor@@ yt@@ elling . &quot;
al@@ kal@@ ine gases ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage examination must take place in Ber@@ ück@@ ing the N@@ adi@@ rs or the maximum non @-@ ugly toxicity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after relaxation , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Market C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood circulation .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ ugly toxicity level 3 ( except neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient care the value before treatment . &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ re@@ duc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ugly toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 ne@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ - ren or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 an increased risk of exposure .
the ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary to assume that recommended for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - bor@@ der@@ ings and / or tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase value of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic color@@ ectal cancer ) are not particularly examined in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to Kno@@ - chen@@ market soup and Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ - number reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutrality of the number , th@@ ru@@ symbols and maximum non @-@ ugly toxicity , as they have been observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ curing physi@@ ology such as neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutr@@ ro@@ g@@ ie was taken care when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients must be instruc@@ ted with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lak@@ tic measure to reduce treatment of toxicity toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ cy@@ ber@@ acid ( &gt; 1.@@ 3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients intended for treatment with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required , intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who occurred these events , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ collection in the trans@@ cellular area , a dra@@ in@@ age of sei@@ zing before the Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed treatment should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ g , and cerem@@ onial events were reported in clinical trials with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally reported if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ perate living substances ( except yel@@ lowing @-@ fever , this vaccine is contra@@ ven@@ ed ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible skull is made by Pem@@ at@@ re@@ forming , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn and get advice on the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high cans non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ stero@@ idal acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,@@ 3 g daily ) to a reduced Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ ate acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with Pem@@ et@@ re@@ ties be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ano@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pem@@ at@@ re@@ - fixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the Ger@@ inn@@ ation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplastics requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of Pem@@ et@@ re@@ fr@@ xed in pregnant women , but as in case of an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ no@@ unc@@ ement , are expected in an application in pregnancy serious birth defects . &quot;
Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful absorption of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; because the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible impair@@ ment of reproductive capacity is made , men should be pointed out prior to the beginning of the treatment , advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Pem@@ at@@ re@@ xed passes into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects when distill@@ ed inf@@ ant can not be excluded . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was made in the population of all patients who received a test medication in the treatment of treatment ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statis@@ tically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ing Ple@@ j@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om has been shown in the application of the Lun@@ - gen@@ dered symptom@@ sk@@ ala in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a- arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment plants are characterized by an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a distor@@ tion of the lung function in the course of the period in the chec@@ ker .

&quot; in the study with All@@ i , patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss . &quot;

the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when alli made with a fat @-@ sufficient meal or obes@@ e diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with an improved met@@ ric control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli , as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional pregnant women , in order to bend that in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of or@@ ical contrac@@ eption . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ ate , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) can be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with Or@@ list@@ ate in clinical studies until 4 full years , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the standard area . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prevention to make an adequate vitamin . ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a Ein@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , was observed in a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time , Or@@ list@@ ate was observed , a slight withdrawal of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ o@@ centric . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effect on pregnancy , embryonic / o@@ ily development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
&quot; the prevalence are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of detected side effects , which have been established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ ate , is not known as these events are voluntary given by a population of un@@ certain magnitude . &quot;
what is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli can lead to def@@ aults in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single copies of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ ate and multi @-@ subject lengths of up to 400 mg three times were administered for over a period of 15 days at norm@@ al@@ ted and overweight pro@@ aches without any significant clinical trials .
&quot; with the majority of reported cases of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side @-@ side effects or similar side effects were reported in the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on man and animal , can be caused by a fast re @-@ formation of system@@ ic effects which can be attributed to the im@@ pass@@ able properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine through the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and Pan@@ cre@@ atic lip .
&quot; clinical trials was derived that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ ate was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ eable studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 will occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ ate which was taken three times a daily in combination with a hypo@@ cr@@ ative , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight opposite the output ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss entered in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.7 % ( output value 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ concentrations of not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeutic dos@@ ages , not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed Or@@ list@@ ate in plasma is only spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a g@@ rief . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chemotherapy and vom@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be used by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ as@@ tics ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group does not lie enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the compound of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ies were received , which are strong or moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ ger@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; at Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , in which 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ ger@@ ron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with the Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 shared the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting at strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting that induc@@ es through a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding one prior to chemotherapy Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can prolong the col@@ d@@ mp@@ n@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y shelter or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T @-@ interval with medicines that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T @-@ interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; apart from chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should neither be used to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ clinical trials inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not inhi@@ bited the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration or@@ ical Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds in a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; in one on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis has been shown that the simultaneous G@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tors , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied at pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity , complaints , complaints and pains ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest doses showed similar prevalence of unwanted events such as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for al@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies were received a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with approximately 50 mg / m2 Do@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ os intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double flas@@ hing study , altogether 667 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received , which were given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for inde@@ xing chemotherapy induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the investigation of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ PCC and pol@@ pol@@ arization involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular degeneration and re@@ pol@@ ishing the duration of the potential potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted by 221 healthy pro@@ long@@ standing study was assessing the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ V. , of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 , and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe follows an initial decrease of the plastic de@@ centr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ alen half @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic de@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrations time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range from 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ / kg with healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average middle ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma cutting at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , that once upon a daily intraven@@ ous Gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ recur@@ ring administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ max after the delivery of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
about 40 % of the kidneys are eliminated and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes me C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the met@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous daily dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster injection , the overall body weight is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver functioning , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ atory period and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is thereby not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient about the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 From the clinical trials adopted evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ c@@ annon channels and can extend at vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ partments and Re@@ pol@@ arization and the shareholder period can extend .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dosage had been given in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ men ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ uit@@ ary ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses and since Alo@@ xi is destined for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for the authorisation is to bring the European Commission on plans for the transport to be approved in the context of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report in which the approval of the approval of hep@@ atitis C is recommended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C in the treatment of hep@@ atitis C in the treatment of hep@@ atitis C . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon of a biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should resem@@ ble an effective component with the same therapeutic element , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; Reference Pharmac@@ euticals &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( one through a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scope of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage indicates , moreover , the values of the liver enzymes can be increased in the blood @-@ standard ( AL@@ T ) in the blood @-@ standard . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon data presented the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , active , safety and effectiveness in hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference procedure of 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study was measured , how many patients were reported after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : what were the greatest concerns that have made the CH@@ MP recommendation to fail the approval for the inflation ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug use are not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which said to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon flame retard@@ ant , the disease is back on more patients than with the reference procedure ; moreover Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was used in the study to investigate the question , to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins , against the medicine ) , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ vers ( r@@ iss@@ - or car@@ vings ) , sh@@ utter and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections , the veri@@ fi@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against this kind of infections may not work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks for two or three days , the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial reef ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was sealed in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo said to the treatment .
&quot; in treating infected bon@@ net , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ ex@@ in similar response times : if the results of both studies were gathered together in bon@@ net , some 90 % of the patients were examined for the treatment of both groups . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ er@@ ated hollow spaces in the body tissue ) or by infections , which were rep@@ ell@@ ent or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effectively enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term skin infections towards the risks predomin@@ ate : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ fied small in@@ firm@@ ations , sk@@ ul@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients in which shows no improvement within two or three days and should be considered once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken down , the Sal@@ be is carefully ab@@ stain@@ ed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary and infected open wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is caused by patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , insufficient . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs . &quot;
the impact of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plastic de@@ centr@@ ations , which were achieved by humans to topical use on shi@@ el@@ ded skin or infected with infected wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant shirt in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous cleaning of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ro@@ b ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on shi@@ el@@ ted skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not required for patients if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ toxicity according to oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the nim@@ ble / post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the stit@@ ches continued / ended or ended with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is possible between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the date of arrival , which count about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; activity Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial cells by interaction with a particular bond position of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting substances .
data point out that the attachment of the Bosnian Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P bonds and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ act@@ as@@ ez@@ Centre is located .
&quot; by binding at this bond , Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P bonds and avoid normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al under@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ency of the resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some inf@@ ectivity forms should appear , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , compared to S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treat p.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was taken 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily among oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and scre@@ ened skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary wounds , single plasma @-@ wars were won . &quot;
the sampling record took place at the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours following the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 has been shi@@ el@@ ated skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirt . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism Der in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human@@ ly liver microphone was pri@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for oral toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; the holder of permission must ensure that a pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system has to ensure that a pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system is present in the module 1,@@ 8.1 from the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product market is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation is required to perform detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical companies , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and in the module 1.@@ 8.2 of application application , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) with children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not im@@ min@@ ed against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used in the frame of one out of two doses of the vaccine schedule whereby an protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can be carried out at the end of two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose for hep@@ atitis A or B is desired can Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis A@@ - or a B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ inations work by bringing the immune system ( the natural immune defence of the body ) as it can turn against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the frame of one out of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective anti@@ body concentration .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective anti@@ body concentrations against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a s@@ bs and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain , pain , redness , ten@@ acity ( fatigue ) as well as stim@@ ul@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used to treat patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) to be applied .
August 2002 the European Commission shared the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als . a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire region
&quot; the standardization plan for the pri@@ est@@ ul@@ arization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination of combin@@ ant . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atic anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed up whether immun@@ os@@ upp@@ oses competent persons , which are addressed to a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vaccine as they do not have a refres@@ hed antibodies as protection because it may not be protected by the immun@@ o@@ ologic memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the com@@ bin@@ ational material , the 360 ELISA units form@@ atted hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface surface . &quot;
&quot; at hem@@ ac@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , a sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required . &quot;
as an intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tra @-@ muscular administration in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle could lead to a subtle impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ie or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected to inj@@ ected , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tra @-@ muscular genes . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate inj@@ ecting , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us Sep@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ on vaccine vaccine was administered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study which was carried out with 3 vaccines in this formulation , was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ eration and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccines . &quot;
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ d@@ ants Ambi@@ rix were administered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared with the 3 @-@ doses com@@ bin@@ ational material .
only exceptions were the higher prevalence of pain and mat@@ ernity on a comp@@ uted basis for a vaccine being Ambi@@ rix but not on a date basis for each person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of pro@@ b@@ ins compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % among pro@@ aches of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses com@@ bin@@ ational material .
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of pro@@ aches , the Ambi@@ rix had received , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the pro@@ aches that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage com@@ bin@@ ational material . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of matrix was , however , compared high ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9,@@ 6 % of pro@@ aches , the Ambi@@ rix got , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % at the prob@@ es , which received the 3 @-@ doses com@@ bin@@ ational material ) . &quot;
the incidence of pre@@ matur@@ ely pain and matrix has been low and comparable that was observed after administration of the com@@ bin@@ ational vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - up to 11 @-@ year old vaccines the occurrence of local actions and general interactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that in case of administration with the 3 @-@ doses combined hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface surface .
&quot; however at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix had a frequent appearance of pain ( on the inj@@ ector ) per dose , not per week . &quot;
the proportion of vaccines that reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the com@@ bin@@ ational hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C with the Com@@ bin@@ ational hep@@ atitis C handle .
&quot; in clinical studies , which were conducted with vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.5 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ing rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second one month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - up to 15 years old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 2@@ 89 people whose immun@@ isation was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dosage amount is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - until 11 @-@ year @-@ old were obtained a month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations got either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ atted hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface surface .
&quot; for people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies have been proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine . &quot;
the immune response against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that of vaccine from 3 doses with a combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml has been established .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
&quot; if the first dose is Ambi@@ rix in the second year at the same time with the refres@@ hed Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ o , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ an and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ h @-@ d@@ umps @-@ vaccine vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical trial which was carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed for the present wording similar to Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ pen@@ se by eye @-@ speaking on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ water waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark Ur@@ in , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ id ) and other symptoms that may need a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child have been infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those according to a hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin attacks , air@@ not or swelling of the face or tongue . • If with you / your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the commen@@ cing of the second vaccine ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B / hep@@ atitis B vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ in@@ osis of this vaccine with reduced content to effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from individuals who suffer from serious blood@@ stream disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle tissue . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened in the muscle or treatment in your / its body &apos;s immune defence / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ o@@ di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vaccine is .
&quot; 21 Sa@@ w your doctor , if you / her child take further medicines ( including those that you can get vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated without prescription , or if you have received the immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate bodies and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is supposed to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ eren or breast@@ feeding women is usually not administered , except it is urgent need to be vacc@@ inated for both hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have been known since issuing the first approval for the authorisation , the CH@@ MP considers that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only been implemented in an Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to limited patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be inserted in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ f@@ ect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ ies ( brain @-@ damage as a result of high am@@ ental concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split into several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed up under the food mixed or through a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al nas@@ al ( due to the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a hypo@@ cris@@ p , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to ap@@ peti@@ te inf@@ ancy in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , wast@@ age , hydr@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , rash , rash , rash or weight increase . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) is at the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ ic cycle is effectively prevented .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the illness at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the application is inde@@ xed to all patients , where a complete end @-@ fish is already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ low fixed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life @-@ month ) then there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of protein intolerance and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ firm lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ini@@ am@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered in patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk to the emergence of o@@ zo@@ op@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach . &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat that corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with so@@ dium and ecumen@@ ical clinical clinical conditions . &quot;
da Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat on the liver and the kidneys will be to be used AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous off@@ ense of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a stolen loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found a hes@@ it@@ ating matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is re@@ activated at human beings in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ sted during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients appeared at least an unwanted event ( AE ) at 56 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with l@@ ass@@ aci@@ an , severe hypo@@ cr@@ ine , periph@@ er@@ al N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose entered into a 5 month old baby with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed in intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity . &quot;
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ li@@ ous active connection that acts through Ac@@ et@@ y@@ ying with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is exhausted over the kidneys .
&quot; Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ ic cycle can be assumed that for each gram can be produced using x@@ yl@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ am@@ ic nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is placed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early mani@@ resistant form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborn babies was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first life year to death .
&quot; due to the modi@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative path@@ ology ( so@@ dium and so@@ dium in@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to diagnose the survival of the newborn during post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) diagnosed diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many too mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ low solid form of the disease ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ oten form of Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ish encephalopathy and a prot@@ ectable diet , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat oxi@@ des to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate oxi@@ des with glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ dice , whereby Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ alli@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in case of so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ ic cycle , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ als , as well as repeated gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ alli@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous Gift of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycl@@ ones or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ y , after different doses Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal , no Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma . &quot;
&quot; with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single parts ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
the medication is received within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ sted product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ am@@ ic about the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us @-@ tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic substances treated ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children , who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with lo@@ op@@ la@@ ins ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a nas@@ al ro@@ ckets . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ ni@@ tin and ser@@ um prot@@ on in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ firm lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ini@@ am@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ atten@@ f@@ ters were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lic of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyram@@ idal cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with l@@ ass@@ aci@@ an , severe hypo@@ cr@@ ine , periph@@ er@@ al N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ie and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value . &quot;
on the basis of investigations about the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ ic cycle can be assumed that for each gram it can be produced using 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ am@@ ic nitrogen .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
according to a oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
this procedure contains the small Mess@@ l@@ spo@@ on 0.@@ 95 g the middle measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication by a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium and phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cking @-@ containing waste products that can accum@@ ulate after eating of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; when you have conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you take from AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the l@@ ac@@ tation period , you may not take the AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since the drug could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , Tur@@ is@@ iness were also observed , head@@ aches , tastes , anxiety , rep@@ ut@@ eness , memory disorders , and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istical states . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or using the notebook of your hospital for the introduction of appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you can considerably imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this manual information .
you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS according to the cart@@ on and the containers after &quot; suitable until &quot; specified expiry date .
&quot; as AM@@ MONA@@ PS looks and content of the AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If in your laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you take from AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS spread over equal single d@@ ots ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al nas@@ al ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;

&quot; the gi@@ ox will be used to prevent blood vessels in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this may help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox , in some gift or in conjunction with a Gl@@ y@@ cop@@ rot@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood@@ stream ) with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient is often a St@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the arter@@ ies ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood@@ stream , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; with the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ tis or Rev@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy ble@@ eding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with heavy hyper@@ tension or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 shared the European Commission of The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the transport of angi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ mid@@ market ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency access or when an early intervention is envisaged .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI app is carried out in a further consequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion should be increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a initi@@ alled bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one connected with intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bol@@ ted @-@ hub of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and the bol@@ d@@ osis quickly intraven@@ ously administered . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney functions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to one PCI ( whether by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inflation rate should be used by 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value under 225 seconds , is a second bol@@ ster dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to admini@@ ster and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ ster dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney disease , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in approval , the ACT placed 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In case patients with severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox con@@ fer@@ ed ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous G@@ par@@ c He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous h@@ ubs of the molecular sl@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or other components or against bra@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or higher blood risk cancer . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and subtle endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • he@@ avier kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood . especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even though at PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ to occur in most blood types to arter@@ ial point position , in patients , who undergo a per@@ sever@@ ance cor@@ on@@ ar@@ tery ( PCI ) while the treatment in principle can occur throughout ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should be considered a surveillance of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will be achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or thy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing machine ) it can be assumed that these drugs increase blood danger . &quot;
in each case the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thy@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological her@@ os @-@ parameters in any case regularly monitored .
&quot; the veterinary investigations are in terms of impact on the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the discharge or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes which need treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm is inj@@ ected or as permanent in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the glu@@ cose metabolism ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin is not effective .
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it affects faster and a shorter activity has more than a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a slow ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body can no ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes , in which the body can not be processed ins@@ ulin , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the modification of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
in the first study involving adults with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes has been a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.8 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin per adult .
in adults with type 2 @-@ diabetes the reduction of the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human@@ ly ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in , or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood circulation system .
September 2004 the European Commission shared the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ ows Deutschland GmbH for the In@@ pi@@ dra company in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of abdom@@ en ; th@@ igh@@ s or Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ el apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal det@@ ectors .
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ co@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin , the ins@@ ulin is reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the substance , the brand ( Her@@ - controllers ) , the isl@@ anders ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in the ins@@ ulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the disp@@ ensing of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ulated diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic crop protection ; these stat@@ uses are potentially vital . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; among the substances that can increase the blood sugar activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine , fi@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ ine , fi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ ox@@ al@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ x@@ yl@@ ate , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pin the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter @-@ regulation may be de@@ ported or missing . &quot;
&quot; Animal Experim@@ ental Studies on Re@@ production @-@ productive studies showed no difference between in@@ sw@@ apping and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ ence enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally the ins@@ ulin occurs neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; following are the clinical trials known from clinical trials , grouped according to system organs and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very frequently : ≥ 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rarely : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - silent , cool and bl@@ ur@@ red skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , fear , concentration of creation , ben@@ ch@@ ur@@ ism , du@@ st@@ ness , changes of ten@@ dons , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea and cardi@@ ac clo@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Candi@@ d failed to change the injection within the inj@@ ector area , can occur in the episode a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy on the inj@@ ure office . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies with un@@ consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be given by means of in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting of glu@@ cose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a doctor treated by a doctor or by intraven@@ ous genes of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ cose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the urine thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin p@@ ens the blood sugar level by the stimulation of the periph@@ er@@ al glu@@ cose intake ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous fork in efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ li@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic field of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate increase in the glu@@ cose effect , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ in has a twice as fast impact entry than normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves total glu@@ cose effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Hum@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data , it was obvious that at an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ ly ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , became a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control than with human@@ ly ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
