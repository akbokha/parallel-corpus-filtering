<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets that arise in the mouth), as a solution to one (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirled thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not available), distrust and insanity; • Bienne-I disorder, an mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Abilify is used for the treatment of severe, serious Manical episodes and the prevention of manical episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of stolen anxiety or behavioural disturbances when the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"on both diseases, the solution can take for one or the melting tabletins in patients who are preparing the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who simultaneously take other medicines, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Arias prazole probably works as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Arias prazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than neurotransmitters works to enable the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripianzole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms, and their recovery is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, preventing the rediscovery of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that compared with a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was aged over twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-surgery, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent the reissue, to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that led by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, change in symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients said to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies by investigating how the body absorbs the melting tablettes and the solution to get absorbed (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients showed the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms stripped anxiety as the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five Kurzz studies have been more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify, in addition, up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes have been treated with previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms stripped anxiety and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramental disturbances), aculence (nausea), vomiting (nausea), vomiting (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, ruin and exhaustion, ruin) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humanitarian Care (CHMP) is to conclude that the benefits of Abilify the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, the predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes said to the treatment with Aripiprazole, opposite the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the quick control of increased anxiety and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes, if a oral therapy is not suitable to predominate the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission shared the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of beet disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a holding dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness in doses of a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>

<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and biased disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient, a lower initiating dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"when the CYP3A4 Inductor is made from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
