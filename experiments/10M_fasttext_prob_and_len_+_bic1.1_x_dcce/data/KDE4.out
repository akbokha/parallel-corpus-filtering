&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... open the card card tools and select the desired module there . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or ; on the extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to overthrow , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module point filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different types .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree @-@ view in &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or , select the DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display begins with the root marks of the document , example : Docum@@ entary element , all other knots are sub@@ elements of this litter traffic . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type I@@ node / directory is used in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different toolbar and text views in order to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the partic@@ ularity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , t@@ ach@@ ed Fol@@ der hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map graphically . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it . thus , large files , even then easily be detected , if they are far down in the folder . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ es @-@ depic@@ tion a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation , possess the rectangle of meaningful colours and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rectangle , which is switched on view color mode , can be either set depth for easy detection of the sharpen@@ ing sti@@ ff or the illustration of a different file peculi@@ ar such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be lab@@ elled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if enough space for display exists or whether the surface of subordin@@ ate controls will occur . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; when setting algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ ats in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be observed . it &apos;s possible to make sure that the subordin@@ ate entries will no longer be available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left . here , it is designed for the accused and avoiding space loss due to always advantageous the areas resulting in square . the best methods in this are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive second division . &quot;
&quot; you can indicate the minimum area for an entry over the menu entry point . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the assigned entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was thought , as a small test use and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery you can find in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&quot; an easy to use camera interface is provided to you , so that you can connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; # . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) will be used as a USB mass storage device . the camera can be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; photography came ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , continuing software collection , which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to computer machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transfers to the serial port it is now out@@ dated ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bit@@ if support has been created by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photographs . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photographs . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photographs or the generation could possibly be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to read and digi@@ tization is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to add , and digi@@ ti@@ fied ; by writing a small module to complement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; you can drag and drop images everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the alpha tree , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or in another application window . the only restriction is that one image is not in the keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to cur@@ ate the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields shown in the toolbar . so the filters on the fil@@ ename will be displayed only when this ind the toolbar will be displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog box .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo@@ graphies . these albums are stored in a single album , in which they have been created on the hard disk , in which the album was created first , the date can be changed into the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select the album Import screen photo . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move the photo from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album or move it . in the then released menu you must select whether to move the image through moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album . &quot;

&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection is used for sorting your photos , if you want to add or delete records from the toolbar . if you want to add new collections or delete records , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort out your albums after date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons , average , new : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this is first trying to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead . &quot;
&quot; if you first got an album in &amp; Editor , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; you &apos;ll help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo of the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;

&quot; photos with key@@ rings provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ise . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keywords can be assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which have been marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thus , you can organise your keywords . you can also squee@@ ze parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so you can find the keywords that you are looking for , easily find . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and gaining key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG . in addition , the keywords in the loss of the database re @-@ imported , as soon as the pictures were noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word click on &amp; quot ; or on an existing keywords , then click on an existing keywords , after you have an existing key@@ word , this becomes the sub@@ title of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word by right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to slide . a key@@ word may be at a time only in the tree .

&quot; this rider provides an intuitive map tool available on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press and move out and move it . move it during the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses the image Ge@@ o data . &quot;
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; digi@@ tization : presents a lumin@@ ance in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image files , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any point in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lighthouse add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the ligh@@ table and its window opened ; the main window are , you can open the lumin@@ ance quickly with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail you can draw the pictures you want to compare , to the left or right corner of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area can be seen . so you can preview the image or de@@ port@@ ations of one of the images , then they will be compared to the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to read quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise navigate from the toolbar , then the left mouse button will automatically display in the areas to the compar@@ isons . the right narrow picture is displayed in the right section . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering act also work directly from the lumin@@ ance as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both screen@@ shots in the lighthouse . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the picture , you need to click this click and the &amp; L@@ MB to display . in the Mode Pre@@ view , both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
the zoom is working as well as in other views . simply use the zoom re@@ gler among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in the picture and beyond . this happens in both pictures if you are in the Mode preview .
what is a digital inventory - away from the process ? digital review considers each of the process of the process following the image was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos show , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory by . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , sho@@ oters and photos again . in doing so , we focus on the procedures for digital photo@@ gra@@ ves that we use . we consider downloading , re@@ ren@@ ame , backup , vali@@ dated , are waiting , waiting , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital inventory takes stock , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ized , sec@@ ized , transform@@ ated , assembled and exported content that hab@@ il@@ licit or cultural value hab@@ il@@ e.@@ quot ; &quot;
metadata are defined as data on data . metadata are provided in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not even know how many photos you have , then use the metadata to be used in a database as well as into the image files very fast search and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
the first thing you need and need to know before you maintain something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your machine . you need to decide whether other access to your photo is required if you want to switch it to a remote drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you eventually need to switch on a larger drive .
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location . if you were able to organize enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use a folder for images to print or publish it on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option metadata to be written in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; # . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information available in your database , but what happens if you want to change which to change ? it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins as you should now select every photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . it makes sense as you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now begin with key@@ word , key@@ word , as you proceed with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ onymous for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded sampling ; then the tree will insert the pictures to the right place . the changing of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords will be followed by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while it follows the trees .
&quot; the graphics shows how different metadata are over@@ cut . this is a very large representation , as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar dates are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ turing or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ze your metadata . &quot;
&quot; do not want to let most anyone want to see your photos just , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ court of the Al@@ lies ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you begin to dream , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion therefore has changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transfer to viewer to help Him via the mot@@ if that she moves to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it is strength only with a cap@@ tion for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; View , you can save any number of text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . KDE can even be exported to a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE will even be exported to your preferences in the label and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; remember the times prior to GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities that use Ge@@ olo@@ c@@ alize are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can virtually repeat your journeys through pictures with geographic data . you can also export the photos on reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps API . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings site of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; when information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo , e.g. to add the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can not be changed . this field does not support com@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; title title ( syn@@ onym for version of the photographer ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the working @-@ name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles , freelance photographer or independ@@ ant commercial photographer . since this is a note on the car field , it must also be filled out . &quot;
&quot; editors ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider to identify who runs the photo . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed for a message agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a stock photo , the group / agency will provide the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . each of which has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals this protection is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image unique . and , in the near future , such a module will be available for st@@ acking processing . &quot;
&quot; topics : record errors , record loss , electricity clas@@ hes , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing , redund@@ ancy , lifestyle , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that you can happen to traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; bank@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated cau@@ tious , and you can no longer trust as a couple of years . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece has a lifetime of 100 years for himself . whether you believe it is in your measurable room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good discs and good reception devices and use them in the right way . the best DVD creator devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much depend@@ able . so it &apos;s about choosing the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you &apos;re just written just . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect itself . therefore , using this massive protection , it requires through chemical ageing , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a more favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to work with CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that sh@@ damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , USB drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
op@@ tic Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ ing War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty years the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good absorption device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and then on a clean , dark dry and above animals protected place . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ppy disks reserve your statistics for itself . their manufacturing locations include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ error study &quot;
&quot; shortly : Dis@@ ks hold at the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ ament , the error @-@ rate may not determine . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed errors . these are especially readers and publishing . the expected lifetime term is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an output if you have secured the files , but these losses usually leave without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices power does not make much of account , that can cause severe damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious harm , complete data loss , hardware conversion , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects , so protect yourself in front of the und@@ es@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not any plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider that it provides the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that he protects protection against flas@@ hes and thus protects the correct connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that also all the periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers place transi@@ tions and also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ dems and television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . they are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; during an over@@ voltage protection your system protects from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides protection against over@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy . this gives you the possibility to store your data and re @-@ run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety with electricity distur@@ ban@@ ces with the cost for avoiding these . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than $ euro ; it is just a small price difference if you think about how good your machine is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you drive into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . using the right configuration you can use this as a backup software under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are compared to the HDDs at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . this is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . the professional variant will not be available in full resolution online . the professional variant will not be available in full resolution . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the Web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically re@@ united thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred not when this occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ noticed until you have no protection to your computer . no one seems to have thought it in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data base than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss since they generate interference within the data streams . with normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes a year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to handle and highly scalable ones . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that is used for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . not@@ ebooks is already the proportion of the theft of 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them . it is limited to a lower damage , such as theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer have been seen before . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , cancellation , J@@ FS and X@@ FS in order to call the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rup@@ tive data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . sensitivity and smo@@ other characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else affected by a loss of data . thus , your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as the re@@ install of your operating system , sharing plates or size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash fails you have luck when the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ et is always a local storage . bring your back@@ ups the stairs into the neighboring building , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above it is a common reason for a loss of loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been modified since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . creates several moments at any time to restore such backup . backup comes next with the exception that it is only ab@@ ed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scrip@@ ting copies only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other op@@ tic medium .
this procedure allows you to detect losses and restore it . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for each month . every additional th@@ inner should be done manually after you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , owner , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that &apos;s about the time span in which you truly are interested in because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you need to consider everything today with caution . unfortunately , there is no other option to be compatible with caution while the current system is running back@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to rate the issues of the future . &quot;
&quot; this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use , or change to open standards supported by many applications . &quot;
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the opportunity for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means that actually means more and more .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have plans the scal@@ ability , and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command dm@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not depend on it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; DD / dev / s@@ db # source is / dev / s@@ db ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; b ; size of the plate in M@@ B@@ gt ; # functions with ext@@ 2.@@ 3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ e@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it any longer . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GI@@ F . however , it can be much more . it &apos;s relative to use X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can use Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mati@@ cal data for improved colour information , but not as many as TI@@ FF needs and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free com@@ ver@@ sion@@ ing centres ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . it is however , with some cameras , you can store your images in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open resource @-@ format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed by the needs of the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera controllers is now available and we hope that the co @-@ competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some time .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology , is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers take it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits as it saves the metadata separately from the image file and the image file and as indicated above , the raw format is processed . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards , which includes a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and collaborative efforts in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ depth acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; you can import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera are available , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archives . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut under circumstances from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in Web@@ gal@@ eries , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section Ad@@ ditions to an album you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to Import images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , connect them to your computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . when the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not have all the information available . &quot;
&quot; tab Met@@ adata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notable , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as when the metadata side@@ bar come from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ Please note that this metadata are not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; # . during downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired processing methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download it . the button chosen has been selected until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported , an option New download is available . these pictures have not yet been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in advance . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All downloading or chosen download , a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos are sorted out . details about the folder sorted can be displayed in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired pictures , you can delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the button delete all . if you just want to delete it , so you must select this first and use them manually . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility there are photos that you deleted from the camera . so , the photos are not deleted from the camera ; if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once again after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be reasonable , the date and time when the image was made to integrate in the fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and date @-@ based immer@@ sion . if you use this last option , a folder will automatically be created a day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concern the data via the author in the section standard auto@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all of the downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % Y@@ - % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further modifications , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; when you use the option camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters , or in large letters if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , which &amp; # came ; used for a photo , is displayed beneath the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used if you open the next time the camera ster . &quot;
&quot; I came to read all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo , read . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , lets you choose the photo . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button below and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is made information about the date in which the photo was made available , it can use it . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read , which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option below and select the option data @-@ based immer@@ sion at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from their computer to load their camera is the button to download . select the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears , in which you can select the files you want to be up@@ loaded , you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , asks and digi@@ tization . you where the images are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . click here to start the folder and click OK to load the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . it is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone is using a plane to make an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental pl@@ anner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can click on a browser which can locate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; check , users want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields are supported . so there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last over the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a map or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you need to save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the sign @-@ proof coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google@@ .com does not show any European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; I came to give you much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many attitudes which commands the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . to adjust to these settings , you must log into the menu settings . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview , or editing editing . you can thus view the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied , when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ed identity and copyright fields . this data is automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also when downloading from the camera location , this data is written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for version of the photographer : this field should be the profession of photographer , freelance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editors is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , if this is a photo photo ( such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be included here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the metadata are permanently available in the picture and are not only available in the database . these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; browsing .
&quot; image descri@@ p@@ ments as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments you have to add to your photos , with the images included in the pictures . therefore your compl@@ ements can also be read by other image terms , these are over@@ written by those of them ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse cursor in the main window via a file rests . depending on the chosen option this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; supports a number of different picture formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; display , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove . each file in one &amp; check @-@ folder , which has no one of these extensions , was ignored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have a , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the editing editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can choose them here . you can switch the toolbar in the full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the picture editing , this picture mode can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and off . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the following explanation . &quot;
&quot; using P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that image data is more time for training and un@@ pack . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value on a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sors for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm losses . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save losses . even if you have the los@@ sy adjustment , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , metadata were not yet supported , but it was still in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the image processing was only a picture @-@ bearing solution for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the editing . &quot;
&quot; the default note is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option using a minimum loss of details . this option marks the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option marks the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 bars patterns with the V@@ NG@@ C or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , when set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white is not set off . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white map which is photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting will only be supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details in the top . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the sh@@ red@@ der , so that the parts of your pictures are burned down , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to consider the sh@@ red@@ der . the setting colors will release some unusual results , as they show the sh@@ ri@@ cher in various ros@@ anc@@ ements . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ akers . &quot;
&quot; this is possible since blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ proportions of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee after your taste . you probably need to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; score . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small you should proceed conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to reck@@ on a complete image from the partial image sensor that have many cameras and which is available in a matrix colour . this algorithm is also known as the CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ break@@ construction .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . it generates color inter@@ pol@@ ation in the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour load correction , as you are carried out during the raw converting . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and check @-@ in ; information like the color information from a color box in the other are to be translated as accurately as possible .
behavior questions when a picture is opened in the image editing module with raw files .
&quot; colour profile Fol@@ der here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; check , this folder will then be examined during the Star@@ ts . &quot;
play the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile to be deposited . everything can be changed while opening the raw file .
the colour scheme view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures in colour@@ less not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera operator and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently there are some such as Canon , which does not have coloring tone or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ ture . currently , d@@ f Gamma does not need to conver@@ sions on 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color @-@ tone itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how to print your image from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore very satisfied . this could be correct , rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that match together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon extension expands the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutrality , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; imag@@ ery and pic@@ torial exercises . by using this interface , many modules are supported , to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some also in the context menu of the board . &quot;
&quot; short command for tasks that can be carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals for the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ ks the time between the transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other crosses fields turn the metadata a or out , which in the lower end of the images are built during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties indicate the list of all the cameras supported on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is connected to the computer , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image of the picture mode . currently , you are the serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / dev , where you connect your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digit@@ ally , you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out if you came out ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es ; if not , you can set camera cars and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
with the option confirming dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; images to the trash cans you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ls ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting a album you will find more details .
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be imp@@ lied with and digi@@ tised ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without questions , otherwise you need to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also bind the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in case of sub@@ types . this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ process of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; setting Bei@@ m start after new photos , I came to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting folder according to new or deleted albums / photos ; when something out of the base folder was deleted , asks and digi@@ ti@@ fied : you whether it should delete them from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be displayed under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is shown below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
and digi@@ ti@@ pped ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to watch your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the introduction .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; therefore they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the section image processing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file name , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar on the upper edge and below the toolbar for fast access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image processing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file or save the button save out of the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should ev@@ t@@ l a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file save .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by re@@ producing the original image from the menu File . you will lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot;
virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting an update or restored by editing them from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ um@@ b @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the reverse or re @-@ button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also und@@ o or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or same key@@ word by using navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image r@@ under or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can enter into the photo and zo@@ oming in which you are C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the plug @-@ in menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : enlargement factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can view it in the dialog dialog . you can view it in the dialog dialog . you can view it in the folder dialog . you can view this section to set up the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu image file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole sentences . whole picture @-@ pages can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ter printers . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the check @-@ out ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions available for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navig@@ ational pe@@ eling , also in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders will be clicked on : &quot;
multiple clicks Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or go back into the edge .
&quot; in the description view , you can type cap@@ tions with un@@ limited size or insert . please note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ C and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are tr@@ unc@@ ated after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on , use either the button or simply move to the next image , the compl@@ ements are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata attitude that is always written in the images . &quot;
the section evaluation shows a review of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting out . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keywords show a search box to filtering the keywords , the keywords and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ter ; -@@ session shall be ins@@ ure . &quot;
the tags will be dynamically adjusted to the key@@ word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is a further relief in the input of sampling at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
tags can also be set by marker of the corresponding cross@@ roads in the tree . all the words of a picture are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - dat@@ ors , key@@ word and view@@ points . if additionally one or more sampling filter from the right will be used . all the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw the keywords and put it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view , so you can simply draw it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog you ask if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window shows the pictures on a calendar tag . the keywords are selected at no keywords , which has been selected with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right word tree was drawn on the selection and there . a dialog is asked if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be replaced with settings Differ@@ ent .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it may be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already placed in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. set a further search of all the elements in the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options can be seen as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly to &amp; 4.0 ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you are using a color@@ managed workflow , the colors available from your camera or scanner will have a predictable aber@@ ration from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors will print on your monitor using your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the Web to make them out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the issue is coming to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the outcomes he wants . unfortunately , colour administration that you make informed about color management . the sense of this tutorial is to give you adequate information about color management . the sense of this tutorial will enable you to make adequate information about color management . the sense of this tutorial will enable you to make your own inform@@ ational decisions to make you hit the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image meets all the criteria listed below , then you must not take care of color management . &quot;
you can work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated at the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image files are sent via e @-@ mail or the Web , where the R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is standard . &quot;
&quot; so if the R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color system and do not have to make thoughts about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color dreams so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms Page and click on information and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I have decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB colour or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor since s@@ R@@ GB is that your ; on@@ itor on s@@ R@@ GB kit , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , then you need to use your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
the functions norm@@ alize the same , automatic shut@@ off and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rigi@@ dity Automatic correction automatically try to experiment out of your colors . you will be experimenting with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scalable the lumin@@ ance values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; same way : this method j@@ us@@ ates the lumin@@ ous fl@@ ection of the colors of the selected image , so that the hi@@ sto@@ gram of the Inten@@ sive area is as flat as possible . therefore , the absorption gives the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful surgery , which causes either wonders in an image or it destro@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; automatic Ab@@ like : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the rotor , green and blue canal . you determine the dark and light border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ ks the red , green and blue channels on the complete H@@ ist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a novel@@ ty of all values in between . this is only visible in sheer images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whi@@ tish of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ off correction is slightly limited because of a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform too far from original image . in case you can perform the white @-@ off in the blank mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode works , so your possibilities will be better off . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equation of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected . you start it on the menu entry , colors and white @-@ processing . &quot;
the pre @-@ sh@@ aking window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is to see dynamically the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ p . then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the magni@@ fier of the pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right side there is a hi@@ sto@@ gram displayed that dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful because , even in well illuminated images , most pixels have very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adju@@ sting it lets you improve the shadow details of your photo or even down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat with the above controls starts to play , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image below to use selected color for calculation of paint temperature of the whit@@ eboard . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed . they will display the combined result in the white figure . this is shown in the preview as re@@ iner indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . every adjustment of the whit@@ eboard you have set you can therefore save into a text file and re@@ charge later .
the button pres@@ ets pres@@ ets all filter values back on their default values and the corresponding neutral white @-@ equ@@ ations . note that also neutral settings can result in another photo as your original . if you save this it will change your original image .
&quot; you can set the codi@@ fication of each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high quality pictures . this co@@ ding is also needed for high quality pictures . this co@@ ding is also needed for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour cartridge can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be used to rate the chapter color management . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error , and therefore you can always find the same correction . in the manual of the sound correction , you can find more information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the check @-@ out ; tool color effects provides you four color effects , a photovoltaic effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar @-@ arization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans . the colored , dark@@ er areas sheltered and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity shows the picture what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates ultimately a neg@@ ativity that is not to be created on photo@@ cop@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vivi@@ d filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation so that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ oss . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via provides very saturated color for daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color , but also some photographers , especially those of the little landscapes , too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on in the contrast . the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the sli@@ ces re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on . in large pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the colour contra@@ sting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be satisfied in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can get a photo with bad light conditions you can get this revers@@ ed problem : one too great satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead . all changes that you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tools of gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ aire / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is sound correction . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need for the use of the sliding purpose only to the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the H@@ ist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graphs of the Inten@@ sive values , a hi@@ st@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ ite are three sliding into the inside and the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and observe how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side you can preview the original and the preview of the picture . Pre@@ view is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selective box can be configured whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ me@@ tic . for pictures of a constant color will often include linear hi@@ sto@@ gram of a single column . in this case the log@@ istical use of a single column is dominated . in this case the log@@ arith@@ me@@ tic division will be beneficial .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often Gam@@ ma@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the three shades of color p@@ all@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically mount the input , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
exit : the output criteria allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the output inter@@ actively as with the input rate . the compression of the output can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as background while something else in the background is visible .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensi@@ fication of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the values indicated in the file system can be stored and loaded later on . this will be used the Gimp level format . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ all@@ ets , the input checks will automatically be used for all shadows , means and sun @-@ tin@@ ts . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the inputs of the H@@ ist@@ o@@ grams for red , green@@ - , blue and the lam@@ bs channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect at the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output rated are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modify channel : this selection box allows the channel to be used by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ me@@ tic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode is generated by linear mode . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; if you can move e.g. a c@@ vent@@ ures to the right , e.g. the light sounds , then you can see that these light tones with dark@@ er output bricks and that the associated image pixels are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos there is a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the curve , the right line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down , until the value is after your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can therefore be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gimp curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ets buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the rotor , green , blue and light curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . shadow and sun @-@ tin@@ ts was set in the paint pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mix@@ ers of the &amp; digi@@ tization is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the channel Mix@@ ers is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel mix@@ ers of editing .
&quot; with the channel audio box , you can select the color for the hi@@ st@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line will appear in the hi@@ sto@@ gram to show you the corresponding colour value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and building allow you to mix these channels . this is particularly convenient when you also adjust the option Mon@@ och@@ rom , as the channel mix@@ ers then keep the option Mon@@ och@@ rom , as the channel mix@@ ers then change the tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible smoke , which will not occur in the same place in the color channel , and their smoking pattern is different from each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion so that you can reduce the color first . &quot;
the Save as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect at the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in the blue canal which has been re@@ activated . the original painting is activated ( 1 ) and the original picture under ( 2 ) .
black / White @-@ photography was always intrigu@@ ing due to your abstraction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working tre@@ k since colour pictures can be converted easily on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford P@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good , with all the scenery images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
or@@ anges : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a che@@ eks of Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Orange . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic step @-@ effect and can sim@@ ulate the mo@@ on@@ light to the day @-@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour setting and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yel@@ lowing .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle tones , while he adds a bit of cold in the shade of a print , and the re@@ development in a sep@@ ta oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ls ; tool texture can be used to apply decorative textures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind of portrait of enlarged points , or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry form texture can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ b@@ lance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text file has been applied to the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the check @-@ in ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to get the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ et@@ ting eye . under picture frames the module can be started from editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you place the desired Rachel type for your picture . thoroughly surrounded the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ acing it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a but@@ t and decorative frame adds a zapper with patterns . &quot;
&quot; width : indicates the width of the frame in percent , the value area for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; the target image with the frame image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before . &quot;
with this practical tool you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image of any point . this also goes on several places if you need it .
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text device , orientation , color from the colour area and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; after the image was saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; check , tool Sch@@ abl@@ one uses you can put a template over one image . &quot;
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one uses in the image processing can be used to draw s@@ abl@@ ons over one image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should add maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ list ; mail@@ ing@@ list check @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cil has been set out a building view , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under Pre@@ view , there are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button increases the above picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; res@@ ellers : this button res@@ ized the below picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to res@@ p the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail . &quot;
&amp; Sin@@ ce ; three different tools are available for sc@@ ams . each one of them has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges of a picture to look more sharp@@ ly . actually it doesn &apos;t use it rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focus is perhaps the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ tization process colors with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more thoughtful tigh@@ tening than normal cameras for the user .
&quot; at JP@@ EG images , a camera has often been applied . pictures in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner have a sharpen@@ ed filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value chain . this allows you to connect with the menu entry .
&quot; however , you should hereby avoid careful as the results does not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fication the noise . in general , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry . use the tool on the right side of the dialog window shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce often good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or the amount will increase the effect . if you make the un@@ shar@@ p mask too strong , rou@@ gh@@ ing and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a edges affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image which is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable differential amount . this way , a minimum difference can be used for a channel of the filters . in this way areas with a soft switch between the killing of shar@@ pen except and therefore beauti@@ full error in faces , des@@ ks and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ inary filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the pictured image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ cot was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focus is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyrighted unfolding filter for Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create an image to &amp; quot ; it is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ness of pictures is the use of an un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by placing colors Re@@ focus on image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular flow works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung is a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel , which is far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ ral F@@ altung is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius of the circular thread . it &apos;s the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the standard value should put 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on Hei@@ ligen@@ stad .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation may be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter may help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0,@@ 1 only rarely helpful . if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be even more f@@ eit@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch is . in most cases , you should use this value to zero in order to avoid poor@@ er arti@@ facts . if you use a value uneven zero , you might need to also increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ den smoke filter . &quot;
&quot; size size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ ation@@ sm@@ at@@ rix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular foam or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen loop . however , note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any number of re@@ focus parameters you have set will therefore be saved for later and can then be loaded afterwards .
try all the cutting , color and Inten@@ sive correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but they left in@@ convenient ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you have pictures to read and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur pol@@ ishing better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be causing the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
in theory it has to be bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ying always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show that it is the optimal linear filter . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in editing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small non @-@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to insufficient light for the car focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods for sharpen@@ ing correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ati@@ te sets the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the area of the dark to generate a more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; the color @-@ tin@@ ts allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool pic@@ kl@@ ash is one of the most advanced tools to remove the desired ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ side algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as a starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are shown below :
&quot; if you want to edit the filter settings on a j@@ us@@ line , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail post@@ ure &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a even@@ ly smooth@@ ed above the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the details of detail always should be subordin@@ ated to the right @-@ dependence . &quot;
&quot; scheme dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gran@@ ularity or the CCD ru@@ ffles will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts will best be removed at a value nearby 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ es &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum capacity factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . put this value suitable to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more it is necessary , since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &quot; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ b effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . usually here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , there should be small angle to create a long runtime . you should thus choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step@@ per &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ per in pixels . you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low . he doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it out .
the buttons Save as and loading accurately this . any setting of image errors can therefore be saved into a text file and loaded later again .
&quot; picture errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button down@@ break@@ up . &quot;
below you can see how to remove image errors with small ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is applied to a photo that in Guatemala city with an analog camera is applied . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar arti@@ fact observed during the journey and del@@ del@@ .@@ The original image is under ( 1 ) to see the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses the protected algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens to remove . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ i@@ ots ; effects of sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sensor@@ rau@@ ghts from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it features a gran@@ ular smoke that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and allows the image to be bl@@ aded through the radius , and the color in it will be smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharpen@@ ed gel . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ bow down the filter at the front to determine illumin@@ ants . if the value is high , the adap@@ tive filter image details no longer receive and ru@@ stling or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the cant@@ onal imp@@ rec@@ ision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency of the filter . if he is too strong cannot be removed all the ru@@ stling or ru@@ pe@@ es can occur . set it on a value nearby the maximum if you want to remove a sh@@ aking ru@@ stling or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or illumin@@ ant to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details that is controlled by the details .
color : controls the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend you either paint or illumin@@ ants to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ase of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark@@ er areas , which typically are more strongly smo@@ ked to increase . however , he also spar@@ ed the shadow of shadow . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ atter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of light density . if it is increased , the edges may occur too high . if he is able to occur on his minimum . he can remove drugs and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter in the edges . he can remove drugs and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters on smoking in@@ duction that you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how to change smoking har@@ ness your lives can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected with ( 2 ) is marked with standard settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry and experiment with the smooth@@ est shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce pictures .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ wil@@ lows , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sors , compres@@ sors and local errors , resulting in digital , original or noc@@ tur@@ ally digi@@ tised images to remove . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the picture cont@@ ours and thus gets the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and textile composition . the textile replacement is performed with another tool that was missing . the algorithm for restoration was developed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ag@@ ro and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compres@@ sing com@@ ver@@ sion@@ ers , he creates some com@@ pres@@ sions &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . &quot;
the buttons Save as and loading accurately this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later again .
photo recovery is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity smokers .. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ularity towards the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read by a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts created by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixels permits hot@@ spots of photos that were included with a CCD camera to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are particularly high in high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression has a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; at a picture with a dark picture sub@@ stitution method to remove . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture @-@ show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark picture directly after connecting new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the fitting dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically re@@ charge this automatically over the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct within the picture the result is correct . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all previous areas .
choose an area to see the defective pixels on the Pre@@ view and the results of the filter . then choose the best filters to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ation : it is determined an average of the neighbouring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are being approached to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
k@@ ub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be approached to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ lic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ lic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization is a tool for correc@@ ting the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , a picture to correct . &quot;
&quot; vast@@ ness objective , especially in the medium and large photo format , often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that the sensor can be reached there . Tele@@ objective is also able to demonstrate this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has disadvantages . many center filters require one factor 1.5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filter , which should be the necessary closures with hand filters , even with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ed effects may arise through movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film or gra@@ dations of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using a low @-@ bearing correction . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction is applied without this filter . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping manual and with three other expos@@ ing the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting absorption at the point of the greatest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is a optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , ent@@ ails . increases the density to make a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ance , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the image . you need to restart the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators provide you with only positive values as you only need to raise the settings . &quot;
if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ tuning of the target image so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma for zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive image . a lamp correction is also carried out in the image with this tool .
the gra@@ zes @-@ gra@@ zing is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lin@@ ts to photos . it uses the protected algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the coefficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect , fla@@ p but in the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of coefficient , corrected the remote corners opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; generally : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ ding . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values of the ho@@ ist distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the distor@@ tion . this value acts more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameters the parameters of the parameter is general . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads a correction of the first gra@@ ding through . negative values enlarge while positive the image are smaller .
&quot; bright : this value j@@ us@@ ks the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your photo will be saved and used as standard values at the next start . &quot;
the replacement or pad @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . best result in this correction as all first . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and then carry out a dip @-@ shaped correction it would be the effect of seem@@ ing the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the edge , or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the cast@@ ed / ho@@ ist distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a ho@@ ist distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can transform this with the cutting tool in the menu , cut off the image processing or via the zoom re@@ gler of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for most pictures ranges from the front . the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective so to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the foam @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has an sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the window of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; beneath the preview , you can set two parameters setting film gran@@ ularity and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of green gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of the green green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter channels used to reproduce infrared movies , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of an infrared filter applied to a landscap@@ ed photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the original picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set at ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ akers .
&quot; the digi@@ tization of the filters is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ules on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers have large silver bodies of the photo@@ em@@ ulsion . &quot;
&quot; the filming effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere released from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ny sight especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator can be the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of gra@@ ins . the standard value is , although frequently higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ based effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the recorded film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; check @-@ in ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin@@ ching size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth , the smooth@@ es and , from the other side looked like , the magnific@@ ence . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . twe@@ et size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ es 17 .
the &amp; Ph@@ ases ; Filter coal @-@ drawing used to create a K@@ ohl@@ ze . the lines that are slowly changing in the drawing are stressed . pictures of their gradient are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you &apos;d like to choose which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator controls the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ es the contrast ( smooth@@ es ) .
this is an example of the co@@ ding filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting the intensi@@ fication value .
the &amp; Ph@@ ases ; filter engra@@ ving in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses the protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filtering is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect again . he works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where colour does not use the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , is equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the pictured image ( 2 ) . the first depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
w@@ avel@@ eng@@ ages 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by gl@@ ass@@ als .
w@@ avel@@ eng@@ ages 2 : analog to the w@@ avel@@ ength 1 the image is distor@@ ted here in a different version of glass @-@ blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image along the harv@@ ested lines that go by a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image by rotation of the pixels by a center . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharpen@@ ed of a rotating camera .
remove un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to go back in the background .
&quot; movement un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image through horizontal movements of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharpen@@ ed of a linear linear , z : B : made of a car or train &quot; &quot; photo@@ grap@@ hing , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ ten@@ er un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image soft into the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dream@@ y and shiny soft focusing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portrait , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture by random shifting of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the w@@ aning of an arbitrary camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the colour basin in the picture and caught them without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the filling with an average pixel . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make Re@@ gent@@ es on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a great appearance . it uses a protected algorithm .
&quot; dro@@ ple@@ t size allows the size of the drop to change . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size is not automatically growing with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . quantity changes the optical effects of the drops on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can keep up with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; editing a section free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face which will be free to stay . if you start the filter reel , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain @-@ pes filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the pictured image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values have been used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong guidance so you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu or transform mirrors .
photo infl@@ amed is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to res@@ tra@@ der is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture infl@@ ated and the details sharp@@ ly ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again , makes it a good work . try it and you will see it ourselves . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size , select in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation such as Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ amed was developed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are shown below :
&quot; maintained aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more it is necessary , since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &quot; van Gogh &apos;s turtle effect , he must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons Save as and loading are used exactly for this . any single load for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later again .
photo infl@@ ated is very fast with what it does but it can still take a very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo bl@@ ends by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a common surgery , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle . you will then see that sp@@ eck as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . thus you can change a good overview of your photo after cutting . you can drag the size of the rectangle . you can create the size of the rectangle . a new rectangle can be created by simply drag it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut@@ out , use the button The feeder button of the image editing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save file Save or file Save in the menu file to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in advance , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool to cut the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the higher value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you use cen@@ timet@@ res , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo@@ cop@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to manage the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set the area on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the assem@@ bling assistance enable help to hide in order to make your pictures better together . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions are based on the principle of similarity . as the third party rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the Golden Center is a division that is on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shells or the bl@@ acks of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which makes the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 8 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 , etc . a composition that is usually follows as visually harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden center provides fluid relief lines when you set up a picture . these help are enum@@ er@@ ased down :
the Golden spiral will lead you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party rule the golden spiral leads the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric river .
&quot; another rule are the rectangle of the golden spiral , also called golden rule . this rectangle are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . that &apos;s something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the mid@@ points of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles . take note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , Golden Tri@@ angles are not equ@@ itable tri@@ angles . Di@@ agon@@ ale to place these lines can be placed a static object of dynam@@ ical . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called by professional photographers at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the Help line . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera out exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the image ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rot@@ ation and j@@ us@@ es the target angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button preference you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side .
&quot; to your help , the module is free rotation and a vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse cursor in the picture above to position the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you select the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this it is the function transform@@ ers from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transformations are performed by a fix@@ ture on the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; after adjustment of the perspective the picture becomes a little scr@@ aper . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to pull it is to cut it the picture with transform the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal shaft e.g. becomes the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a turn , the picture is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can transform this module over transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; tap your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically simultaneously , the angles on zero are set . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; to your help you will find a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to a key point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool for your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the lubrication , the image is caught a bit . for a single cry this effect is usually neglected , but two sw@@ ings produces twice as much embarrass@@ ment and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the lubrication , the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write columns . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries have been comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
the file extension has only shown files in formats . this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is displayed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras will allow you even to select the format used . a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; check out ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compres@@ sive on digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data on a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JP@@ EG with the same compres@@ sion@@ ing . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&amp; Editor did ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is contained in &amp; digit@@ ally . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; digit@@ ally .
many digital cameras support the inclusion of short movies . these clips are often saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG format ; but it is not a film processing program and therefore has no built @-@ in ways to display or edit . if you click on a movie file and click here ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies to play the program for playback .

many tools that you need the photo@@ processing need are included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; the description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft characters , smo@@ ker , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ red before the filter on the current picture is applied . below you see &amp; quot ; texture an@@ wen@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the pre @-@ view . these modes are :
vertically share without duplic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected pre@@ views .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without duplic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the under@@ side shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre@@ views . &quot;
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper area shows the original and the lower to the comparison of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the pres@@ ch@@ ist , and otherwise the original . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) : there are two buttons , you can switch to show over@@ - and under@@ exposed . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can draw this frame with your mouse inside the image and drop in the part of the picture , from which you want to preview . the preview of the dialogue will be updated immediately . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all the buttons on your default values . all settings depend on the latest use of the module . &quot;
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data originates from EX@@ IF data when these data are available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive map tool available on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press and move out and move it . move it during the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses the image Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is a editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and naming colours .
&quot; the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and nar@@ rated color . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by curved to the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the color is described under the pal@@ let view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose out . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ line Bei@@ m cursor under the button color will add , the color is inserted from the color board at the cursor . the color will either be inserted or write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . you can adjust if the mode over@@ write the cross @-@ box over@@ write under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection which has been created as described in the last section , can copy and paste together with the promotions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ color@@ edit ; used the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each colour three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a second color character , if another color follows . if there are three num@@ eric values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colours in the palette and the output selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then you will find it in the colour selection on the left . &quot;
&quot; &amp; graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Grap@@ h ; graph@@ ers are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visualize graphs ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions . &quot;
the &amp; GUI viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; GUI viewer ; is a KDE program to watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ . the &amp; graph@@ ers ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ite ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph@@ ers re @-@ calculated and presented in &amp; graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or open Grap@@ h in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open in a &amp; K@@ ate ;
&quot; loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack , to represent more than these knots ) &quot;
&quot; other needed software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; ch@@ graphically . without an argument , the main window appears empty as in the bottom of the screenshot . in this case , the toolbar icons only open the symbol file and the ( blank ) list opened files . click on the first icon to open the file file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel use ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum lifting of a graph@@ ite .
&quot; when the file has been changed in &amp; graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change , so that later procedures will change . if you want to change your decision later , you can adjust the menu item Settings . set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open an Grap@@ hic file outside a running &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance opening , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; to open the instance , or want to represent the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; during the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be split into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graphs . &quot;
page show with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the page again gives you the opportunity to set the behavior when a file was altered on the hard disk , and eg by another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or program each time . &quot;
&quot; the site Open gives the opportunity to define the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer , if a Grap@@ h will open for this case ( the Grap@@ h will open in a new window or define in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) , or determine that each time will be asked . &quot;
the site administration gives the opportunity to set up the start @-@ behavior of &amp; GUI viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; it opens up further options : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for orient@@ ated graph@@ ers . he produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of aligned graph@@ ers . the algorithm sets the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as possible as a few cant@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ covering graphs . it produces depic@@ tions in accordance with the jumping spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statis@@ tically multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs , a spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ing@@ model layout . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ sh@@ atter@@ proof for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the Cir@@ co ; algorithm sets the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams by multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the Grap@@ h after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layer command you can give you &amp; eg ; the graph algorithms allow special options , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates into the metadata of a picture and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available to loc@@ alize images geo@@ graphically in spherical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ des and lati@@ tudes are used thereby . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphical localization Kor@@ rel@@ zer . this interface can create a number of selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the top to visual dialogue appears then . to load a possible correlation of time and localization by , you need to download a trace file with GP@@ X file , such as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file loaded a automatic correlation is performed by the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are stored in GMT times and therefore the camera dates are calculated with the GMT . this can be performed with the time zone . put here your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and comra@@ de . lies the devi@@ ation below the data is combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related all the images in this field .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality , a locality in a large difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you notice a number of photos at the same place . since the dialogue will use the coordinates of a call for the next one , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map and to be found and set . select this in the relevant region and enlarge it . the amount must always be chosen manually . the card can always be chosen manually . the card can be switched between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a st@@ acks of images with GPS data .

the tab has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below will appear the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ tex and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page .
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder from the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ 2@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , the file size is of course also the file size . all other settings are even explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; tab shows you some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press Cancel to break down the process .
&quot; when the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program@@ ing messages to determine whether errors are encountered during the creation . the web browser will automatically end up to preview the gallery . click to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I sculptor is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool for viewing pictures .

&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a base imaging . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides . &quot;
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . with this module it is possible to create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start the module for Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images you selected are then enum@@ er@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan the file on a TV , you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds , the one image will indicate . the speed of the image below will be specified . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image exchange . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the generated file you can define under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you start all the settings to your wishes , you can go with the button co@@ ding the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slides if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages over the button Settings right down . &quot;
the print driver allows for multiple images to print on a sheet paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.g. useful to improve you or to print the Gimp module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your stored images in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ lines d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original apartment from Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera controllers . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image converter will then be in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values new to optimize the conversion process . the first option will decide whether the camera settings are used for the whit@@ eboard . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fi@@ ers can be j@@ us@@ sion@@ ed . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converter results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and use los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to process your images frequently or later use otherwise you should not select the JP@@ EG format since it is limited only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
if you select JP@@ EG as memory format the metadata that are contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data .
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button to start the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can do so . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert various pictures to one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility to over@@ write file automatically . this is helpful if it is created in a previous attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar is not available as far the conversion . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be ren@@ ame for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start@@ up and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the use . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ p the image res@@ eller or enlarge . in addition , four types of image change are provided : &quot;
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepare the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ers . the target image , including background size , size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of additional images beforehand . further images can be drawn on the list of images to sen@@ ing images and put it there .
&quot; after you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more pictures with a file sel@@ ector . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to you to add the list of the pictures to you .
&quot; with the button of images , the selected images are removed from the list of the pictures to be found . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are attached as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
do not watch out too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions to send to the size of emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every@@ time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a sent file , the comments to the pictures are put together into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among loss of free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG in pictures file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ dates are added to sen@@ ing pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for mistakes . your e @-@ mail program will automatically be started at the end . with the button Connect you can rip this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module of the module , a window with questions like your de@@ asch@@ au will have shown . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will be enabled very elegant image outputs by OpenGL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the slides can be very slow . &quot;
the file names show you that the fil@@ ename of the pictures in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures acci@@ dentally select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
&quot; under del@@ aying between the pictures , the tempor@@ al distance can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should be au@@ st@@ est before you show the presentation your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally choosing a different effect on any transition between images .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date j@@ us@@ i currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to put an image as a background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module comprises the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu as the background for your KDE work@@ surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ photos ; see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in persons , places and in group tags . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you entered information as you entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the associated entry , the view of your browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select a further person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can see with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; photo@@ photo album ; however , for each person a separate image , which is of course also available for places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button which you want to use the right outside on the toolbar . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category ( if you have a list of keywords for example ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must choose which image can be displayed for each individual person . to view this , you need to select the picture @-@ stop window as shown in the picture . here you can select the picture for the appropriate person . in the course window you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the picture should be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; when you access the entry window , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to the dialog for the fixing of the image properties . this dialog you can view on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description , the compl@@ ements and descriptions of images will be searched for this text . if you like , you can also use a date for example , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ photos ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather like to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this handbook : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; photo album ; and in the first dialogue will start the demo , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu help menu entry into the photo album . then , some example pictures are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo@@ graphies . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . one picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you dat@@ ums about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different periods . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by pointing the ly@@ re only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline , you may inter@@ actively use the following ways : you can select the displayed file view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of the date shows you the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the Lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so if you select an area , you will be shown in the preview view only pictures of this tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ graphies ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual the integrated version is described in &amp; photo@@ graphies ; integrated version which you can create via the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the surplus and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ photo album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is created ; the export file is to be created on the overview page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer also without description . for example , that all pictures are exported without description . you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain considerations . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , why this is not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download the example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator of your site can change the resolution at any time . so he can search your pictures with low resolution , which results to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this setting area you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select your HTML files for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . you can select either a folder or one from KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really all for viewers will be visible . if you have created a URL for the base folder . the URL you have created here , the URL should be created here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not able to manually copy it to the final destination folder , see , correctly , you need to specify the final objective of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders will be . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the settings described have all three on basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you can specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; photographs . you can of course add an HTML page to view images , reception , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ graphies , then you must not even do this work . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ photo album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the features are processed with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you distinguish themselves if the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage can be stored in the file , however , that you can pass this file independently . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images in a two @-@ fold manner . first , the images are found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the expor@@ ters of images described you can view over the menu File Export ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is to act either internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices :
&quot; in the option Manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ photographs album ; the images are automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not recommended to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this so you simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is the maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by example that each image is to be at a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file imports ... select , will import &amp; photo@@ graphies ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to imports consists of four steps . first you have to select , which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder that are to be copied images . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category people of the imported file person@@ er ( if you &apos;re a d@@ unge@@ on ) , while this category is required by your database individuals . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window which are to be imported to the imported file and which categories will match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step you can use the categories of imported file to imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , you can see an example on the image . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view : if you look at pictures , you want to see pictures of your Italy &apos;s vacation and discover a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) for information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and prestige to go through ( 3 ) advanced issues and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for car@@ et@@ ting your images . but it was extended and today , it also takes your videos . in many places this handbook will be talked about pictures , but frequently they also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; saves all of his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml at the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , backup to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in the CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your pictures are stored and used this case automatically . if you want to start another folder tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry settings , setup ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you will be able to change the settings of your photo album . in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; links you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 button and click on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can choose different characteristics , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; in view the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section under@@ categories , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than explained all the groups of a single entity . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options that are available to you for the feast of the member groups . with the above selection list , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left panel you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this handbook , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ graphies . however , most modules have a help page you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photographs have been tested . therefore , you can always test new modules first with the demo database &gt; &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules using K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ photos ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ graphies ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order according to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ graphies . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; photographer album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s going on @-@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ graphies ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category which you have specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you have for example the category people , will do &amp; photo@@ photo ; so if you have chosen people to view and share it on the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog and select the module modules which are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start &amp; photo album , starting with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu and a toolbar . at the moment you will not find any information about your pictures . in the section we will display on this window , now click on the item images to show you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photographs album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes , where the picture was recorded , etc . you can put each image either separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pictured and all pictures in Copenhagen have been included . &quot;
&quot; all these comments may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists using a text field by setting up persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ graphies . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ photo album , as you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the moving of images within the list : if you are for example a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find the people more quickly and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list below . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected remarks to each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and select these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . click in this case simply click the front and back @-@ buttons , which are placed under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California all lie in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the short@@ cut , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ s or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category and place it there in order to sort this to an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tical order . see below . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the tra@@ des@@ ti@@ ses by moving and move the body that make the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by setting it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click On the button Options ... that offers you the opportunity to store the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and here window will see a / out . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images displayed in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all the images in case you have no filter . an example for this . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as wallpaper for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture @-@ box . if you have not opened a window with an image above , a new scor@@ eboard will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture look . simply select the appropriate pictures from the menu or select either the remove button or select Edit selection . now , the window will be shown that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use them with &amp; photo@@ photos ; i.e. images also use , without you to have saved on your hard disk . of course , you need to record the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures where the right upper left is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function needs you to copy files from folders and copy it back . if you still not want to avoid the inser@@ ting of the relevant CD . so if you want to avoid trouble , like the m@@ ess Br@@ ing of your pictures , please buy a larger drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy so that at the end the ones you want to make available to others , you can also see all the pictures that may see your little sister and choose the menu item except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you set out which pictures in the case of traps are to be hidden . if you want to block the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures , which you will have locked . if you want to check the pictures again , click Sper@@ re lift up . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for example , all pictures on the hard disk and on the other can anyone who can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text ; this type of password protection serves only to those who have a look on private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ graphies ; manage and hours over hours , of course , to describe it is of course that you want to see them at some point . for this reason &amp; photo album . you can look at the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer allows you to see in it . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you enter about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag and drag it differently . all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed on the viewer . then you can see the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; some words in the In@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne H@@ ene . as if you were interested in the browser and then Anne H@@ ene selected . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slideshow . how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the Str@@ ong button and Plus or minus . it will be stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo@@ graphies ; it is able to switch in the full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete seat on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move into the picture and zo@@ oming . for her@@ edi@@ o@@ omes you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse button . with the minus button , the plus button zo@@ om@@ t can be highlighted in the middle of the picture . shows how an zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point @-@ button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the original key puts the zoom , so that every pixel is equivalent to the screen of an image of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work in videos will work , that in and out , with the plus and the key . &quot;
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do comments on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures it can happen that you will have a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the picture and open the configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and look at further pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to draw pictures with features . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the respective letters . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have known features to your pictures , they are available to you in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail view . if you can view all categories in D@@ re View , then you can simply hit the letters for the feature by simply click the letters for the feature , after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; photo@@ album ; on the image to paint .
&quot; the mixture will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can see a picture on the painted world . to switch on the painting image from the context menu . to finish the image , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object into the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; if there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following re@@ folding menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with deletion from the menu bar , editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click apply to apply these changes . do you submit invalid values , a message will be shown with an error description . then you can click the input error and then apply the changes with ab@@ rup@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the interior dialog box , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the owner &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the owner &apos;s view and a small example of the scene with the selected texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting , the entire texture is cut , even if you want a subordin@@ ated element . if you just want a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift through drag and mouse over the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visual effects . you can indicate this value relative to the visual level of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object , or as absolute value . objects are only shown when they are selected , or their visual effects are smaller or equal to the world &apos;s toolbar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window @-@ order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window @-@ order or if you need any other arrangement , you can adjust it as you can . you can also store several window orders and easily switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under one point view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle shows then the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the drop in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window @-@ order are flo@@ cking views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to drop a view from the anchor , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small to the left corner of the board . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the little cross in the list box . to prevent the closing , click the little square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for each type of views . new views are f@@ aint , you can anchor them at any location . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with window pane , and save a dialog box where you can save the window @-@ order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written in &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ own the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ der icon in the toolbar or select the menu item scene . &quot;
a R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various sizes and quality levels you can insert as many r@@ ender modes from a quick preview of up to full pictures in the highest quality .
&quot; if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each rel@@ ational mode has a name . you can type in any name , but it is a name that lets the characteristics of the mode can be recognized . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the image @-@ made image . if you want to ren@@ ame only one small area of the image , select the cross @-@ box section and enter the image cut into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality you can select the characteristics that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray , for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user Guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when a picture is measured with just one beam of pixels , there are often different mistakes . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or beads effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect means ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally speaking pictures with this property is better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adap@@ tive , recur@@ sively because every pixel is always split up and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ing depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray exceeds the pixels depending on pixels . if the difference between the color values to the neighb@@ oured pixels are dealt with super sampling . if you adjust the woo@@ p at 4 additional points , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a lowering value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 bla@@ sting depending on the pixels . when the difference between the color values the pre @-@ defined threshold then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that can be followed individually and checked for further classification . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set by lowering .
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to switch the production of drugs for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn to J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray , the bla@@ sting of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu entry file imports ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; still not the full command line of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object into the editor . to import objects in the scene , simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on the help in the personal view , opens &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . put here the path to your documentation and the version . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files which are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to insert the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object catch of points to the grid @-@ menu of the wire model views . you can set the R@@ aster separately for de@@ port@@ ations , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values can result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better price for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the bul@@ let , you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to return . &quot;
&quot; when you view a wall , a wall behind the objects is til@@ ted . the wall is shown in a chess boards from two single stell@@ able colors . &quot;
&quot; when you want to display ground , a ground below the objects is til@@ ted . the floor is shown in a chess boards from two single stell@@ able colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the gly@@ col , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . exact details of the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window pane , you can create and store window orders . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field Standard shut@@ ters : displays all existing Window boards . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window @-@ order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list available window lines displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added with the button Add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
any window @-@ order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column allows you to create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ plug the window below the existing window , with the previous view and vibr@@ ating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you would like to follow any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , under beginners very popular : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings that you will receive as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only receive a black image . &quot;
if you have installed everything error @-@ free you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; following specified window @-@ order :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation , so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . you now have a scene without objects .
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the opinion object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions subject , but note that the camera in view control points you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the file paste , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehensible method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides an easier option . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button or enter the button . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view also displays the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree , you will find that you can check the entry for the ground if you click on the icon at the bottom . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just so you can get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and adjust the values as below : &quot;
&quot; only choose the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment you choose something different . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . you can change the object in the object tree ( name = ground @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks right now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you always remember that you can view the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest ways . &quot;
&quot; if you do not view any color on the qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button to apply and then call the Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you ren@@ ame your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you have expected to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to do two new attributes . then , select this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree every time @-@ big and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step should you simply be able to run , as you should have understood the basic practices of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button apply ) , so the ball is float above the ground as you have shifted the ground to move a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering results in now a strange result : as before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a matt @-@ black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose First sub@@ items and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click sphere Pig@@ ment , then choose one @-@ big and put the values as below : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish characteristics : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ caps and click on the button or press Enter .
&quot; the attitudes of splend@@ our effect and reflection arise partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ mon@@ y@@ pricing is a r@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ derer kno@@ cks of hypothe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog have been causing fog . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously each scene which is to be converted , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have saved the model , it is saved under the same name . is it a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
rest@@ ores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last store are rejected .
&quot; this menu entry , you can only select if you do not have any stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeat the most recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used editing options . &quot;
&quot; stores the current window order and opens a dialog box where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands with this option .
open a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove machine icons for &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler in this option .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to feed @-@ out surfaces , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without change the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens , or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels basis by applying an image file as colour card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a more comfortable and browser @-@ browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
pictures can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in the full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the button return .
&quot; you can set whether every image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a particular file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ ename appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short commands for the display and short command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can further down . pre@@ setting is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the end the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this will be used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can create &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so that only some of the file types are displayed that the program can also be present .
this option is extended for big images to the scor@@ eboard to the full screen . this option is switched as pres@@ et@@ ting .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image change during a slideshow . to change the value , you can insert a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . is this value to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until they enter the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards @-@ cards for the scor@@ eboard and short command for the browser .
this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the included view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays big icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
res@@ ized the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
enlarged the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
includes the scor@@ eboard for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the check @-@ in ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful tools . you can use it to watch your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; makes it easy to report as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information will be filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; and hopefully soon you will be able to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , you should be aware of this language so powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; show@@ photo ; to join it , it is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that have the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; change to these settings must be divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by pressing the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; in the range of exposure Indi@@ c@@ ators , you can choose the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator should display the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposed should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view them in the image editing . you can view these items in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that can no longer be used as images and p@@ ans .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images that can no longer be used as images and save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the file .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ d@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no default scanner was specified , a dialog to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the sc@@ oring scanner and click OK to open the scanner . Cancel
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options especially .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can only start a preview can and then start scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can also zoom in the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also set the zoom as well that the complete preview in the window fits . &quot;
if the picture is selected then the final image can be read with the Scan button .
&quot; if you want to display a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window display , then the image is saved , then the image will be saved and s@@ ley ? en leads to a desc@@ end and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the equ@@ ator dialog box will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , in front of the storing . in this case the option does not want to display a preview display . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; pictures saves them . dialog to Save for each image open the dialog box prior to each image , then you need to save the dialog with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save saving without having a fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option save without a fil@@ ename , then this folder will be saved as standard for storing and saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images , and moreover the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image will get a numerical suff@@ ix of every time when a picture is stored . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
&quot; the user can customize the image quality used for saving image quality . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button aid starts the KDE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; the button About starts the KDE About dialog for &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and shots can be used to finish &amp; sc@@ an@@ ite ;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; is licensed under the GPL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; used under L@@ GPL . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GPL with an exception . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these cuts and function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can set up you by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set your mouse button in the player window and select a short command line ... &quot;
you may need to create existing multimedia keys so that they function as a &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; thus making your keyboard to the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Am@@ aro@@ k has many general features that can mostly be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function pause might be like this : &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Am@@ aro@@ k has some own command @-@ lines .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed on account of a missing dependency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog so that the user is not running , why a script does not work . &quot;
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ depres@@ sed v@@ 3.4 is to for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Am@@ aro@@ k and Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to any KDE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the run of external programs and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) used . this way the function ex@@ ec &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends al@@ erts on all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts have to be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events even if there is no use for this . &quot;
configure indicates the script to view the dialog dialog . to save the storing and loading of furniture data each script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now apply now &amp; eg ; with D@@ COP functions additional information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the quantities ) .
volum@@ et@@ ric new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ izing : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le , ab@@ ed the path to selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu item can be identified . to add an entry to remove d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script re@@ mov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example . for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ ks script administration can also install script packages , which can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal tar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so the user can recognize the archive clearly as Am@@ aro@@ k script . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script @-@ packages with the extension of amar@@ ine script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right straight . &quot;
the main thing has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) to get the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the tar parameter to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready you can re@@ charge it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ script page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; apply for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; script running .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; and Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful functions and still is surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of need to work through endless menus . perhaps you are only looking for a very specific titles from thousands of items in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you will find collecting browsers and quick search for you to find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists is still hard for you . and if the decision still falls heavily , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k has excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used to look like your music . these and still many other useful features make Am@@ aro@@ k to the advanced audio player . Am@@ aro@@ k is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the basic folder of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when compile any difficulties . in case you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has like most applications some options that can activate or disable the comp@@ iling point with the configure script , this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort into the dialog dialog . the furnishing dialog has several cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to a playlist or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed ( J@@ K ) . &quot;
&quot; mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . the option turns the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; setting up : this function is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . this will be the used colour scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
voting files at the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k has been compiled . if this setting is activated .@@ on files at the memory location of the respective music files . otherwise the .@@ on files are stored in the Settings folder by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k will be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to any other browser , which is not included in the list . &quot;
&quot; to store the file , the current playlist automatically saves you with the loading of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while you do not want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this attitude , the Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
&quot; current pieces can hold visible in the piece @-@ change , that the play@@ lists window will appear , to keep the current play always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing in to the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section image of appearance you can customize &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts sub@@ part .
&quot; in the fonts section you can choose the use of different fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; use Mark@@ ing of Self fonts . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . click Sel@@ ects ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom colour scheme , you even have the tor@@ ment of choice and can choose your own color scheme . do not use the included colour selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start re@@ moves the playback automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped in the final completion . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display gives you the inser@@ tion of the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D display and you can view the effects of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Sel@@ ection ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross @-@ box shade brings that the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
own colors use gives you the possibility to customize the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . a click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if individual colors will not be activated , the presented &amp; col@@ der colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text indicates the text shown in the OS@@ D . through the type of space the OS@@ D can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available book@@ ke@@ eper and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment will be released .
the card audio output lets you select an audio @-@ driver from the selection box . some drivers activate even further settings in this box card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the folder &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . in order to include a folder into the collection , select the cross @-@ box next to its name . this section also contains cross @-@ cross@@ roads to sub@@ set how with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders re@@ sively browse : this means that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to search for music is well .
&quot; changes : enabled &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( such as music files added or deleted ) , a incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collecting folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection add . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
the part collection database is used to choose a database for the collection . the com@@ bin@@ ational field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected is still necessary for additional equipment in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l establishment .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l unit is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used under machine : the machine is entered under port : the network port , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
user name : and password : to enter the data for the connection to the database .
the card load pay@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it to transmit it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters retrieve : after activation of this attitude will be retrieve &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to be viewed in the context @-@ browser . note : you need not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Am@@ aro@@ k only needs the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including those included in it ) because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; we have written a small guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D ple@@ dges that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ et@@ op@@ .org , for example , we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these constitute an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will bring an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can watch the file by typing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this error on the cr@@ ashing developer . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; mostly , this is due to cr@@ ashes when reading the Meta @-@ Infos from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try out SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of them were compiled by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if such as Am@@ aro@@ k ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machine . off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically opening at a crash ) . if it is a common turn , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data is written as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to the Meta @-@ Infos , but they do not identify as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) look at KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , this is a well @-@ known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a icon until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . you can check if Am@@ aro@@ k the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the right version first . &quot;
there are several ways . most installation problems clarify the easiest by using an expert your UNI@@ X@@ - or Linux @-@ distribution . you can also use help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if you &apos;re talking about the removal of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; there is only a blank playlist . how can there be music tracks there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to hold the surface intuitive to keep the start sub@@ window into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under extras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist . click on the Tit@@ ell@@ ei@@ ste of the playlist and select column display rating . you can also use the short command line Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press de@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and select from playlist removed from the folding menu .
drag a play@@ lists file with your mouse into the playlist and let it fall there exactly as you would make it with other files . so easy it is : - )
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to adding button , there is the button playlist to save . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides you find it on the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which gives you no MP3 decoder in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , entrance fee &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
&quot; if you use the link @-@ driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device needs to use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be achieved through a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa . take a look at the assistance D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the output of this instruction should help you to find the problem of problem and a solution . for you , you may need to indicate a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ way ) . &quot;
&quot; that does &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; already . do not forget that media will need to be de@@ co@@ ded at AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just listen to a white smoke . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you want a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer are the file , de@@ codi@@ le it and sends the PC@@ M @-@ data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codi@@ des data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be printed directly to AL@@ SA , just as well as X@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound@@ server with maximum possible priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper is set : &quot;
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause st@@ amped reproduction . read this error report . the enlar@@ ging of the Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA furnishing file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the faster Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the X@@ ine @-@ driver was heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less jobs respond to visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; stretching is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , cr@@ ashes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; off . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . run G@@ ST @-@ register to register all gen@@ ders .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Am@@ aro@@ k beforehand ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg to compile and install it . then tick the module folder by G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register . start now &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; please note that if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send them the best to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike classic field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
thanks to D@@ COP this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let you execute the alarm on this command : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have aroused the gentle killing of the music that you are stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can you experience current titles in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ongoing titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH surroundings exists , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and titles of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ use --@@ user @-@ user name Am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa is present .
&quot; the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changing window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ els + rights mouse button puts a piece in the air order in the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search have reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does it see the icon in the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting from Am@@ aro@@ k the collection database cannot be created and on the console has many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ k@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; put the CD a , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal read , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a context window . for automatic code , you instead take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add the review for a piece by yourself by clicking on a sp@@ readsheet in the play@@ lists in the play@@ lists . then you can select the rating of a piece , as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and edit : rating , or change F@@ 2 . you can edit the rating also in the dialog metadata . &quot;
the developers do not want to present you when you are to publish a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : KDE packages have a specified release plan which is not connected to the short term plan of Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; this is a new function in Am@@ aro@@ k , but some users can easily find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the general settings . &quot;

&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , then please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus a lot of error reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k has been compiled before you have installed X@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules appear still not . and now ? &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer c@@ vel . you need to install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re @-@ compile and install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to re @-@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ den@@ &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ thinking , which is incompatible with G@@ stre@@ amer . you need to compile gen@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ thinking . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : use no LD@@ FLA@@ GS when you compile Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ingly au@@ dia / MP4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer are installed .
&quot; to be able to play MP4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with g@@ ams , needs to be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ ic audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Am@@ aro@@ k use the second sound card ?
among settings Am@@ aro@@ k set up ... audio output type the device . typical is Z. B. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ int@@ el 8@@ x@@ 0 { type C@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b audio audio { type 6@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type 6@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b audio audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter in the furnishing dialog by X@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib will take care of the conversion of the ta@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual mix device , you can de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may of course take this problem to yourself ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the furnishing assist@@ ants who would like to update your collection , or the assist@@ ants simply do not like it , then you will have this quick start @-@ guide . with their help you will have set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you will have set up in a few minutes . &quot;

&quot; the playlist of Am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that exist in no other player , but let &apos;s not be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right side you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use , yet even for advanced users performance strong enough . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current volume . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ window : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub@@ window will later be more detail . &quot;
if you &apos;ve already used earlier versions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; perhaps you might think that the sub@@ window will be taken away . the information presented there are now available in other parts of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; they can also be collected in the statistical window ( Extras Statis@@ tics ) .
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the album , performer and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to detect the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find further information on the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its review . &quot;
&quot; to show cover images in the context browser , the cover images are displayed in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are being preferred . the images can also display Cover pictures , which are either downloaded with the Cover administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately be played . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information in the music box will be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of interpre@@ ter , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ters that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to immediately start playing . you can also click with the right mouse button and then select one of the possibilities for adding the piece or album to playlist .

&quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the changed version is then stored in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database is necessary . &quot;
the button Brow@@ se opens a search on google@@ .com to the Li@@ ed@@ text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ter - grouped only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / album - first , the pieces will be arranged according to interpre@@ ters , and among them , another division would like to see according to the respective album . if you want to see together or sound@@ track records , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / year - album - Sor@@ ted by interpre@@ ter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ Name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them according to interpre@@ ter .

&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing entirely to popularity and combine . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically detect your collection automatically when you own something at selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; right under the toolbar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the building view . references to the use of this Fil@@ ters can be found in the section to playlist in this handbook . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . besides , you can of course also select your total collection , making the filter virtually off . &quot;
by clicking with the right mouse button on one entry in the browser browser you will receive the following possibilities .
&quot; loading - This is the current playlist , and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback . &quot;
&quot; to playlist , Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you reach the same effect . &quot;

&quot; compilation markings - change as a compilation album back into a normal album , but the album is not displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the associated interpre@@ ter . &quot;
the play@@ lists browser establishes the handling of many play@@ lists very simple . among other things he also contains Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
&quot; the lower part of the play@@ lists , contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of : &quot;
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even the Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new intelligence playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , it is possible to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you must find the pieces on your iPod by interpre@@ ter in the upper list of media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and leave them on the list interpre@@ ters . therefore , the pieces will be loaded onto your iPod . if the transmission is finished , finish &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; and release the disk connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar is a search area , with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list , all the files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser you will find address bar , with which you can fetch music from an appropriate URL . if you enter e.g. tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz and lets you access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window is , the hang of files can be difficult by simply par@@ ach@@ ute . in the case , the fet@@ ters of Shift key may be helpful : thereby random files will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mas@@ onry . &quot;
&quot; the playlist accounts all of you to play an@@ gled pieces . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter , you press as long as the back@@ light , until the text@@ box is again empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by space separate seekers , will enter &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all the search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all the entries , one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; if you enter between the search terms , it is sought after entries that either contain either one or the other search . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all the pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries , the spaces contain , then close the key@@ word with go@@ ose : Mike classic field . thus , after entries , Mike classic field is included , not yet according to entries such as Mike J. vintage field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search @-@ old , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for one piece , which did not contain a certain search term , make a minus sign in front of the search : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syn@@ tac@@ variants for popularity with each other . example : Mike classic field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all the pieces that either Mike classic field , or a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment . &quot;
you can set the playback sequence of entries by pressing the string button and then click with the right mouse button on the desired order . the entries then get a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you find the button Add , with which you can add the playlist . right next to it , you can find playlist , empty and random con@@ ical . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons are revers@@ ed and re @-@ establish . this allows you to un@@ lock changes to the playlist or restore . &quot;

trans@@ code : a command line program for the video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped author system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and Super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adapt the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating selected CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 Coll@@ ections can be useful for example , without norm@@ alize the different entrance levels of the various albums to the in@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be reproduced differently loud . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically show all videos on the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise will be asked for a new fil@@ ename . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . KDE &apos;s dialog box is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
stores all the open projects . that &apos;s the same if you would like to save for every single project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has changed and still not saved , queries &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then pause between saving and changes . besides , you can then break the shot and keep the project so opened . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project , which is supposed to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opening projects and ended &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what to happen , as if you were called a file . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select through the authorized dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you want to move the files directly from the top view into the project view , the files appear in the basic folder on the CD . &quot;
&quot; open dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics @-@ dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the right mouse button ( reachable via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes me to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you if this function is not used for you to see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is proposed to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removed no files from the medium , it only ends the imported files again . &quot;
&quot; open the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this allows you to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can only copy a copy of a CD instead of normal cop@@ iers . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD Copy dialog . this allows you to create a DVD on another medium . alternatively , there is also the possibility of a DVD instead of normal cop@@ iers . besides , there is also the possibility of a DVD using the copying dialog , therefore , the target medium must be big enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previously released CD @-@ screen . the dialog is asked for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ zip or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously released DVD @-@ screen . the dialog is asking for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the kil@@ ns button . &quot;
&quot; a previous DVD video can be converted . thereby it helps you use this dialog window . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but it also contains information about the aus@@ ed video , enco@@ ding settings and even options to change the size and to cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasional medium . this information is displayed in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is marked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this crosses , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; set the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the view is enabled , the content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , lock and un@@ lock the disk or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; turns the table view , or off . the table view enables the dial and pulling of files in the project view . the table view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; switches the header line in the rear view or out . the header bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that contains only visible if the proj@@ ector has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the keyboard regulations for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the buttons to it further down . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishing assist@@ ants . thus , the right per@@ missions to set to burning CDs and DVDs are required , therefore , you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should function in An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to the fine tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , therefore , is rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive in which the attached programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then , enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program painted , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ aux D@@ v@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ aux D@@ v@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro DV@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) is form@@ at@@ re@@ f ( ) to Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ f ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) in bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ COP reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will receive using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@
K@@ 3@@ b provides the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; read with it simply audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on En@@ coder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are enco@@ ded to WAV files ( compressed comp@@ compression ) default ( these co@@ ders can still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) compressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ an ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders are already installed , so it is most likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the codi@@ fied packages need not be used . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; what code format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ effici@@ ents , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the audio CD ; if not the mechanisms of cop@@ iers are not possible . avoid using the copying audio CD ; simply avoid the purchase of the copying audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup needs to be made only once ( the furnishing dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , then the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding the slim approach of the user interface , over which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can get &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without a network where everything is manually collected .
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , there are further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB inquiry is launching the CD@@ DB data according to the installation of request in the CD@@ DB database . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder has been configured in the Device Management tab - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder so that the choice with a different en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that before the en@@ coder has been configured in the Device dialog box .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and enco@@ ding .
opens the furnishing dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programme events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; terminated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cards cards ( such as En@@ coder , to setup the enco@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compres@@ sive rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; in audio formats , MP3 and O@@ GG lose the most common . O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ ders are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , compared with O@@ GG , compared to lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices exist .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer greater transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has very high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rates up to 6.3 kb@@ ps and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compres@@ sive rate approximately 5.5 . needs more 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo system with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compres@@ sive rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . well enough for music of young people , portable devices and car facilities . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &quot; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be manually entered by the program from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder name and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of programmes for co@@ ders and those parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people download the audio CDs that can be downloaded , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m . the author meant ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so can neither the artist nor the music company may be attached . all information can be obtained from any bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; shop , physically , or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active a cross @-@ crossing ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB may not be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used by calling the data from the server ( This may only be the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphically will be used on the next panel . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online call of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which expression program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see To be aware that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this has not yet been done .
&quot; for storing the illuminated WAV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be chosen . when opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ ding package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ ding can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device drawing of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to indicate both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check whether you don &apos;t want to read a copy audio CD ; read the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step by step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , not a problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be installed as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not considered to be completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files as you can naturally always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own scre@@ aming to copy it ( eg by trying to copy it with the quer@@ or somewhat ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic draft of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is likely to be done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any reco@@ ver@@ sive &amp; CD ;
&quot; here we determine the type of enco@@ ders for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with the free@@ DB information to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read it on any read of a &amp; CD ; change when the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device drawing is handed over to the reader program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently is / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link on the real device drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive is available , this can also help the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card card General settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion is defined . in our example everything will be as at@@ tainable / entered as shown in the screenshot .
&quot; only in case of un@@ full information can be requested , so that you will be informed if data are missing from sampling ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to download automatically via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the file name / fil@@ ename or day entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or file name is changed with Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example is further to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , then disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is worth 620 MB to use this twice . however , this about 620 MB to use , you must have selected the two choices , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how do the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screenshot is pictured . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this road the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function works even@@ ly as to the server , but there are many fire@@ walls the protocol 8@@ 80 default , there is more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be dis@@ abling .
simply take the settings from the screenshot now . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously permissible pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es Read and co@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are to cross this tigh@@ ten , then / folder must be specified when only space on another drive is available . this folder can not be noted , the files in the private folder will not be created , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything just enter as it is on the screenshot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances something must be blow@@ n to the right . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the achieved bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; the number of simultaneously co@@ ding WAV files : if a du@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is what we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any read of a &amp; CD ; used if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is structured , as we want to be comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for any reco@@ ver@@ sive &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use that is not included in free@@ DB , the screen@@ caps are a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually entered into account , instead of picking them out of the internet . comments are to be found on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length are listed in the window , as in the screenshot now . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; it could be identified and be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers concerning the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been retri@@ eved from the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out , and the name of the artist and album are also displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window built in the database , and you can select the database entry in which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but need the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - enter the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; latest titles &apos; to read the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Update titles &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ pped per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so you can not only start with the Arti@@ sts and Album @-@ names ( e.g. if all words are beginning with big letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this option is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have an unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allows you to have a look in the tab &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the day @-@ information of the generated files later on any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the codi@@ le to find more information .
just choose an entry which obviously matches the style of the fav@@ oured CD ; in this example this is not important as we do the CD ; data anyway . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will be back and you see , that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the item &apos;s name for each case and other information that you want . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you entered all the track data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . please note that the artist and the album are displayed on the front list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ character before each line of a piece . only the titles which are selected are selected , or simply click the button Select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button of clicking the read @-@ out process , this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders to turn on the order window . it is in the upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window for control of orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you &apos;re trying to work with a co@@ ater that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and enco@@ ding parallel . take note of the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration adjustment to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . at high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and co@@ ding ( of course two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded , and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fication of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is now maintained within the &amp; D ; CV@@ S is part of the k@@ dem@@ on package . however , you can download an anonymous copy , since &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package of your distribution . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , as the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different other programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading this ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the first time of the program@@ ing , without any clu@@ e as it will proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when at the time of program boot no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what about it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like that :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a handbook to &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you always want to do something use@@ full or change it , may it do . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely if we have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need that information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke Bar of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others he did not have some properties that have other &amp; UNIX all the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; D ; support function . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultra @-@ project distributor , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it is a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the light text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel due to high@@ lighting of the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to go to K@@ Mid .
&quot; supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song@@ writers , or text events ) . &quot;
&quot; support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; during the playback of a song , the mid next time starts again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ Syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also functions with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playback in the toolbar , select the entry subscription from the menu item or pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played afterwards . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece happens , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and proceed with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song gets too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the temp@@ o display and thus change the playback speed . to re @-@ click the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the spac@@ eb@@ ar appears like a pressure on the button of break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so breaks the playback . pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; reproduction . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use textures , others use Li@@ ed@@ t@@ resp@@ ite , and again some both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; mid @-@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , that you have nothing to adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu settings , the entries text files or songs . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . these are the row being played . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
to put a collection at first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then indicate the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the lo@@ osing in collecting managers . &quot;
the temporary collection comes across all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concern yourself if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting managers . there you can add a song using the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setup automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and it is activated . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click away . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the sequence after from the sub@@ menu playback of the menu collections , the songs are played in the sequence , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in collecting manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to continue to jump a song , select the &apos; Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; around the reverse a song back to jump , select the button preceding pieces , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI @-@ Events in Events , which sees the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all the events of the Change Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always can sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all required re@@ compositions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . a prerequisite for this is , however , that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as email , so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
this section is given as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ itable sign will be ignored . it is believed that the GM patches in the correct order occur ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also have no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all sounds which support this instrument ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which allows you to use the same in PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( tissue signal ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that in case with the term drum patch the patch is designed , with which every tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ment ( drums , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one , in which the tone means the sound height of the always same drum ( how to possess some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify as tones on a particular channel or instrument .
&quot; as with PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P Section the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ boards for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are needed above all to counter tones on the Per@@ k@@ conversation channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ boards .
&quot; this section can be used to change some channels on others . if you want to s@@ wap for example the first and second channel , simply make it simple in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section so has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is used on the Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally be defined in the file ! if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case the patch is used always patch x . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the be@@ k patch on the per@@ k@@ conversation channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio is to be multiplied , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event is calculated with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file is not dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal number ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard that will play a pitch , which will play a pitch with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try to try some key@@ boards up to an oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole host of pi@@ ons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ ws you see , which sounds are being played straight . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the split sounds . view settings in the menu Settings under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the larger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI @-@ file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I cannot force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compres@@ sion@@ ing ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; no A@@ we support has been compiled . to remove the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; do not agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , activate the setup automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow keys left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or clicked on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will add to temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. , first you only want to play the first file . so adjust the setting automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ D. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then , close yourself to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thanks again ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , animated me this , continue to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I &apos;m not much free time to take my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try programming , MIDI files , music and propositions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ pad .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really want to send me a huge hope when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me if I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written completely in my spare time and read by anyone for money . I want to emphasize that I just write about it , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

&quot; additionally this can be &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ pad .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can find the development , find information and look at . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you with a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or an A@@ we card . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files of M@@ Player or ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playing DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet over &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .

the application window is formed from so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that only appears if information is displayed in it .
&quot; it is possible to choose the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which will be played after each other , so you should use the category of thumb@@ playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub@@ categories are copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ ence playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; however , the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , may choose from the menu view , and as next editing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after the changing of XML files , you have to choose from the menu retri@@ eved from the menu and select either the processing mode , or a different category . &quot;
&quot; all changes go lost , when the processing mode exit or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during start@@ up and finish can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ x / k@@ m@@ player / ec@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start@@ up does not need to be short , it will be terminated automatically by opening another source . this would be disturbing the end @-@ animation , however , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite photos . &quot; &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; &quot; : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f . &quot; &quot; sr@@ c / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; ; / Import@@ ant ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &quot;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate reservoir size from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&quot; Flash &quot; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can reproduce the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type alpha / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishing dialog box of KDE can be specified .
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error regarding loading the browser module library . the stolen process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end is taken for a particular m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on can reproduce all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used by TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; to set up the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box is used in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports of which a selected co@@ ding must be found ( e.g. is it PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR can use support for k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video ( probably this type of playback of video devices to Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be working for the X server ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; now internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , tru@@ source , lack source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing with the playback of the playlist . &quot;
is there advice on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive le@@ iser when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root to execute using the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine only starts slowly but why do my CPU needs to be tested on their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional document application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably attacked on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution will be included . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation is taken into account . however , the support of this project or its documentation is required , the contact should be made via the ki@@ le ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le , on or become an expan@@ sions , this should be addressed at the mailing list box @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; D . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to know more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities should learn the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the right instructor : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . w@@ elling the ur@@ ring ( English . lay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is , can also use a less demanding but more realistic analysis is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here only a good idea to &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to place . to be able to control &amp; l@@ atex ; a guide to &amp; l@@ atex , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd edition , 1999 ) . &quot;
&quot; just like other say@@ ings , includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction to be defined with the general characteristics of paper @-@ format , side numbered , and text size , which begins with the command \ \ Start { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ using { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is an effective function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( menu ) can also be done some of the settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of the document may be collected : articles ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , project ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
enco@@ ding : hereby the string enco@@ ding is set . it should use the enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for the integration , they are only cleaned in the cross @-@ cross@@ roads . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN @-@ regulations ) . &quot;
new users now have no worries to worry about . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; it will not happen by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is saving you by the high@@ lighting time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic gener@@ aliz@@ ations of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin with { command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the app@@ end@@ ent line to close the command ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; let the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most subtle and subtle element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure of the structure the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective switch .
&quot; when creating the own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex file . once a DVI file has been created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding row in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI file contained a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and upri@@ ghtness . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ored search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file is pped with the editor , and once upon an element in the DVI ; source code is fed , becomes the corresponding contrary . once upon a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is fed , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI and viewer . &quot;
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project may be set a project @-@ wide master document to project project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode the DVI @-@ file is provided on the br@@ other@@ hoods . there will be no call from &amp; oc@@ ular ; after quick @-@ construction .
&quot; with regard to the editing toolbar , the three large types of joint elements should be stri@@ pped up . the selection fields were designed for fast mounting of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The commands are for the sub@@ division : &quot;
&quot; the selection field more is for starting articles such as tags , joints or references . &quot;
name : using this command a term for a section is created an image or different element .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selecting a selection field ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; these files are corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b . the author is able to place good experience with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the final selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¼ e is used for the definition of the font . it is able to set the font , the main text , the joints , etc . there are the following fonts . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand on hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ Docum@@ entary class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the font . if the font is not at the beginning , this can also be pointed out in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code was entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to this is the use of the frame construction or a button @-@ fast . &quot;
the source code must be stored in front of comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document errors , should be sought in the logging after errors . when using rapid construction , &amp; oc@@ ular ; this is not the case , should also be considered the logging . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text , which is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font is created 12 and only a few sentences . the command \ &apos; begin { environment } , \ \ Be@@ fore { environment } , \ \ Be@@ fore { environment } . &quot;
the funds will only be cau@@ tious within the area ( from \ \ &apos; begin { environment } until \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction in an environment .
&quot; there are many options to listen to the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fats , cou@@ pl@@ ings , cou@@ pl@@ ings , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ &apos; begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quotation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source texts with the &amp; l@@ atex ; output language , now follows a step by step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the wizard has been entered a bit text , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . there@@ for a quotation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem is used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can return to the editor ( with the internal observer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simple try and fun . &quot;
DVI ; is a low file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ conversion or computer screen . &quot;
for the print of a &amp; DVI file are the same steps as for the creation of the document nÃ © ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using the print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
&quot; the toolbar icons lets the conversion of the DVI , file into other formats . once the DVI file was created from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion into st@@ acked other formats by means of the kno@@ ck in the toolbar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search search is the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . this requires only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le set up ... Tools Construction finishes .
&quot; to re@@ ate the pre @-@ search search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and should be attached to pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer is then made . &quot;
this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; it must be set in &amp; oc@@ ular ; used as text editor ; settings Ok@@ ular@@ line ( Settings Ok@@ ular@@ line ... Editor )
&quot; if using rapid construction of the &amp; DVI to the viewer , an error can occur . should an error be presented , this is shown in the log file or in the message window in summary . &quot;
&quot; the protocol of the log file may be used in the source code . in the editor , the log file can always be used in the error . the log file always indicates the error in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , it must be attached to the defect in the logging line and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once it is connected to the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . &quot;
&quot; if you choose a document , a document can either be re@@ written or used for quick creation of a new document . for more information on this document are included in the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . assists you can in &amp; ki@@ le , created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; it can be created or create a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or string enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in settings box ... settings General . &quot;
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ entation class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and in order to inform the commands of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps were accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be displayed instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps below are introduced . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the mot@@ ility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be done directly from &amp; ki@@ le .
to know more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its options should be drawn to K@@ ate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can place there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called for the help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ clicking with dr@@ unken string button , around the &amp; tex ; -@@ word exp@@ ose . that means that in this way , the clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ &quot; &quot; only \ \ \ &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can choose parts of the source code in the Edi@@ tor@@ window . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the ability to browse the most different types of source texts and emphas@@ ise them . for example the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
&quot; there are many assist@@ ants to place additional jumping marks . here , it is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu attached the jump to the nÃ ¼ or last jump . thereby , this spr@@ ite stamp will also be highlighted , so that it is automatically assigned to the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate ; important functions are added to writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for the writing of a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands are included in the text code : &quot;
&quot; hide a complete paragraph ( group of rows , contained on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph does not include tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only pointed thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore that the check out by two blank lines are separated . &quot;
&quot; choose the word below the current cursor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with a range of space ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to stop a part of the document can be out of this first , and by Dr@@ inks , the key line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; with its own commands , the following commands may contain for a faster mix . &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description about editing paragraph .
&quot; it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le offers more commands under editing environment for an excellent work with &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
this command is p@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to exchange the surrounding area .
this command is p@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the area .
&quot; if the cursor is in front or within the command \ \ &apos; begin to { environment } , the end of the environment is j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; during the entry of many spar@@ ed ambient commands may soon be lost during this command . this command slept very much the most recently renovated environment , so that the spar@@ red ambient structure is not an atom@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands , which correspond to the nearby surroundings . &quot;
this command is used to start the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cl@@ ums@@ y cl@@ amp .
with this command to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the failed cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is before or behind the curved cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; during the entry of many spar@@ ed groups @-@ brackets can be quickly lost during the final view . this command slept very last , so that the wi@@ ped structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used two simple beginn@@ er characters as a gift voucher ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple beginn@@ er characters . also for the end of the beginning , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this automatic starting point of the double beginn@@ er marks can set up under Settings Ki@@ le , ... La@@ Te@@ X and be eliminated . &quot;
you can also use case @-@ specific settings ( such as German or French ) and thus German or French starting point . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; with the view of Shift ; input @-@ down &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent code enum@@ eration , if the current position inside a lists - environment ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables environment I slept &amp; ki@@ le , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a tigh@@ tening setting . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments in favor . this enables you to place among settings ti@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users need to arrange columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all the em@@ t signs ( amp ; ) ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; according to the appropriate tab@@ ulator in the following line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the per@@ verse , for the columns position the current tab@@ s . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code , this was installed in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( usually more for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are three according to need and the other two are for automatic finishing . all these modes can be set for different working methods among settings Ki@@ le set ... &quot;
&quot; in the beginning a new setting by using the command \ \ &apos; begin { environment } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ flex , the last letter is removed from input , and this enables the complete list of payment . on the other hand , the list can also be res@@ ized by entering another letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively you can jump into these positions using the Edit jumping cursor . &quot;
under Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be done to these lists . it enables you to choose different kinds of things for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands as well as alarm commands from general language use .
&quot; the command mode is for the complete payment of environments not needed , and the call of the default mode will have a rough list with ambient mode . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the perpet@@ uation of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; button or but@@ ton@@ ic spac@@ eb@@ ar mode , the command is automatically folded and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient humidity is resum@@ ed in the easiest way and by the input of the input key . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le re@@ alizes that it is a lists environment , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of pre@@ payment mode for a &amp; b ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supporting user @-@ defined lists of spac@@ ers , which are instantly replaced by default strings . the lists can be set under Settings Ki@@ le set ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ complete list , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X file is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word inst@@ alls Cor@@ n + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; big che@@ ek@@ ers are not helpful for automatic finishing . however , it has been noted that many names are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le offers all written documents already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ voll@@ mächti@@ gter . &quot; here , the swelling can also be determined by the display of the payment . &quot;
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / / / mode / of the Persian Home folder .
&quot; the dialog diagrams form the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to exchange views of the bases on the graphics formats , the sections and notice should be observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for any changes and re@@ fr@@ actions of pages . will the PDF output can be arranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to place the result of the work you need to be compiled , the source code must be compiled into the men@@ tion@@ ist creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer like &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further conversion , the keyboard file can be used in default , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the instruction manual construction , a spect@@ ator is called after comp@@ iling . should not be used any built @-@ in viewer , every new window will appear . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project &apos;s new project .... here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when using the file name , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the output of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical gro@@ wer .
the API scripts have not yet been developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ;
&quot; first , you must be said that the application environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a systematic object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a quite small system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . in this , a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; l@@ atex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; a complete lecture ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands may contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as a real help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied documents and here for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . by &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are shown .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the bed space provided the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ ist and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source code ; is suitable for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix systems . &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project . &amp; ki@@ le ; is also available on &amp; Mac ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X .
&quot; much thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continuation of the &amp; ki@@ le ; the project is striving for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license will be able to use . up @-@ to @-@ date information about the contribut@@ ors are available in the menu . &quot;

&quot; each one who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is familiar , I know it a piece , we give it a graphical surface ! no more on a terminal device ; simply click on a terminal device ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor . &quot;
&quot; this application is expecting a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the folder , then leave the current desktop folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ stations and enter the folder you folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time you mean pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; when the straight opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply let the current desktop folder chosen . if not , then select it up to date and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on the screen , their file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y , then leave the current file easy to act . if not , delete them at current file the tick and select the file to be tested by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they just want to know if the file well @-@ being is , they click the Well @-@ wide review selection . &quot;
&quot; use one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that is stated in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( external ) and give it the place of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( external ) and for the Relax@@ NG verification is required by providing the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
Ja@@ probably , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tools ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file has been selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; it is already marked , then leave the current file simply chosen . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file id file using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; insert the name of the file , as the result is to be named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; even having little to do . thus , the plugin system is very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and need not wait until someone can use the lo@@ osing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ise ; it is possible to use the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more elements can be used below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we begin with the plug @-@ ins plug @-@ in . thus the following dialog is opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all of the plugins and add new plugins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ Element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location is used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often , working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tos ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project like both team and sub@@ project leader .
&quot; the user can look for himself from the list of members who he is . this happens when he searches the team member from the list and set the button as pressing . currently , the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ name and setting of one &apos;s own identity is important regarding messages and comments . see for further information on remarks .
beside the overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : there may be an event for information to the team leader when something happens . see in for more information .
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something particular is happening in the project . an example would be a sign of opening and closing the project so that later a file is saved , or a script , when a file is saved into the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event of event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
a mail will be sent to the addres@@ see of the addres@@ see list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see how such conductors will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes is simple . it can be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by dra@@ fted text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the nick@@ name of the team member is to be played a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager sub@@ project leader After the departments and sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding departments or sub@@ project names , as stated in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ sp@@ elling , but space for brackets and : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages ; the D@@ T@@ D @-@ agn@@ os@@ tic is and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , just about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... this dialog covers some pages that will be treated in one another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; regarding tags including car completes can be changed . the entries are :
large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling of tags : big / Klein@@ sch@@ elling of automatically inserted tags . normal great / to@@ kens means the tags are inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling of attributes : large / Klein@@ sch@@ elling of automatically assigned attributes . normal great / to@@ kens means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
&quot; optional tags automatically shut : if you go , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after reading ; inserted . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
&quot; start@@ up and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day is also subject to change and vice versa . &quot;
automatic shut@@ ters of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ak@@ cent@@ u@@ ated characters into the appropriate enco@@ ding during the intru@@ sion .
M@@ IM@@ E types : facial types for the detection of different types of files . using the default file default file can be restored .
default code enco@@ ding : enco@@ ding of newly created or in another way than with file open @-@ open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed over ) but this setting here is loaded from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is displayed by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ise ; compiled regularly backup copies , so that at a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents a backup is updated regularly , according to the time issued . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings back at the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views marked by each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ op command line parameters .
the warning messages area serves the taxes of the possibility to re @-@ turn the display of war@@ nings by no longer .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in the shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and structural tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , to be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree causes the following action , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the area of struc@@ turing settings , the visibility of knots in the tree can be opened automatically when machining and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be adjusted automatically . empty No@@ des are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are those that were not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for the fixing of abbreviations ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded when editing to a comprehensive text . this means that it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ pro@@ strate means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins are managed . plugins are K@@ part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re @-@ used by each K@@ part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ ins must be stated : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it is possible to open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode download : check whether the plugin is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; checked the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; whether the entered information is correct . it allows the storing of the entry also if the plugin is not available at the moment but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; as of version 3.3 , the debu@@ gging has been completely newly developed . seal support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been implemented , as well as the support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead of which a debu@@ gger plugin has been implemented , the different implem@@ ent@@ ations of plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ire ; inserts . &quot;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the debu@@ gger plugin system the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; when a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; interface : &quot;
a view which is displayed in the contents of supervised variables . usually appears in the left @-@ hand dock .
&quot; a view , in which all semi @-@ points are listed , with row numbers and conditions are listed . usually in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is usually shown in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
&quot; with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger is needed , or she shares the plugin with , to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan &apos;s demands . this action is opened by default if a project is opened , so that a debu@@ gger does not need to be respected . &quot;
the object of debu@@ gging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or ends the foli@@ age to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the debu@@ gger edition .
&quot; indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to begin and information on the supervised variables as well as the currently exec@@ uting line continuously . when this happens during the script is continued , the execution is continued before a debit requirement was started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; pointing the debu@@ gger to send the execution of the script to send without information to over@@ surveillance variables and the current Z@@ eil@@ ing Number . if this happens during a script , the execution is given , the execution starts once a requirement is placed . &quot;
the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without having to enter into the functions or include include .
&quot; the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , using if possible in functions and include error . &quot;
&quot; indicates the debu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next one , as if there were the current not . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ to , adapt to your needs and how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; help better to get better . &quot;
&quot; documentation of Edi@@ table pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ways ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scripts , as well as CSS @-@ trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web development , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the two languages respectively &amp; CSS ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the toolbar . day toolbar ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , include text and instructions faster in a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work@@ pieces . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and the content of the individual design , the &amp; qu@@ ann@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . factory toolbar enable quick inser@@ ting tags into a document without a danger of writing . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day XML files . day folder carry the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ based ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML to and de@@ pl@@ ari@@ ed whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are set forth in a simple way .
this is the root element of a day document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains as only one element type above itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type Meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method is owned . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a new attribute @-@ attribute , and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt : text &gt; -@@ day . that &apos;s an only element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only be determined once for each attribute . additionally , there are other tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element element . &quot;
prints the source code for the attributes used in the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface board and a method name . the arguments to pass to the method can be empty or % tag@@ on % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that grouped the elements of a list together . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
defines the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur for every attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is an only element type .
provides a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration begin : ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly sto@@ cked and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; b &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ways ; to start the window and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available yet . at present the review only takes place when loading c@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ew .
&quot; in the following an example of a family 1 day of XML file . this file describes it , schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this day @-@ XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP file will be described . the fil@@ ename of this day @-@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Sundays &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; re@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is a editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D @-@ specification . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... click on New Promotion leads to the same dialogue :
this action weigh@@ ted keyboard short@@ cuts . with clicking the button user interface can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with a one is the current keyboard short@@ cuts .
the simplest actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ector settings and inserted into the text in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , they are the quick@@ start @-@ dialog , or the different Behold in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / scrip@@ ts / scrip@@ ts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / out of the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods a script can be displayed by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ausen ; at the default switch , input can be determined , which is to send to the default transmission . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually recommended only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the performed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue . error messages , on the standard error messages can be specified , which is to be specified by the default output text by which the value is set to the default output output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , that &apos;s why you can create a toolbar with the name of the aw@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you have to add action and configure your actions . choose settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; to edit &quot; &quot; when available , so that an entry in using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ n ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 Pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in view that the day start , I decided to create a push @-@ kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as a symbol , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user can be sign@@ alized ; start@@ up , the tag in the current document will be inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ere ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue them with other tags , so there are still which gives or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; functions to complement the toolbar , or it should adjust it to a better view through some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . make sure that the toolbar toolbar can be selected in multiple groups . make sure that the toolbar toolbar can be selected . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the separ@@ ner ( very left above ) for my toolbar . according to the selection of the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to make a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note how separ@@ ating the group@@ ing support . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new toolbar must be tested by pro@@ bing of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; once new e@@ XML does not exist , there will im@@ stem folder , but your toolbar icons ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please match her &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar ( s ) will be opened ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the worth mentioning extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ew ; check out if anyone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we leave you , the second we treat you here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html page 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html page 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ Script Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
&quot; note the # before the Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess sti@@ ff ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out . &quot;
note that the contents directory is directly refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the man@@ tra &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will appear ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; b &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; Resources files are replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the structure of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of curved context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and in accordance with $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as indicated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are well and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; -@@ repository for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked at the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the sli@@ ce resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ pieces with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different points there is an Email send menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless to release the resources , why there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you will have multiple keys you may disclose your input fields ( URL preview may remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading can be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload the toolbar toolbar and folders in the template and scripts tree in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ise ; the integrity of the resource is war@@ med by checking the integrity and signature . if the integrity given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; it is currently out @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files will be needed in day XML format . there is the simplest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D menu and converting a D@@ T@@ D menu . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialogue appears : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition command : the string presented in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d may appear
&quot; setting up the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; therefore , you have to do so first with these fundament@@ als . this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos : the working area is divided into three sections : global , locally and projection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who is marked as global , and is available as global , is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; stored . this enables the group of administrators to secure different work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; simply said this is most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ola ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the man@@ views , the cards with information and the toolbar . please hit in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the map with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document password , re@@ charge or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ menu in the Edi@@ tor@@ section lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing of the tags under the mouse pointer or opening the file when the string icon under the mouse pointer is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the editing window , the toolbar of the editor will be shown ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of work@@ pieces will be demonstrated . in the course of the further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; the toolbar of the new functions and the associated user needs are adapted . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ pieces is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that has shown the day . now , you can insert the data for this just added day ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; to navigate , to open and to strip . in the display with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , model templates , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like Add , remove , up@@ loading or deletion of files from the storage media can be carried out with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y. the working area is always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information on the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information on a script . via the right mouse button are more functions available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email . &quot;
with this view you see the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of an element of the cursor in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with it can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . based on the content , the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os , one can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and looked at . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the practical information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this map shows information about each in the Qu@@ anta current script , such as the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D . &quot;
&quot; this card leader shows all the errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lo@@ os ; work@@ flows are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate site of the toolbar is the possibility of defining your own prec@@ ep@@ ts as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; sends the toolbar as a comp@@ lied tar archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ways ; as any other guarantee and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ways ; you &apos;ll be able to adjust auto@@ conf file to your system . to get a complete list of options available to configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed . &quot;
if you have problems starting at the start of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH before her own folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos ; has been optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; a peculi@@ ar , expand@@ able market @-@ language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer is limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; therefore far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE should be ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; od@@ ours is not just this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos : how to extend it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and materials . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information about the detailed documentation is available with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; input , or a help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ lu@@ sion@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick preview of files you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file that is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pres@@ et , will only be reported an error . &quot;
conver@@ ts with inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there provided special characters to the &amp; HTML ; writing so that it is displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form@@ atting assignment .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; writing which the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in the URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ tion of &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switch the block@@ ages to or from . this allows you to select text @-@ blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
move directly to a link number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script error messages are out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phrases to help you .
displays the news window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of the problem re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , once you switch to the structural tree . &quot;
displays the toolbar column left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be grouped in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos ; projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in Projects / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar icons : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates just the name . actions must store by settings actions , or you will be asked to store the toolbar of the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; remove a toolbar from the field of view . it does not del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you would like to do that . &quot;
&quot; this way you can send their own toolbar on someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos ; -@@ Team , so that the toolbar icons in the next release is available ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of work@@ pieces on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
&quot; load a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else made others , and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ e ; own description . &quot;
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; is useful when the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , are to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present and a sp@@ elling in the global KDE folder is not available , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar icons , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; the inser@@ tion by means of toolbar icons , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ tac@@ tic mode for the current file . the list of available back@@ packs schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of type identifi@@ er . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D ; using the external application .
&quot; immediate switching between the various types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries , the envelope can sometimes need time or un@@ sigh@@ ted graphics . recommended is the cart@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of an entry the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ew ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog can be used any application which use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which add and the sequences will change .
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the mouse &apos;s environment , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; development in financial form can be found here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed automatically from top to bottom , because after filling out the project name the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server @-@ address of the machine , which you want to access , except you can edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; lets you be empty this field blank , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the settings of the remote host , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the template for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project , multiple files or whole folder can be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great , when you have static web@@ content that you want to download and change . at server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; go @-@ in if files , which are to be mounted somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started on new , not attack . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of th@@ inning . &quot;
&quot; this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by typing , or , by removing the tick , out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project characteristics in the menu window profiles or with the short@@ cuts shift ; F@@ 7 are changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( Plac@@ eholders possible ) that can be re@@ jects with project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supplem@@ ental option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the view , which is loaded when opening the project . in addition , more information can be read about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be set up with the button options . in the debu@@ gger code it is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles can be set ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for each profile by pointing a separate building view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete them . event transactions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced by now . &quot;
to open another project you choose project opening ... from the menu project or the symbol project opening out of the toolbar . the dialogue project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ise ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . there the files in the current project can be managed .
&quot; folders also behave as well , but the entries are missing Open and Open with ... to the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the site of the up@@ loaded files . see .
&quot; remove the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile exists , the button will drop down to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and forget with program@@ ing . this option is useful , if common up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate will not be stored in question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies , many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . if you edit or create a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the Trans@@ fer@@ protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service not to the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be easily read in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and toolbar . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simply diving the view , various files and work@@ pieces can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or project toolbar , accessible or deleted via settings toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; with which one has to do on most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are work@@ pieces in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; best about the menu toolbar designs . use and adding differ . adding work@@ pieces will be treated down in the section Ad@@ ditions of work@@ pieces .
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set out either by means of the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions can be specified on this or other toolbar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , you will additionally remove the entries and perform action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbar and set up actions ..
&quot; templates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ skel@@ ette , code cut@@ ters and files for link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any system available in the system @-@ tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agos : in about the restrictions you can imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tos ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ der templates are usually inserted in documents by means of link@@ ages ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ design tree under global templates . further information on Templates is available in . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text @-@ type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special sc@@ aff@@ inity for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ conc@@ er@@ ous tree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful when not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area always included in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final version to Javascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the pre @-@ design tree under global templates . see for more information about templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are intended for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , folded in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure after expos@@ ing ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template does not appear in the project tree . look in the pre @-@ working tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template store selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be done easily with dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging on the man@@ tra templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only to copy into a sub@@ folder folder , allowing all file management functions to be used , such as pulling and insert or inser@@ ting via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in file tree or in the project files for a folder on the right and backup the Site template , secured a name for the template and backup . by default , it will be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
project pres@@ ets allow a very target @-@ oriented pre @-@ orient@@ ations . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; create files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things using templates in projects very profound .
the pre @-@ class structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / Browser and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
to set the behavior of a folder in the box overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialogue appears :
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is deduc@@ ted , as soon as el@@ der@@ ous attributes are annex@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the board overview . if a master folder would basically dis@@ abling , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ building . if nothing appears , you probably will be in a master folder . &quot;
&quot; allows a copy or text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ prints for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ prints , a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( to show right mouse button ) on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the Editor Editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor Editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor Editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; Editor is working as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page , and a cursor appears . then , you can edit and switch if necessary to source code Editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP , contains a small green symbol of V@@ oh@@ and@@ als of &amp; PHP ; source code . it &apos;s not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor Editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor becomes visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor , this mode is already active , the keyboard moves the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
synchron@@ isation between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta - You can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation can be set in addition to the time period . basically the recommendation applies : a small sp@@ anne for fast calcul@@ ator and a large sp@@ anne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website so it is possible to choose the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; Editor , which is used to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows modification of content , such as keywords in the column name and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the view from pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is precisely like the met@@ ric elements possible . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style scheme by pressing the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is as in a text processing , due to be@@ ating with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves odd . text can be inserted by typing , and deleted by means of return or removing t@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ ting of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , surround with text , every other surrounding anchor day will be removed . &quot;
some work bla@@ sts like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are de@@ activated . they will later be used in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in this release the tables or lists of the toolbar .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of Stil@@ ts . in contrast to other programs for style templates the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style can be prosec@@ uted .
&quot; around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; neither the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ mp@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ ename without a fil@@ ename . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the most loaded style file name con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded for example a styl@@ istic file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified Mod@@ ular name is checked , agrees with each QNAP ME which contains the string template . &quot;

on systems with installed re@@ ad@@ line library you can use the arrow keys to / from the repository &apos;s memory available until now .
&quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass together as an argument . &amp; eg , with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a bracket is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ pl@@ ate@@ Name . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . why , so ? let me explain briefly why I wrote . &quot;
&quot; the compilation was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts throughout . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what was changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where maybe only the back@@ pack had changed . the assem@@ bling of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs . later a lot more useful functions were added .
&quot; if you want to compare for example fast text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned and diff@@ use 3 ; nearly into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way assem@@ bling is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps dis@@ solve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . in this editor you can edit the result even directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files when working together :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and combination of complete folders . this screenshot shows &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; in the folder assem@@ bling :
&quot; &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; shows the exact differences and control contains the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check the code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ulators are visible . if only lines differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hassle more if someone is changing the back@@ pack . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ es@@ work by simply write the fil@@ ename of the first file completely . example : &quot;
diff@@ use 3 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ folder
&quot; opening @-@ dialog allows the manual inser@@ tion of fil@@ ename , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the list . open dialog , you need to specify your selection and shows it next time . you need to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the comparing or assem@@ bling of folders will be selected for B and C but a folder , then used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if clas@@ hes is crossed , the input field will be active and can process itself . however , it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately . you can do this step later on saving . &quot;
the setup @-@ set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set Options before starting with the compar@@ isons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will then be able to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button . &quot;
you can also use pulling and insert : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains for example several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to load only two corresponding files , they would just copy them into &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply , insert and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t pull anything out of the diff@@ usion 3 ; only the case of text in a comparative window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the pulling and drop of text into another program as tri@@ c@@ ision and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text box there is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu ) . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees at the colour which file differs . if both files differ , the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( assem@@ bling ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the combination column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the constitu@@ ent column of the text , is interrupted in the places where the respective source file is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( under the comparison version ) also has a info @-@ line with the title issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains by the automatic co@@ operations already contain text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed is the storing de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to closest deleted / ung@@ sten conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ es @-@ windows are used , each difference is to be solved at the same time also a conflict of manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line belonging to the line will appear in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left appears a black bar .
&quot; sometimes caused by automatic comp@@ action or by manual editing no further line left in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you may change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy or add elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; cool@@ ed ; however , in the clip@@ board , however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go gently with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options numbers ignore or Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly using the mouse button and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page , beginning , end , late and string end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
in the following window you can also use the other keys to edit . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ lap mode . ( pres@@ et is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the connection columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section assem@@ bling and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Fig@@ ure back@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) option . if this is enabled , you automatically marking the clip@@ board and the manual copying is copied , because you could not over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; recept@@ acles are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a twe@@ et @-@ sign \ \ s \ or Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems using the source code \ \ s \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; also not with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when loading . ( menu entries - &gt; K@@ itt@@ 3 set ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences in curve letters are displayed . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in its pure form but would be trac@@ ed . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically represents an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted in the case of the tab@@ s button . otherwise a t@@ abo@@ o sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you enter input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board falls then . &quot;
you can select which type @-@ type you prefer to save . the value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when using files tried &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when joining together , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ plate &apos; \ &apos; s &apos; and a row @-@ off &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others simply save one row @-@ off @-@ side comparison , but then you might be different . if this option is activated , if this option is activated , if this option is activated , this option has to be disabled . in default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis figures figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; inten@@ tionally search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files . &quot;
&quot; in Autom@@ atically further jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is dealt with . &quot;
&quot; redeem automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters occur in many files less important . if you need this only from time to time , then you can use better the functions of voters A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . &quot;
these options are covered in the chapter on the scan of folders and exec@@ uting a compilation . look for details among documentation about the directory comparison and routing .
&quot; if a file is stored and already a older version exists , then the original version is displayed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this without further securing will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the UI . change this option does not affect the current running program . you need to finish &amp; diff@@ use , so that the change will be active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is globally available over the control center . ) &quot;
the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting is used .
&quot; over the selection of fields for enco@@ ding appears a short notice , which is the local enco@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters treated and interpre@@ ting . since enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and combined . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding to be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not be able to function using your co@@ de@@ c . ( e.g. your files can only be Unicode with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the enco@@ ding of the output command . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress the high@@ lighting of changes in white signs into the text or Over@@ view . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + -@@ Comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are shown . but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files ; -@@ g ; C or B ; -@@ g ; C is indicated next to the normal nor a second excess column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . flas@@ hing the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; assign the comparative window to each other , or other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide almost immediately to merge the files together . a simple click starts the compilation and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as pre @-@ called names for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the compilation again , then the name of the last used output is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; reading a file it will be handed over to this external command at first . in &amp; diff@@ use 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the back@@ pack . &quot;
&quot; reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when entering this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own preferences , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line has to have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility in placing the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program the good news . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into big letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s . the \ \ U turns into the found text in the first cl@@ amp . the \ \ U turns the found text in big letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key word \ \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ He@@ ader \ \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; s _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; s _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; $ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ BA@@ R _ date \ \ &apos; \ &apos; s _ BA@@ R _
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiment , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may have these regular phrases . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equals . sed &apos; / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable one and each suitable matches will be replaced with nothing but quasi .
sometimes you might want to perform several jobs at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Get / switch &apos; However , per@@ l requires some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the &quot; &quot; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ generator will be retained for display and co@@ operations . the further operations are only changing the data that is called Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ off @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ roll@@ er@@ essor will see the output of the normal operating system as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; complete folders re@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... making a suggestion for every object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can sim@@ ulate the assem@@ bling and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without using it really ;
... &quot; leads selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and combination of single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
&quot; when three folder will be merged , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start working together . to start working together , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will receive a little news window on the current progress . if you break the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when the folder is finished , displays &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click the arrow button or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two features all sub@@ directories .
&quot; if you click on a file , the file will be started and it appears a comparative window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the type of disk is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ ing window to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ cep@@ an action can not be selected automatically . if the co@@ existence will be started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture is to be seen in the columns A / B / C , the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; at identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders will be regarded as identical , if its overall content is identical . then the folder also have the same color . at folders , the age is irrelevant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes , and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same type of data ( such as A folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merger cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same data type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merger cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the sync mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target sub@@ folders were specified and if the option directories is synchron@@ ised . then choose &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... a and B exist but not identical : merge together and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; Right after the co@@ operated copied and diff@@ use 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders will be merged and the option updated file instead of compilation ( uns@@ ure ) is enabled , then the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long such errors will not be eliminated , the combination of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the assem@@ bling , one file is processed after the other . it status column shows he@@ avi@@ d if the co@@ existence was successful , and accordingly other messages , if something exp@@ ires , you should make a last check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; when in furnishing dialog , the file comparison method is selected to display full @-@ term analysis . these contain the number of un@@ com@@ ers , deleted , non @-@ white and whi@@ tish conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folder can be compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all the entries have been selected at once . if you have selected all contrac@@ tion actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the assem@@ bling . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder combination mode , is used as the target , when the two @-@ folder compilation is chosen as destination and used when synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all the entries should be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped over the certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ ador@@ able surprises : &quot;
to merge all the records : select directories starting / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cuts ) . to enter only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements points out . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all the entries , a dialogue window appears with the Options , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulate when you only want to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; and diff@@ use 3 ; then leads certain actions necessary with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merger window will pop up ( note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished using a file , select directories again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved there , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; on a mistake , a message , and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will find a message and detailed status information . on the end of the list , you will be able to try to select the cause of the problem or fix the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merger . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually combined , these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them back in later merge all entries will not be re@@ printed or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merger action , these entries will be re @-@ merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ itt@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory assem@@ bl@@ ings with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is not to match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to that pattern are not shown in the element tree ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to that pattern are not shown in the element tree ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
&quot; ignored files , which would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . ) &quot;
in some fil@@ yst@@ emen files have a multip@@ lies . in other file systems marked a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
&quot; for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic short@@ cuts is compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : when the option is switched off , the link will be switched off . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ) will not affect possible recur@@ sion . ( note that this option is switched on to a End@@ ress loop , and diff@@ usion 3 ; ) This option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ compromising , non @-@ white and whi@@ tish conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster , just change the change date and file size . however , this velocity costs will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is out@@ dated in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the change of change . there is no real comparison . the files are regarded as identical , if they are equal to such . this option can be useful for example when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is out@@ dated in default . &quot;
&quot; enabled the sync mode when two folder must be compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are selected , so that both folders will be identical . also the results of the co@@ ction of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is regarded as uns@@ afe , because it will not consider the knowledge that the other file was not also changed . ) This option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also affect the normal combination of single files , not only the co@@ operated folder . this option is switched on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; normally , the Fol@@ der @-@ compilation view are visible to the merger of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window folder in the window menu and switch to switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . nevertheless , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . once you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not work once again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you want to read the directory again : list box : new &quot;
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ user uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open which are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively and@@ und@@ own . or .. contained , this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
special characters must be mask . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space @-@ line &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol it used . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or folder , then a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit permission or change date . therefore , the eligi@@ bility or change date from the original . ( please note the option confidential by the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the purpose is currently as differences viewers in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the Differ@@ ent viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , the input file takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the context @-@ section , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the interplay or the compar@@ isons of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( well , it is comp@@ ass ) there are already . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or to go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources compiled and the configure script probably does not notify the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the pres@@ et@@ ting installed configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( such as diff@@ use 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not identical as not identical . if pro@@ lines are next to each other , this mal@@ is , but this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will remember every difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . however , this important information is easy to resolve by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , and it &apos;s too much effort to design an extra file format that this information might store . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit greater quantities of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ use 3 ; use many colors for producing differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lack the purpose . use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ use 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / diff@@ use 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; diff@@ use 3 : -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives the folder to your system in which KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nonetheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists of it . &quot;
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt Rem@@ ove ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt inser@@ tion ) fits the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all the folders , are not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you must update to these options the folder with the function Update . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries appear to have the differences . this also performs that identical files are not already copied into the target folder , if the target folder will not already exist , they are missing according to the compilation . ( the behavior will probably be deduc@@ ted in a later program version . ) This option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already exist ) . if the lines already exist , they will be removed when clicking the button accordingly . &quot;
in default this option is disabled . under@@ differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ retro@@ spective of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the desktop , to change their size or move it . this works both within a desktop and in several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop areas as well as the applications that are running . the applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is folded : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only two entries to be set up ... and Be@@ ating . if however , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it is also attached to the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries , maximize , on desktop and completion . the commands will make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . only appears if used to an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears if used to an application .
&quot; if this cross @-@ box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is marked , are listed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual working areas appear . &quot;
&quot; cross@@ ds this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas show , it is shown together with name , the names will be provided with folders , and eg , 1 . &quot;
&quot; when this field is marked , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is marked , the ongoing programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ space will appear to allow the selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window will be selected . simply shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will appear : classi@@ cally , like p@@ ager applications appear in some other windows ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual working areas in a wa@@ vering and vertical in a vertical range , which is very well suited for display lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ bus program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , display the windows as symbols or with their content and move it . furthermore , it is running out of the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and following options choose between switch @-@ up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ an c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you need to register as a user root or register to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ elling mode and assign to this a value . &quot;
&quot; there &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE pack@@ ets . &quot;

&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the default mouse pointer . please note that this is not able to see the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the default box ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the drop mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and the buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magnific@@ ation window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can get the contents of the enlarge window and move it . this is also possible with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift ; press , or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; using this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop window remains fixed and only the lower right edge is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy into a file to add to the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , the picture turn and much more . &quot;
start or stop the update of the display . the stops of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , low , financial , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU @-@ time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse click whenever the mouse cursor a while at the same point . it is meant to help people suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ ins syndrome ) and those of each click pains .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse click , once the mouse cursor a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ ins In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each click pains . besides this , however , it &apos;s a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that can be caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may also seek pain that interact with your computer you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , avoid pain that will be caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by collecting the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click whenever you break the motion shortly .
&quot; is the smart for@@ ging activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it will em@@ ulate the press . move the mouse up to the end of the movement , before the release of the mouse button is exec@@ uting a little practice , but you get used to get used quickly . &quot;
this residence time has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse click .
&quot; is smart@@ ly switched on , the rotary kno@@ ck @-@ time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set to release the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button is waiting before it will release the mouse again , if the mouse is left no account of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports now the clicking by mouse displ@@ ac@@ ement . this function is activated by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow way back to the right and back , followed by a break . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times . open it to sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value in order to shor@@ ten the answer times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is launched &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other shut@@ ters , please draw the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all the settings back to the values that were adjusted when opening the dialog . have already pushed the button , the settings are put on the stand after the last drop of use . &quot;
&quot; at best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart sho@@ ve should be switched first off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click it , you can later move the smart sho@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble button , it may be necessary to reduce the reply distance of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on vac@@ ancies in the browser window that does not constitute a link . you can therefore use the mouse on such vac@@ ancies until you would like to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ led , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only puri@@ fy the mouse ball , but also the roles that will come in touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is different to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole , in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a verb start is started . if you use in this case the smart sho@@ ve means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer end by the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this means the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it will be reset and you can work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and pres@@ enter the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place the cursor on where you want it . however , you park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you don &apos;t want to create a keyboard short@@ cut . safe zones for the mouse button are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles from windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent delay , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent for@@ ging is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the clip@@ board and execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button , but here are some advice to them : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t use the smart for@@ ging not only if you just start doing &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click at the one end of the text@@ area a mouse click , while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again pressing the mouse button once again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , every time you play a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when in the intelligent for@@ ging the sho@@ aking time begins . later , you can use the smart for@@ ging even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor is briefly t@@ apped . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those the actu@@ ation of the mouth @-@ est pains . &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as it is a certain time waiting for a gyp@@ sum procedure begins before the mouse button is left . in this way the pulling and dra@@ gging with the mouse can be done .

&quot; m@@ mouth ; is a program , with the mu@@ le user can speak their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let your computer speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the course of propositions , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes screen photo ) enter the command , which is later used for voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the application . &quot;
on the second page you can choose the default textbook . from the text files you can often use the text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be processed .
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the word supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can use the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only spell words can be taken into the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a reference memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear in the input field you want to listen . each spoken set is attached to the memory reservoir . you can select these propositions which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the site Wor@@ lds , as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card version , enter the command to call the voice @-@ generator . in the selection field under the input field , you specify the string enco@@ ding with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mouth , knows two types to pass the text . select the cross @-@ box when the text is to be passed as standard to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ box is not selected , the text is distributed as a parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
of course the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; using the kt@@ ts@@ d as language service is called &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; application is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text message , you determine which action by the keyboard short@@ cuts or through the choice of a text message in the menu text pass@@ book or in the ly@@ re for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text box is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the input field . with the selection of In the input field the selected text box is entered first only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the editing window , you can specify if the textbook is automatically saved in the editing window by the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book is stored with the selection of text @-@ pass@@ book , the book is saved . if you choose changes , the text password will not be saved . if you ask for saving you will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the textbook is to be saved . &quot;
the page vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the entry field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ box you can select the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or to export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
&quot; select this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation one . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by dra@@ fting the appearance . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to add just right words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are combined , and how this will be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words are automatically included into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout the time . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text files . in the upper part the text pass@@ agen@@ books are displayed as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text message , you can change the text trip or the associated keyboard short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text @-@ password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either get over the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a fol@@ dable menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages , you can change through drag the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the clip@@ board . if the text section is selected , then it is used , otherwise select the selected areas of reference . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of reference . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text in the input field is used , otherwise it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of reference . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is indicated , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar toolbar can be arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the narrow left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is indicated , there will be a narrow ly@@ re in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is indicated , this menu item is indicated , is displayed by default via the editing window directly under the toolbar . by mouse on the narrow left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice @-@ over@@ s on the card voice . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
&quot; Festival is a language output system of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ tically supported . the license allows to use Festival free of charge without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , is believed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; s@@ worn language generator . currently he only supports the English pr@@ on@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to share without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up voice output , is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS are installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ eroll . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
for the third example the option is to send data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to set the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax felt like the last character of the text , so that an extra character must be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ x@@ la / de@@ x@@ la / de@@ x@@ .@@ wa@@ v / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data as standard input must be switched on .
&quot; the voice @-@ output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; D ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; since the settings of the language generator will only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; mouth ; &quot;
&quot; for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ b ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but depending on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to the text by calcul@@ ator . it is a list of already stored sentences , which the user can always be re@@ ed again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth contains no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; at the first start of t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will appear in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers provide different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that are different in volume or speed . you should also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speakers . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printing ratings for the same printer .
&quot; click on the card holder speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card speaker will be displayed . this will also be released automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all furnished speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the first speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .

&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text , which is to be read , and choose in the main menu Tools text . after a short time it should start the voice output . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the text you want on a Web site . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ aded and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can preview the text displayed . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then you should start the voice output . &quot;

&quot; filter for string setting offer a good opportunity to correct and rec@@ ess ; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages , the mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as an assumed . read about this also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed , before he is sent to the program Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for improving the pr@@ on@@ unciation to select false word or speakers to select a suitable language and speaker or to handle specific defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; Sign@@ s ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be pres@@ et to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application , the messages used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can enter the room . &amp; k@@ b ; al@@ erts are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order , which you encounter from the map orders , is a text message . K@@ Say@@ ite is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text records are intended for the output longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four lines of order are processed in queue , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while reading , just such a pre @-@ reads , will keep this issue and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text records as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied . &quot;
filter editing the text and pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further kinds of filters .
&quot; drawing tor@@ tur@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the plac@@ eable parts can be provided either as words or as regular expressions , which make use of chat @-@ motiv@@ ators like : - ) by text or for reform@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable manner . &quot;
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can filter orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text of KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has single @-@ adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice @-@ output . if the filter determines that its rules does not exist , he will continue to change the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ erts , it is edited through all the activated filters , which were arranged on the page below . the processing by the filter is made in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be the further down of the following furnishings .
&quot; if you have a list of words or regular words , you need to insert a list of words or regular expressions as comparison . if these patterns are exchanged in the text , the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text . large and small @-@ sp@@ elling is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; if you choose a name for your filters . you can select this name as desired , it will only be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular phrases . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is processed in the specified order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete them . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered here , the filter is only applied when the spokes@@ person speaks for the text message one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &quot; C@@ tr@@ l &quot; button . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separately by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; and the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you must we@@ dge . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only copy copies . &quot;
the character reduction filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box &apos;s filter when match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to words , the character matrix filter rules are used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding characters ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this handbook you will not find instructions for writing regular phrases . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regulatory or editing as help to gathering these expressions , you can find it in the di@@ alogues Ad@@ ding or editing as help to gathering these expressions . the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; re@@ trac@@ er &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such environments . however the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via the ambient variable PA@@ TH is also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; you can send texts to a particular speaker that is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that lyrics by k@@ mail must be read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before reading ; a text by the filter is available , it is a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen according to the speaker properties that the program proposes to write the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , and select the characteristics of the speaker card speaker . with the speaker card filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered here , the filter is applied in case the filter is applied . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regulatory and # 160 ; regulatory versions are installed , you can call this one click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the start of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you determine the characteristics of the desired speaker . if the text fulfil@@ s the filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements on the same . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the intercom filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box den@@ ces filter if necessary . you must enter at least one condition at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers to lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts can be used ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so you do not work at all . you need to do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the ambient variable PA@@ TH . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole propositions will be printed or just Kau@@ der@@ ac . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option code enco@@ ding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string sampling filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . take a look at the website of the kt@@ oria . look for information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to bro@@ aden it ; for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not necessary . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text from the source archives , or downloaded the source file from the source archives , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using , check first if Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the shell script , SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts used ; the program Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher should be developed so further , that the setup of Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD conf@@ conf@@ uses is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is crus@@ hed in individual phrases . the user can go back or descending two , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application text on &amp; Desktop , you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . thus , an application is chosen for example , whose language is English and whose gender is feminine , otherwise it is automatically selected by the best fitting speaker . if you want to know more about how to choose them , you will see a speaker . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map spokes@@ person to add or click Edit , the card card speaker is displayed . as an example , the map of the module is displayed for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable spring program . if the path is included in PA@@ TH you just have to enter the festival .
&quot; select the string enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to festival . in case of voices , the tables ; it is commonly considered that Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak . ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you place volume , Interphone speed and clay @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and this grey will not be displayed , the voice you chosen will not have chosen these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded multiple seconds due to their size . if you mark this cross @-@ line , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( on large memory consumption ) the first set is faster syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box can not be selected , you still have no speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; marks this cross @-@ box marked , is visible when starting from t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box is marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the option to read or use it in any way . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can jump off in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on the OK , all changes of settings are taken over and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text records are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . for more information about the news types of tables ; you will find in . &quot;
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audi@@ o@@ dul or script ; the necessary libraries can not load .
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio @-@ output , select the audio output . if no output modules are selected in the list , you need to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M device . see also the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; set the intercom speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to roughly half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % roughly the double normal intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click apply to take the new settings for the running &amp; desktop ; to take over the system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language lectures : &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be pres@@ et to all other entries , and holds these orders . after the output of the screen readers have been read , the announced orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application , the news speaks . if you &amp; eg , just have a long text on a web page , you can greet you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone can greet you straight to the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen controller , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , when a normal text message is interrupted . if both in@@ conduc@@ tive sound and introductory message will be active , the introductory sound is performed before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card apply only for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of screen controllers , there are no special actions when this is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news to be read , launch t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ box to turn the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disadvantage , this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and reading ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog , where you can choose the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , sending &amp; conversation , when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is none other , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to define what &amp; oc@@ ts ; do , if an event is meeting , you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . default chosen the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels of events . for a specific event of a particular application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action is performed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option the action is applied to carrying out standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this purpose you can set the noti@@ fications al@@ erts as follows :
&quot; use the button save the button to save the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button load to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all items except all disadvantage will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , the sound speed , the volume of the voice and the pitch . also marks for controlling the pr@@ on@@ unciation of for example abbreviations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
&quot; currently , supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice that is used at the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or audio situation at the Festival @-@ configuration dialog is not available on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tivity filter ( SD@@ T filter ) . SB@@ Ds can begin to read , as only the first set of syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text message . thus , you can also stop or stop and stop , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the typing errors filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a pro@@ posi@@ tivity filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tivity filter , beginn@@ er is recommended but of it . &quot;
&quot; at the easiest way , you learn the setting of the speaker selection through out . place the speaker option again , change some properties and check out how to choose the speaker . you will of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; but faster with reading can begin , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop text orders on the card , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal proposition should be set up automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . he can not be off , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tivity filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typing limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typing limits ( tab automatically ) . note that the default code filter filter is included .
&quot; SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from the view of the normal statutes filter , you can insert this again by loading the file named _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map of the card , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card will be shown , if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties .
&quot; the use of the appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , select or edit , select this speaker . otherwise , choose &amp; rec@@ tor ; the speaker that most fav@@ ored the original properties . &quot;
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature plays no role , don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
select this cross @-@ box when the property should prevail over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when dealing with the issue is , this is always considered a priority feature . you will be considered this property rarely . the only case if you possibly want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than the one used in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the area Spe@@ aker , which matches the following to delete , click on the button Select default speakers and then use to speaker which matches the following below . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required ) .
t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support but I do not get back tracking .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is de@@ pl@@ eted and kt@@ oria was finished . probably you have to register the G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not resolved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work when I &apos;m playing at the same time with another application music . if I consider a text message , free@@ zes &amp; stor@@ ts ; a message that said : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . references to possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ depress@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and you can use it at the festival , but t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr displays this voice . &quot;
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ al@@ int / . the new voice added . as a guide can give you the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program has to be installed and be fin@@ alized through the ambient variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored , if &amp; b . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set the intercom speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that websites with a female voice should be read . I have set up a female Festival speaker but reading the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day S@@ able Gender does not appear to function . so that festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file throws the x@@ ML file to change from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber &apos;s gender @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I added a separate character reduction filter and now I can go back &amp; rec@@ ess ; no more sat@@ anic orders are displayed or rec@@ ede . on the map orders is displayed , the order disp@@ osed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , frac@@ ture , punc@@ tu@@ ation , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be fil@@ tered . use for these characters instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ disp@@ ect@@ .org )
sc@@ ams in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . please note that the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered by calling the G@@ ST register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users are experiencing in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts at the audio @-@ issue . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously listen to music and start a text . free solutions for this issue can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you keep a text message in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of the intercom speed , but otherwise not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;

the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a running time dependence of non @-@ free software .

&quot; before you are using , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , intercom speed and pitch . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help to find in the instructions , which can be delivered with festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / etc / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ish ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding like for example Ko@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; they are therefore looking for a first look at the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ically such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then the Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; mb@@ one ; thus it takes the audio @-@ over@@ s . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; the voices and the &amp; mb@@ one ; -@@ votes can be downloaded by
please note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no full voice output system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create these di@@ phone . festival created this by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be obtained from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; with this method , additional Wr@@ apper Code is added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; note that the &amp; mb@@ one file is not installed in the &amp; mb@@ one ; -@@ Fol@@ ders will not be installed in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; folders will be installed , but in the folder Festival / lib / . &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; - votes . needed either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be downloaded in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the entry of the bug fixes is not required ) you only need to translate the Festival . add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ec@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on the map setting intercom choose a voice and put the paths to &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o right .
&quot; E@@ pos is a free , qu@@ el@@ ist voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient stim@@ ulus quality . with this voice syn@@ thesizer just adjust the volume . &quot;
&quot; launch t@@ ms@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the card card speakers click Add . select the c@@ pos programs in your PA@@ TH , enter the path to the programs on the card speakers . enter in a &amp; con@@ sole ; em@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ist voice syn@@ thesizer , which has been written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume or intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; the command line module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts , using any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; con@@ sole ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command to write voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this handbook explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; Control center ; that allows the management of the network interface , routing and the DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop preferences over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the G@@ k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; to create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; Control center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting &quot; &quot; Control center &quot; &quot; ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties allows . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded through adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings is loaded , when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this one is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the hanging range is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date is best matches . due to the setting of the setup non @-@ again the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this option will be automatically pres@@ et . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are shown , which means the settings can only be considered , the chan@@ gers is not possible . in the system management mode , you can click by clicking the button control mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of the password required . &quot;
in the system management mode the total functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . by the rider network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings are displayed network interfaces through selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface set up ... set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button of the button below shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are picked up by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list may be chosen either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
with the selection Manual can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ network is set to be set .
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values indicated in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . by ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on or switched off . inser@@ tion of a re@@ activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on or switched off . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
&quot; defines the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; when the computer is more than a network interface , the interface to the network must be selected in which the Gateway computer is to be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . that is necessary because computers can only be understood IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the machine to the nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the equ@@ est@@ rian name solution enables easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and execution or down@@ si@@ fication in the list with the buttons or possessions in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button of button , adding ... out of the group calcul@@ ator a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add to the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group of computers to the nam@@ esp@@ ace solution , select one entry and then click on the button &quot; &quot; Edit ... &quot; &quot; the Edit dialog is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes calcul@@ ator IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list is named specifically known calcul@@ ator some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses will support . this still in the test will be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several ali@@ ases , de button Ad@@ ding several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a specified calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to Edit calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command will be deduc@@ ted . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly sharing packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; using rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic interface like a package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; D ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; net@@ work@@ conf : the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all of you will be reviewed by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
this section may not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x will only provide basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home country ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found major distribution . the IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is now focused in the near future . this description focuses on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the contact , which is a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
&quot; setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so it is possible to any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 is used . the range is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , which is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of its own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is needed for the IP address . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; &amp; soldier ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . the first goal was to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a surface for tar , which provided my wife : how much longer it takes , if you save ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it needs to be involved in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; soldier ; p@@ ult the band back and reads the cl@@ amping information of the ban@@ ana . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat , the pre @-@ sp@@ ann on the band will not be asked if the band is being form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; dat : the pre@@ amp , searches it according to the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the band &apos;s work to indicate that the band was involved . in the stat@@ us@@ bar appears a corresponding message . the contents of the tape can now be searched out by l@@ apping of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the ban@@ ana , first of all , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat : there is a change in the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band , and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it can be used , it must be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; a band &apos;s fonts have to form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this procedure does not correspond to the form@@ atting of data ; this procedure may not occur before you are form@@ atted by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted , however , do not occur a form@@ atting of the ban@@ ker , DA@@ T drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , with the form@@ atting of the ban@@ ana . all the data on the band will be lost . after completion of the form@@ atting , the band will be automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to pick up the files . it can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only saved to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files shown in the profile are secured .
select files in a local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu She@@ chem ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings will open up for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and choose the menu item ...
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog box appears to check . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the application folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialogue appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files you need to be restored . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the belt . it will only be restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be selected as selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select re@@ manufacture in the menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialogue settings for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it is necessary to re @-@ create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file based on the band &apos;s content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape : &quot;
&quot; this makes a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , which is to take place in which the backup will take place . the list of transm@@ uted files will be automatically updated according to the selected operating folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folders listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are stored on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be saved . only the files are stored since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; and files were not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu Settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device driver for the band@@ work ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path has to point to the non @-@ recur@@ ring variant of the belt unit .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat : before the band is involved the command load load to the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be done . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat : the draft to un@@ lock the belt drive . possibly this attitude does not work at all band@@ drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , is switched on when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . use this option not at flo@@ ppy stream . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ ring block size for belt transmission . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you need to notify you , in any case the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; soldier ; a band is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the ban@@ ker . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is billing : seconds , where billing the complete name of the system is form@@ atted in which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number seconds that has been form@@ atted since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to be used with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ dat / dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which are directly connected with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . in addition allows you to quickly access information about problems related to their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine does in the background makes . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; system@@ ic log ; experienced users allow quick access to information about problems related to their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with which help the protocol files to be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
&quot; support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screenshot , presents &amp; system@@ ic log ; functions available with their help , the individual protocol @-@ lines of a log file easily filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook . &quot;
&quot; after starting the system is trying to open &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system protocol , so you don &apos;t have a small message window , so you don &apos;t have access to system management . the protocol files are usually not listed in folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justification for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or according to the filter bar . in the default setting , the list box will be displayed automatically , so that only a log line will be displayed . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string string will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the string file format , select the column process , and enter in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol @-@ lines which have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with an eye @-@ eye color as protocol @-@ lines of level clu@@ es . the colored presentation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched on .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the protocol protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , then you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocols files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are.@@ D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of sources by &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; Fe@@ el log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section performs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing for the control of the program start at the high speed of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here further in historical aspects ( e.g. because I do not know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ install and re @-@ format file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder from / etc are directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service that you would like to start at the peak of the system or when changing to another runtime system . system services include not such items such as set@@ tee , that only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for this . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default runtime is listed in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ placed Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can fix something through the in@@ it@@ tab , then you get it repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you want to enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you do not find correct files . instead each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how started and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if that includes a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointer device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can change scripts also from Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else . however , the entry is removed from its original runtime ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : items will be moved if you choose to copy them into a new area . to copy it to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly copy copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you once again try to insert the system service .
&quot; note : at present , there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ s button to enable the different work@@ ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 stop , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another runtime , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired runtime using inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting code or the name of an entry manually , press the button button to switch the Properties dialog box . use the tab@@ s button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise , the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) will be available . otherwise , they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; modifications will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to boot in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime system at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have a few system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for the execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the type , such as system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , but does not match the configuration for the proprietary interior programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply finish without a message , if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user name and the user list . to edit the user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears to the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have activated on@@ c@@ tions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD boxes . &quot;
the card password appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
&quot; this card card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in file system space file ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the space restrictions is stored in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system
&quot; map groups informs about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can be joined in other groups by speci@@ fying these in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog characteristics of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu item or group or click the appropriate adding button of the toolbar . the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password and change the time up to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , change , and change more . &quot;
