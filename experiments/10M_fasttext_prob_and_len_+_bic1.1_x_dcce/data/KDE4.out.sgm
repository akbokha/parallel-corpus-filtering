<seg id="75">"photography came; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, continuing software collection, which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to computer machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos are generally large files and transfers to the serial port it is now outdated; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>

<seg id="276">"the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields are supported. so there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last over the manual input of known places."</seg>

<seg id="306">"this is possible since blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red-proportions of the still unsaturated blue pixels from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter how much color or white you want."</seg>

<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the check-out; tool color effects provides you four color effects, a photovoltaic effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantonal filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar-arization, also called Sabatians, also called Sabatians. the colored, darker areas sheltered and the colours were inverted by the second lighting. this tool was a partial negatively of the picture. the result was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity shows the picture what is chemically possible. another increase creates ultimately a negativity that is not to be created on photocopier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and that works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation so that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and gloss. try it simple, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia provides very saturated color for daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers. Velvias strongly saturated color, but also some photographers, especially those of the little landscapes, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon in the contrast. the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the slices reps the strength of the neon. in large pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the colour contrasting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be satisfied in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo with bad light conditions you can get this reversed problem: one too great saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead. all changes that you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges of a picture to look more sharply. actually it doesn't use it rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"focus is perhaps the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitization process colors with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more thoughtful tightening than normal cameras for the user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG images, a camera has often been applied. pictures in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner have a sharpened filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpen a photo with the sharpening value chain. this allows you to connect with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should hereby avoid careful as the results does not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplification the noise. in general, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for softening with the menu entry. use the tool on the right side of the dialog window shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce often good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or the amount will increase the effect. if you make the unsharp mask too strong, roughing and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a edges affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. they should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image which is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable differential amount. this way, a minimum difference can be used for a channel of the filters. in this way areas with a soft switch between the killing of sharpen except and therefore beautifull error in faces, desks and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurinary filter. the original image is the (1) and the pictured image (2). unsharp mascot was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocus is focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unfolding filter for Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create an image to & quot; it is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpness of pictures is the use of an unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by placing colors Refocus on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular flow works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung is a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel, which is far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'ral Faltung is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular Schärfe: this is the radius of the circular thread. it's the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the standard value should put 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very blurred but then on Heiligenstad.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help artefacts. the correlation may be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter may help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0,1 only rarely helpful. if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will be even more feited."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. use this parameter if your unsharpness Gauß'sch is. in most cases, you should use this value to zero in order to avoid poorer artifacts. if you use a value uneven zero, you might need to also increase the correlation and / oderden smoke filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"size size: this value determines the size of the transationsmatrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular foam or the Gauß'schen loop. however, note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any number of refocus parameters you have set will therefore be saved for later and can then be loaded afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and Intensive corrections on the image before you use the module. "</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but they left inconvenient artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you have pictures to read and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blur polishing better results as sharpness. this could be causing the blurred mascot a larger neighborhood as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory it has to be blurred masquerying always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show that it is the optimal linear filter. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in editing small details.</seg>

<seg id="519">"detail posture [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a evenly smoothed above the picture. a value of 0.9 should keep details that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details of detail always should be subordinated to the right-dependence."</seg>
<seg id="520">"scheme dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-granularity or the CCD ruffles will produce a high value wave-like patterns.

<seg id="521">"smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum capacity factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value suitable to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more it is necessary, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a" van Gogh 'Turbulb effect it must be higher than 3. "</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. usually here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, there should be small angle to create a long runtime. you should thus choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated stepper [0,1, 10]: integral stepper in pixels. you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel and never larger than 2."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and allows the image to be bladed through the radius, and the color in it will be smoothed and thus smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpened gel. this value sets the pixelbow down the filter at the front to determine illuminants. if the value is high, the adaptive filter image details no longer receive and rustling or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the cantonal imprecision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency of the filter. if he is too strong cannot be removed all the rustling or rupees can occur. set it on a value nearby the maximum if you want to remove a shaking rustling or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either colour or illuminant to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details that is controlled by the details.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer greater transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has very high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rates up to 6.3 kbps and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -B 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compressive rate approximately 5.5. needs more 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo system with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compressive rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. well enough for music of young people, portable devices and car facilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane" = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting. "</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that can be manually entered by the program from the freeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & audiocreator; and the code program to create the folder name and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with code programs, there is often a combination of programmes for coders and those parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"e.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch must be added to lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '-tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people download the audio CDs that can be downloaded, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of text: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (Anm. the author meant) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so can neither the artist nor the music company may be attached. all information can be obtained from any bumblebee by a & CD; shop, physically, or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & audiocreator; is active a cross-crossing (sending an address). for the use of freeDB may not be used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used by calling the data from the server (This may only be the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freeDB, the geographically will be used on the next panel. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers an up-to-date list of mirror servers for the online call of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which expression program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see To be aware that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for storing the illuminated WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be chosen. when opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossfree compression for audio data) on the tab of the Kodierers. other coders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoding can be used. this is also required for the predefined code. for more information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welch Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a Kodierers, more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console) must be replaced by the name of the installed code."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device drawing of the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to indicate both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check whether you don't want to read a copy audio CD; read the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is one chapter with one step by step by step. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, not a problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme 'to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be installed as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not considered to be completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files as you can naturally always do."</seg>

<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to read it on any read of a & CD; change when the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device drawing is handed over to the reader program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify as tones on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP Section the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are needed above all to counter tones on the Perkconversation channel. take a look at the supplied keyboards.</seg>

<seg id="1684">"good, I cannot force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compressioning ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. first part we leave you, the second we treat you here."</seg>

<seg id="2065">"spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & b & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantapy; Resources files are replaced."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what was changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where maybe only the backpack had changed. the assembling of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs. later a lot more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare for example fast text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>

<seg id="2511">"first of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on vacancies in the browser window that does not constitute a link. you can therefore use the mouse on such vacancies until you would like to use them again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"if your mouse ruckled, you should cleanse your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only purify the mouse ball, but also the roles that will come in touch with the mouse ball."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"first, you need to take the mouse ball. as this happens, the mouse is different to mouse. however, it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"if you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole, in which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can be easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingernails."</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this means the status of & kmousetool; it will be reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and presenter the cursor to another place."</seg>
<seg id="2519">"solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place the cursor on where you want it. however, you park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you don't want to create a keyboard shortcut. safe zones for the mouse button are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles from windows."</seg>

<seg id="2522">"if you don't use the smart forging not only if you just start doing & kmousetool; click at the one end of the textarea a mouse click, while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again pressing the mouse button once again."</seg>
<seg id="2523">"use the audible mouse click. thus, every time you play a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when in the intelligent forging the shoaking time begins. later, you can use the smart forging even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise."</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your machine does in the background makes. the task of & ksystemlog; is an simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & systemic log; experienced users allow quick access to information about problems related to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, with which help the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, presents & systemic log; functions available with their help, the individual protocol-lines of a log file easily filter and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting the system is trying to open & ksystemlog; first the main protocol-file of the system - to open the system protocol, so you don't have a small message window, so you don't have access to system management. the protocol files are usually not listed in folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or according to the filter bar. in the default setting, the list box will be displayed automatically, so that only a log line will be displayed. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string string will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. select the string file format, select the column process, and enter in the filter bar the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all the protocol-lines which have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of level errors are displayed with an eye-eye color as protocol-lines of level clues. the colored presentation of protocol-lines can be switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (for example in the protocol protocol or in cron protocol), then you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as to start the samba server. in this case you will use the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocols files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol for display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / system log.forum-software.Dort you will find further information about the sources of sources by & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& Feel log; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section performs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing for the control of the program start at the high speed of the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further in historical aspects (e.g. because I do not know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstall and re-format file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder from / etc are directly in / etc. this folder is called rc..Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service that you would like to start at the peak of the system or when changing to another runtime system. system services include not such items such as settee, that only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for this. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-placed Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can fix something through the inittab, then you get it repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you want to enter in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you do not find correct files. instead each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How started and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if that includes a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server runlevel that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can change scripts also from Runleveln, or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else. however, the entry is removed from its original runtime (or its position). this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: items will be moved if you choose to copy them into a new area. to copy it to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly copy copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you once again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabs button to enable the different workranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 stop, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runtime, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired runtime using insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting code or the name of an entry manually, press the button button to switch the Properties dialog box. use the tabs button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) will be available. otherwise, they are saved by & ksysv; modifications will be saved in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts-resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to boot in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime system at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have a few system services provided with & ksysv; for the execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the type, such as system services can be started in these distributions, but does not match the configuration for the proprietary interior programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply finish without a message, if their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
