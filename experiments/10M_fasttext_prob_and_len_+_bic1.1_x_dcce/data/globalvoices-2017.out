&quot; although I had visited the USA for 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation grew up with American films , American authors have read and engaged in American music , American authors and his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 @-@ years I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a Jura @-@ Stu@@ dents , who were the highest Bundes@@ court with judges , who were incl@@ ined his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me as he is surrounded by its bott@@ ling .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague put it put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes that he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number , which was ever achieved by the party of the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte person , I asked me ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t get Tru@@ mp and his voters to tune with people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , the people from all over the world increases , a deep gl@@ it@@ ant man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view not coinci@@ de with the name of Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to look at the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ toler@@ ance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits with the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those affected by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp &apos;s journey to nom@@ inee re@@ publi@@ can presidential , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly past@@ es , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t to non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either share his racism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp &apos;s voters as R@@ assi@@ sten .
&quot; to arrange people , &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which are most white , for Tru@@ mp voted , because they would like to regain control of a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who reviews the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently from it . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . WC . : as much as &quot; dence of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; &quot; word game of white in attack on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as was the Great Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is definitely welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a K@@ eni@@ ans , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas for this promise and says : to hell with multiple , religious freedom , and all the concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; for all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who liked in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowds . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , could have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the amount answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Country , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( musi@@ c@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found their music instruments an opportunity to overcome them converted . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drugs misuse and gangs .
&quot; but this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , trumpet , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from trash bin
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made from re@@ treated waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ comp@@ lied instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycling line under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez have started to transform parts of the crash into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , sa@@ vers , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Be@@ at@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez recalls a local ec@@ ologist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ sing and we had to teach at the same place , at which the parents worked in the trash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something which he never had seen before : a made of waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and that is called The Recycling Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world generates around one billion tons of trash every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here you can turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that battles wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this paper , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , that the ship had already been operated in li@@ reported waters illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were therefore raised and little incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative crus@@ her of this species to its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they mour@@ ned to him , one of their har@@ b@@ ors and refuse to give him a fishing activity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply remember anything , &quot; &quot; reminds of Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading annex@@ ation of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . it is part of a team who discovered the ship time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then distributed out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crimin@@ alizes criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries , which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; in this way we have eight countries who are like s@@ inn@@ ed and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to read , because it is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; the inten@@ tional abuse of existing laws , through which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem harm , which have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once been hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so these actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can share with each other for example lists the existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that one could notice or experience during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in botanical areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be found - about such , which suggest that a ship invites its frozen fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the Ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations can indicate whether the participating ships were a fishing license where they were on the way , and possibly also whether they have a crime . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can deny the adoption of such ships in their har@@ b@@ ors . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to numbers from pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it then comes to significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing fishing does not mean more financially . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH network every year due to the illegal fishing network that penet@@ rate into eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa is one of the most productive t@@ una fishing plants , absent for the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . under these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; practices such as actions count as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit license papers , st@@ ating f@@ anta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could be illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &apos; you dar@@ ing my port not to run &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and just this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH was involved in more than 30 studies .
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks to spread the counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships , who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persec@@ uted ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Authority on combating crimes , F@@ ISH can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , which is to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships of accurate ships . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to enhance the illegal ships who like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example its automatic identification systems , which cannot be or@@ ated with more of satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal , criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened with Google and the Sea Protection Organization Oce@@ ana , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch opens : a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position can be displayed around the world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - this is simply meaning , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust has a similar project to run , in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense crimin@@ als , but they also det@@ ain@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; ships that have used earlier without licence , and barely expected to count on consequences , they now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH associates have now recorded a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats , has since buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 had set up , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tro@@ pp@@ ry , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing annually . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries closed there for six countries , so called West Africa Task Force , and now fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country of Somalia its first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used in tow , which meanwhile are prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was even penet@@ rated into botanical waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take @-@ of standards against Gre@@ ko 1 , the a strong sign that they pass against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat land of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ wald MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ located Bundestag on Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition looked upon by the pres@@ idents of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; however , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;

&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as a now adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting in the office , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he kept the family secrecy for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one can manipul@@ ate from his Father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ im@@ pover@@ ishment . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State ror@@ ism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 as Deputy commander of intelligence agencies in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor because of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced a boy over the years , and he had said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows that great power has a parent and has chosen one way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had rounded myself with a boy , the mar@@ tial sport . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and several days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend to it .
he said :
&quot; you are an ar@@ hole , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP . &quot;
just remember that they will not lead you one day and I must save you then .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - the revolutionaries &apos;s army - the military arm of the revolution@@ ists of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would be wal@@ k@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old , and in the situation I thought it was fine . for so my father had educated me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda and amat@@ erial , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; then , the prisoners are persec@@ uted &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to exp@@ ire . he led me to a Bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , cooling cabinets . &quot;
everything of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little wrapped in a blan@@ ket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were cancel@@ ed and kept me with an guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are persec@@ uted .
I paraly@@ sed and saw a song where men were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field of field and metal springs .
later I found out that they fortified the one at the end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they are rarely found a man with hand @-@ hand to the bed , over@@ pass it with water and j@@ ailed him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the frame there was dra@@ fted there ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do another so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand @-@ sh@@ akes and were appointed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face - all were captiv@@ ated on hands and feet .
near the entrance k@@ au@@ ded man still quiet on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I looked at the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ ure ? &quot;
&quot; I said , Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father was told at home .
&quot; in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero got a man together and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ ders . &quot;
the road that you came here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; looking at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were given a number assigned as part of the process of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the destruction of men and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; warfare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to go home .
&quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as she knew it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later myself at the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs that one assumes an enemy that one fought one enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked myself as my Father , the leader of the security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was the officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never really like to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crimin@@ als , and I answered , and you , who you get cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cried out : &quot;
if you go so far then I will find you and teach you yourself .
we do not need any other !
so my Father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I carried a jacket and a rolling swe@@ ater from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he also brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a co @-@ con@@ j@@ ures of this crime had been to be . I resist not a problem , they can put me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ able act &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ dial . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ hal@@ ted during the dictatorship of people . but what are the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
she was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
had these people not even families who could be handed over their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
&quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ able act , which one can do a man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me , when the democracy was introduced again , they used machines to eliminate the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were sm@@ ashed and somewhere , - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
thought to indicate my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , the whole betra@@ yed patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions , &quot; which allegedly defended them . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; he made only &quot; &quot; Na &quot; &quot; then remember me . &quot;
precisely what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I published the first ad . &quot;
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am so taken . I finally told against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest and before the end of the process .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , non @-@ law degree in 154 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of age . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the cl@@ onal order of the Ur@@ als .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process ended on a crime against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court stuck in 28 cases for life @-@ long detention and in nine cases arrest between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there was no hands . &quot;
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the process .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ ver@@ dict : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ condi@@ tion@@ alism &quot;
&quot; all the accused were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military operations , former police officers and civil workers . &quot;
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for the victims for years . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 @-@ based Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but research took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed over the land to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial could be built there , which is now guided by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto where one can extend his leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his leadership in the last month witnesses of a very special mis@@ fortun@@ ed translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word has been cont@@ ested ( cor@@ ei@@ ves sha ) , that &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; may be mis@@ diagnosed - perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant h@@ ears &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible drivers . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available from the 1st to the 20th of September to electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared in social media .
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , an inhabitants of Ky@@ otos . he was also who made aware of the local time . &quot;
the Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has been removed first . the term &quot; &quot; m@@ ant@@ ors &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the good , though gram@@ mati@@ cal is not quite correct term &quot; El@@ der &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto exc@@ olog@@ ised for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already included in the text and that the translation has not been checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported how follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we truly are sorry that older men felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News put something more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; scary &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fur@@ ry &quot; was indic@@ ative as an un@@ suitable description of older drivers . according to the police there are the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors caused 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; with this , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents have fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ ces caused by seniors in the same period has increased . &quot;
&quot; the Re@@ porter not named re@@ por@@ ters , in the published version of article comments to the light that show what pre@@ judi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; across Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true source of finding for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to move , one needs two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the output text and to active the language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers of the case . generally , the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a French native language should be translated from English to French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to mis@@ understanding of the reason@@ ing , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who even have no foreign associates do not let translations yet @-@ internal . then , the Japanese staff , whose German knowledge is considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ored and pu@@ zz@@ led phrases resulting from machine translation , show that this technique can still no longer be replaced by human translators . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ ger English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often t @-@ shirts or bags are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harmless . but from large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure greater standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of its translations in the future . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and C@@ ens@@ ored measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , announces Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they have no access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online stations over@@ laid recordings of protests in Car@@ acas , who were organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court was dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was dressed , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider is again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the dental veneers available with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant at the reporting of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations and Fin@@ ances , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
&quot; surprisingly , that is still more favourable than two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT filter confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had to say that local Internet providers sometimes use DNA . it is a technique that faul@@ ty the DNS server requests from certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or refused the request during the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ chapters oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission on Thursday , the 6th of April , adjusted as the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , which was carried out live in custody by the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten as he was in police food .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on broadcast again .
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus getting the Vene@@ tians of access to m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al coverage about current events in the country is increasingly difficult . &quot;
Paraguay will become a lot of girls for skins to receive an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and gather witness to other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of cur@@ vy .
&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by cur@@ ances , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they didn &apos;t work together with the family who lived there . &quot;
shortly before her degree degree at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; who has become something that has become something &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as one described in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money exceeds her minor son or her inferior daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned in this case , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that you cannot stand up . &quot;
these as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls , affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , researched and p@@ ran@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , guaranteed in general breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who love her daughter in believing that she can complete their training , improve their position in society and make &quot; &quot; something out of themselves &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl in itself and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that it would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is miserable , his family will only learn a lot of years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which occurs in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº came to hospital , her body showed traces of severe beats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official head office .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; several dozen people came together to protest , and demanded that there is &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay . &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a long study of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited for workers ; they also live isolated from other girls at her age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ neto where her father worked , convers@@ ing , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers had to now work all , and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
it stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fied the refrigerator , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she was finished with learning , the more leisure had it . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hunger , but got also not unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ edi@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings of the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and to read guidance from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade her to give the reports of official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held them indeed for intelligent , but did not stand with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had not found someone who spoke about politics while he spoke about politics &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be able to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; . &quot; in order they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Re@@ ar Ã­ , at home again their native ham@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had made it possible to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that they got for everything they got from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school was discri@@ minated against Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken , bullying and the ra@@ ils that Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta is . &quot;

the display was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have been a miserable girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , which came also from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered its 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment has been written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , which would like to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the version of the editor then turned out once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .

bill &apos;s draft writing Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ ations have recently agreed to a law@@ draft for the regulations regarding use of use and utility of social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , commercial users and users need to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up , which is charged to give citizens a permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , commercial users would have to register on the site with their right names and personnel numbers in order to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is dre@@ amed to do so , this could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a cash bu@@ ck@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ agli@@ ding , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , the social media is running and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video news and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced , as the draft no indication of how Egyptian authorities must impose upon registration and users who are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ ations and Pat@@ rons of the Legislative Council , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users , and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians , information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
yet it is not known so far that such plans are there .
experts on site are scep@@ tical with regard to the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research technology &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I really doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they feel that just as they could be ri@@ dden on physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then that means they can en@@ roll a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who have a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensures that no devi@@ ating sc@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the President of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y received a legislative position against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence was intended to be guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq the animal @-@ ai@@ ding H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which is protected by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to po@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they always find less loo@@ t . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza show in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ors in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , and the health and the prosperity of ecos@@ ystems also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ors exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards really is low in the wild , and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore , that they have a shot of a great cat in the cam@@ af@@ alle , R@@ aza breaks pleasure in pure joy . &quot;
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country that exists not only from war and conflict .

&quot; in early March 2017 the patented , which were achieved in the north of Japan , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o which have been made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , located in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring countries Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced out , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished all coastal cities of the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , for this alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey results of those affected by itself .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( commen@@ ced , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata were completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was reported Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ata has finished 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima form the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , one stri@@ ves to still try to reloc@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ accommodation ( broad@@ casts , Cau@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people forced to live in housing accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas at Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evac@@ uation managed by the disaster , were surrounded by final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ata the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; to determine how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which covers almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y hat@@ s in I@@ v@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing occup@@ ants have resum@@ ed its operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the A@@ cker@@ land in I@@ w@@ ata and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares are destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered from the far back , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains down@@ cast . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata are up to 90 percent at the same level , as before un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima in contrast , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal population , it &apos;s more difficult to feel their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evac@@ uation by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also , how their emp@@ tied to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness amongst the local population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of the evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic accident , the Japan . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the booth of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evac@@ uation areas are getting older than 50 years old . they have to compete in correct Beh@@ aus@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ata and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that 2020 will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one recognizes however often that a more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to bro@@ aden our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics , which often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment where they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday took him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a p@@ stock against the head . nationwide took millions of prot@@ esters in a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local portrait Lu@@ iz da Luz made pictures of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread out in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also identified the face of the police officers that came with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers like in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his drummer on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers would temp@@ ted from a demonstr@@ ator and land on the Inten@@ sive Station , his face would see six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked from the police officers and several sanitary briefly on it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also established in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of federal state , have donated more than 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to stay a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;

police over@@ handles
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only State in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police officers on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had established a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker say to violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media gu@@ este have dec@@ eived by taking the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported about a cerem@@ onial glass window to make an photo of their titles illustr@@ ative with a photo .
on the other hand the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with a fire set in the fire .
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken shut@@ ters than about the protests of thousands , which serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this is also necessary to recognize if you strictly violate any form of damage .
&quot; here also the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are dec@@ eived by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ator to counter @-@ fron@@ ts with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the For@@ induc@@ ing For@@ gotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ me , is located in the western province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there is no n@@ enn@@ able sugar @-@ harvest . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were made in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the awakening , the sugar cane industry in the region still lost , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the smells of steel and concrete was left . &quot;
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to be found new .
some are sel@@ dom the work .
&quot; other res@@ ies and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which are still ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an that stands in the morning every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane mills , who are back in operation after a long time , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i would receive the sugar cane factory but the promise has not been kept .
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ ag@@ ues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production was produced by 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad brass are already no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and barely competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that resulted in such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the growing crisis in the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ price increased from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 through 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and Food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw materials would manage about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today will come into history with certainty , which were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from that time the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , the breast@@ feeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for advanced training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich am 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , says about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
so that the place will get formed they formed a full @-@ time working group .
&quot; before the first year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially distributed to the documents that were removed only in relation to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could have received every dism@@ ember@@ ment . &quot;
from there the responsibility was arrested and the letters always came more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for those who were still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the l@@ apse of the factory , in which construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part that he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of employment . &quot;
the industry &apos;s best developed industrial area from Cuba and the most important job producers has been er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for working places and services that generated the plants in the communities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President asked to the eyes of the present people when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only highly extracted from the local elections .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ me , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; closed as the sugar cane factory , or better said , when they began to dis@@ connect them , they also heard on the road to asp@@ hal@@ es this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
you were part of spare parts .
&quot; without a future , many young people moved the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ and@@ forty harv@@ ests bringing the old soldiers a roe from two @-@ end p@@ olls per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ me .
&quot; Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and cle@@ arer voice , is no inf@@ lic@@ ated person , nevertheless , he gives the lies who told him not . &quot;
they have been tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene comes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them . they do this by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , our workshop manager mobile phones directly bring to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop increases that the young participants in discussions topics like &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ expression &quot; or whatever of them can be found in the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the motive of a video player to convey as important to obtaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation was recorded , the refrain of C@@ ree is sung . &quot;
&quot; the youth involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop Group , who was a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in Um@@ berto , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , I feel like no one would ever be interested in me . &quot;
but I try to go on earth for my days
that is the day when you are scattered our cry
because we lost our way in life as youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise to one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and proceed as well as our youth
they can do what they are determined by the Creator .
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ds ( which is also published on his blog and published here with approval new ) :
plastic meals are shown not only in the restaurant
plastic meals ( commen@@ d@@ ded ) outside of a typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , will be displayed close to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) from each food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see themselves these plastic meals and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic meals .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small businesses that manufacture the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago documented . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so common that they don &apos;t even look at them anymore . however , a new trend changes it today in con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ ggers released a series of social media links and photos , which will show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ dos . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic geri@@ es decorate mobile bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial food were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ectiv@@ es , as in this case , cool@@ ed magnets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cool@@ ers for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ es becomes increasingly elaborate .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone .
also this part we have made for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that gives your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ che@@ ated is used , a favorite place that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I believe I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic geri@@ es may also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members , too . &quot;
our new mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ ing belts made of dried salmon . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ rile plastic meals can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # failed .
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi which is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ing of the Restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ towards sandy beach . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ ses and fet@@ ching regularly only dive in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Z@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there are hardly any one looking at the sad@@ ness or the congregations who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; standing behind each body , behind every bone report in the hundreds of married tom@@ bs , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never be heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug market &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if business close because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities therefore need many kilometres to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is married each weekend tom@@ bs to his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father in just one day , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again on the task we have put forward , go away and looking for gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my Son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
&quot; you are standing in the insurance of my Father , but that does not get them out , because they require a mort@@ gage . &quot;
where should we get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and government leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in the high risk of risks .
here are some excerpts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never look as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I have now know illness and sensation journ@@ alism now for some years now .
&quot; I come over every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from experts . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the inhal@@ ed or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who had once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ valid or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is , as would they temp@@ t those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories about mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the Tat@@ eless@@ ness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring village be justified that they were settled .
&quot; I think they are trying to speak that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city distri@@ butions : how a family with threats was lo@@ oted . in this , it describes how armed crime month for month money from their business , until they ended not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain also goes by never , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again if you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers also . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are away , the better . &quot;
they included their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will guide you or to kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would solve my deep @-@ root feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence signed .
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ ks that makes potatoes warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which is with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water , sugar and milk pul@@ sing . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been over two years before , when he saw a few blocks from his home , the bloody ly@@ che of his father had been shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
in 2010 alone the Public Prosec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some of hundred thousand @-@ thousand stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those we have not forgotten .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched a project journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the sharpen@@ ed struggle against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in intel@@ li@@ gible manner . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , include pictures on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact@@ check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or , or fal@@ si@@ eve a for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years that came up after something the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading , used to be@@ ware trage@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but there will be questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a pet@@ rol station sail@@ ed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . in doing so , 230 people came alive . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and had been devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with stro@@ kes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
tragic was the victim of the pet@@ rol station to the victim .
&quot; representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ er homes covered including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ating the football world championship . &quot;
houses scattered and disgu@@ ised corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ s@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Vari@@ ous photos of the incident form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for that .
it shows rows of disgu@@ ised bodies based on the ground up while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was captured several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and may not be attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , the K@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , the villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ ses were burned in streets and bushes .
&quot; there have been reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained to count to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were distor@@ ted , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up period could be represented .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army prot@@ ector in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the image from the Democratic Republic of the Congo back to , as it is proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2.000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa Check has documented certification to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ ages .
one step further bring personal comments such as this example may be mis@@ diagnosed the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image from San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape beats , rape and several dead , some through com@@ bustion . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which was mis@@ diagnosed with the President of mar@@ s Th@@ a . in addition , monks and politicians had been involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to collect this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P referred to as their source , had also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ an His statement , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false link up to the years 2011 and 2012 are actually coming back from all over the world .
&quot; with a &quot; &quot; recommended picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can be exceed . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18,@@ 8 billion images ( stand dated 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a combination of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , others tried to disp@@ ens@@ ed the counterf@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ etes examples for ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they had been published . therefore , we want to be more evident than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked to each other ) , several examples of mis@@ used use may originate . &quot;
here some cases that can now be fully split ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or server over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples , the according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also fake examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( set himself an Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; one side , which leaves rum@@ ours , presented in question that the said photo Christians shows that were killed by Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City outlines not only the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions after the intentions of the persons and the resulting trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ blica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
&quot; La Rep@@ Ãº@@ blica cited as its source of the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( where not known , if the original report included the picture ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; t@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions following the mass@@ acre of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , like this one , which illustrates the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; , &quot; clearly no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which ref@@ utes this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster called the faul@@ ty use of the picture since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ators in Pam@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , peac@@ em@@ akers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this article makes attention to the continuous need of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express had not included this picture at the time of publication of our article . &quot;
&quot; Greece , 2012 . &quot; &quot; failed . &quot;
&quot; however , there will be tra@@ ded restrictions on the pace of reg@@ att@@ ackers before you will be scre@@ w@@ ling reg@@ att@@ ackers broke down . &quot; &quot; ( warning ! &quot;
the sho@@ cking photo you have ever seen ! ) .
this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed the Nig@@ erian Christians .
this statement was ref@@ uted by a Greek fact check @-@ site 2013 and once in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
an association of the students of theology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim over the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ bing of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ used use of the picture from the DR Congo , with the one hand , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to deli@@ k , since the photos of this were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the government of Myanmar published a position of what they recognized as &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; these riffs , which appeared exclusively in English , includes references to counterf@@ eit pictures of rum@@ ors , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims will kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and one round ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , directed at the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo will NOT show Muslims the Christians kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar has been involved in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought together the story with the image from San@@ ge . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture continues to be included in this publication .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on Stu@@ dents who were killed by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the Catholic B@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ wind@@ y attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ century y@@ or@@ da@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the photo of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , on and extingu@@ ish a discussion among Muslims under the mass@@ acre of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were wondering in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ acres of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages associated with this were taken in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which allegedly had been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , in Um@@ br@@ et , translated it discussion like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message , contained in the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are more confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( inj@@ ecting ) , which are dra@@ gged these po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second F@@ ram@@ ing uses the image to discuss how a African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these pictures longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media there are many people who have un@@ inten@@ tional share , the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ ration it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the back@@ war@@ eness of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the investigation , such as violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss violent representations in the news media , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reports . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly think about situation where a picture suggests something that is actually solved by the context or on completely mis@@ used manner . &quot;
any inspection should also take into account as internationally it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy S@@ imm@@ ons is used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( such as un@@ insur@@ gency ) stri@@ ves to provide voice from words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate at all . &quot;
such words are in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ances stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to create a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist &quot; &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ gun language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ l@@ k &quot; &quot; - sample your parents in recognition of how to make you every effort in your younger years . &quot;
and words in H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi - The convenience or sl@@ oth one feels after spending cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; you disc@@ ern other cultures , un@@ cover other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of these &quot; un@@ riv@@ alled &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; that are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ ings here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is moving with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high @-@ water and terrestrial catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon that usually starts at the end of May , through strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tor@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sl@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) , and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene standards represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water states of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal flight wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ e@@ pl@@ ough crisis , war@@ ns save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus rose up to 6 metres . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday be@@ aten track of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has made five air@@ planes for lif@@ ebo@@ ats and another five will be made for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents closed in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start@@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook sites like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue team for their operations require , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate the dry foods and the necessary goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals in this area need help . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ el will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ sion@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , the Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood relief &quot; key , which allowed the users to call up a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then sent free to the Red Cross Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; similarly , they brought a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful Bo@@ at@@ ement actions for the result of floo@@ ding and vom@@ it @-@ locked people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need to bring in need in need and help Hil@@ fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the people of Sri Lanka now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; using approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in San Francisco at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor in and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the burnt . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next column we conclude rights for Trans@@ actions .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ forests and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head towel high , tied out of an American flag , others sc@@ ru@@ de slo@@ gans against Islam@@ xen@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the cream that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
it de@@ hydr@@ ates me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , to different art . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective idea so as soon as Muslims , who like I will not fit there un@@ cle@@ ars . &quot;
de@@ fo@@ als are being lim@@ ati@@ zed
I am not alone with it alone .
&quot; this is even to be done to the poet , whose poetry in America is selling : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images do you come to mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ Äl@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Qur &apos;an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of its poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion was removed Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists of the induc@@ tion@@ istic pictures of Muslims that has been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture is determined by the dark husband that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid was in the 1970s history behind these pictures .
but these images continue to be continued even today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to bro@@ aden them . &quot;
&quot; I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ u@@ v over@@ shad@@ owed the reality , which have resulted in nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this c@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to bear their head @-@ ro@@ ud in public buildings and covering aci@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group carries out its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil of Afri@@ cans who have been brought with slave vessels here .
it is del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ v ratified our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of antim@@ ony attacks and sli@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell it is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , the religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 billion belong to the 1.@@ 7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell which are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry fails to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion .
and we have failed to make it here where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ isch@@ a@@ lam@@ inated Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that originate from 77 countries .

four decades ago my cat@@ ap@@ ed parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid their first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan reg@@ ained the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ um@@ aded Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now inv@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes when I ask people why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , bring out my hand@@ craft recipes , which all Muslims wear in themselves - &quot; made of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding mus@@ lim schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the running band from a well @-@ trained Islam@@ ism with back@@ ers , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is . or what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and due to the nature , in which we tell them , there is Islam@@ ism in more than just a stran@@ ger who leaves the head of the head . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born , but was born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic church in New York . &quot;
&quot; describing social @-@ scientific religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my muscular faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor to see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the bran@@ ce that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air , which separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ y@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I am in my arms , and her the Arabic verses to protect against the protection of the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; please note that it is protected from evil , evil that one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my muscular faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of you that I slept at this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its complete and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which it can be almost in@@ maneu@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers , which they said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she brought to me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - by a &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ander@@ ter grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan f@@ aded about his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he did not close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , like with my grandfather , by col@@ onists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake risk . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans are all right to four Muslim countries &quot; colonial &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first tile bom@@ b was rejected in front of a century above a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a French , k@@ h@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there was air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means to remind that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed across every continent apart from the Ant@@ arctic , distributed in Iraq to over@@ chase mass destruction of weapons , which are not existing . &quot;
knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ ker are buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means knowing that the su@@ icide rate among Veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is called the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story will report four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that twenty @-@ ten years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , created by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist Muhammad called Bil@@ ali Muhammad is ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed , when people over@@ crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim Brotherhood . &quot;
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life count .
&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a p@@ ah@@ ab@@ i , a p@@ ah@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple bond identi@@ ties , but to fail to re@@ communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ c@@ ist , but is represented in the reduced doubt of &quot; we &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care about my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build upon this branch of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism , in the Muslim registr@@ ars , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer that takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; it consists in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries , which are bombar@@ ded . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; that is largely Arabs and Muslims taking into the visor .
they are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs we throw from Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are now here . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted with the title A@@ scent of Man , the scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically correct image and can assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the s@@ ligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous figur@@ ines we have in our news actions .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry that attempts to grasp our often with binding identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake was , S@@ ay , of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; S@@ ay Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increased Muslim authors to print and MS Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I &apos;m concerned due to this difficult global time , in which we are in . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspir@@ acies that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ ential because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ ential by creating the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years previously it had not been given ; now they dominate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is , but who made me to become an un@@ converted muscle . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ men@@ track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions which makes our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another &quot; &quot; different &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions after the role of being aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as we have no president who had already broken countries and &quot; to others &quot; &quot; humans bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ l@@ kunst wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; story stories , from Flickr @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the result of stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported a short report about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ over@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not affected by T@@ LS but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to maintain and appreciate the variety of variety of cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; the mass die of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , diversity , diversity , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; listening often associated with it is to understand &quot; &quot; Ex@@ erc@@ ing these events instead &quot; &quot; the list@@ ener to appreciate , to make . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent her story first in their own language and translate them in English .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation is that the audi@@ tors enter it . &quot;
they give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of nar@@ ration of nar@@ ration . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the bun@@ nies and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; once he declares the importance of his f@@ Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were aware ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand it . all who are inspired by the project can arrange with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller . &quot;

&quot; we call for a financial test and a leading committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will press and supp@@ resses .

&quot; the Sy@@ ro @-@ Palestinian web@@ developed Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that will be aligned in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publisher of the book &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en excerpts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ ks ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was released last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of paragraphs that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are constructed for free knowledge , and what the real costs are connected with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , designers , researchers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge to look at the fog who surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ a Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence . &quot;
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , has many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we now here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convic@@ tions ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ a was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment , transferred to an unknown site . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ a reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who put themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad government and put it in knowledge from a alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; however , its place of stay and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , played bass plays a crucial role in protecting the Internet access and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the bass , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes were pre@@ viewed than the work that he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civilizations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with hi@@ es@@ ky traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in the digital arche@@ ology and the preservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
portable Bass@@ a could not yet complete this project yet .
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read English well to write and talk .
&quot; he always has shared his knowledge with every one who asked , he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ a has opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also contributed to other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually thought of them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i also wrote the writer of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a Pro@@ claim that she wrote in prison in 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she ornam@@ ents the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he over@@ laid them out of the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is Lic@@ ens@@ freely available .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens when you visit .
&quot; that in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in love in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers matter is , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardians &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
&quot; and I will go into every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
which I am with passion for me
when your eyes are saying Le@@ be@@ well
and I get another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to return all the moments
and to cry over your absence and smile .
I feel overwhel@@ med by myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ haz@@ i :
&quot; a year passed , my soul &quot;

&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
bas@@ ins history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custody since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other men remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption condem@@ nation director at the end of Haf@@ ner returned to previous post .
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with wrath to a corruption , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants because of exp@@ ir@@ sion of 54 million seas ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money from public funds from Mos@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council has stood in Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good management and called for its re @-@ setting in the company , which happened on 19 April then also . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosec@@ utor of the Republic , which exp@@ elled the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za , once again his old post , since the company was not a discipl@@ in@@ ary proceedings according to his custody . &quot;
&quot; however , there are not many inhabitants the action is not good . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle to make the decision of the company , the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a reg@@ ress in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also have a discipl@@ in@@ ary proceedings against the opposing trading .
&quot; however , the company seems to be apparent and prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , rejected this behavior as well as regards the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and that half has been eating . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and to polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has voluntary to become integrated into the company , which he helped damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director does not say any morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the State , because he could not believe him , I can &apos;t believe someone in such a way that the state has already strengthened so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing for morality and serve the state , * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself on the state instead . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state when hand@@ ele has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , that man has become tired , the pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ stra@@ in@@ ers belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , l@@ apping and - next door in said - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the father@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic but he does not alter his ambitions . &quot;
&quot; an ambitious man is simultaneously criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also ongoing :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was free .
&quot; and today , it sets him the company , at which he is money un@@ faithful , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Eff@@ ects others . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and ens@@ ored many users
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ian word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ her@@ se or Sp@@ age . &quot;
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the renowned social network took their po@@ sts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of real @-@ Indian origin or generally as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ed the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or any time , ( in Bur@@ m@@ eric script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of the rise of radical national movements of the word has given an extremely dimin@@ ishing con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight terrorism in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of sensual content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call a speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the use of his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ian words with fundamental different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) or &apos; kal@@ ani &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ nat@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he enth@@ uses the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in spiritual nature , whether she knew his back pain , that he made a word game . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the cargo word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ates is the opinion that they should reduce the radic@@ alist nation@@ alists , but also said that Facebook would be analytical report before there will be all po@@ sts rede@@ em@@ ing in susp@@ ici@@ on , racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you can write on Fac@@ ts .
&quot; what it should do instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the words below . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread , the hate speech , have received a rather good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to circum@@ c@@ ised its nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech may not hold the efficiency of this strategy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords are often a sound and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate described , as Facebook an@@ started to delete his po@@ sts when he was only known to his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is known from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new Directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to receive the lifts , posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards not said . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has removed a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions , or which simply try to show their opinions against hate @-@ hate nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed who has nothing to do with hate :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a soothing intention to have racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and so words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; have forbidden . &quot;
&quot; even as they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to report the fal@@ sely deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million people , giving them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship have taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now writing about Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who had no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ian Text is &apos; I want to sit on a chair and d@@ ut@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out , whether Facebook removed the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to expand social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate @-@ language in social networks should stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been responsible for his failure to talk out , critic@@ ised hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply making the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better running on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the European Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously approved a law which aims to ban this practice so that the saving age now is 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the German law held some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , the brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not inter@@ fere with , as that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention on Human Rights , which is the min@@ ors , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 percent in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statis@@ tical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online Pe@@ ti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements that were eager to prevent laws to children &apos;s before , followed on the foot and looked forward great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader for example had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s to@@ e to say they should , dam@@ n for their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was created for tensions in this really uncomplicated thing , and at some point the opposition came upon whether the opposition would agree to the Legislative Council . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who had been discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where it would already be a simple majority to make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and proc@@ laim the law .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country announced on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again turned again to Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s draft against the children &apos;s escape was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one on it . &quot;
&quot; after it was decided before in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who is a prime minister in the education Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary smell needed , which has lost the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now , and that is almost every price worth it . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to accomplish the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the German law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ly nuts , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
&quot; now , the bare age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independent of the freedom of religion . &quot;
&quot; the draft amending the German law was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives , and there were 35 members of the vote . &quot;
all MEPs who have opposed to have agreed for the law .
the children &apos;s to@@ e is no longer allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ .
many thanks to all activists who have put him up .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a potential hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake court steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to avoid his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General State lawyer Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it is quite right when Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , the majority of social media users would go different from the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , when we place , instead of speaking the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that the state , our daughters of that protects them , that they might be of great , hard @-@ minded men who are likely to be mis@@ used , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legal or continue to the norm , although there are laws that they say . &quot;

since over a month Turkey is now the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
&quot; day after day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and Re@@ porter and fans of TV series are directed against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many techniques have used it used to use environmental tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports about that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er networks ( so calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of a legal ban .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on s@@ napshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus the possibility to read the contents of de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also included that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and only includes screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everybody can use to host similar mirrors pages , if in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ fr@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ fr@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast : &quot;
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
one attacks on another URL that is not the original one . that which one sees is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

a ne@@ pal@@ ean Wild@@ tier@@ i uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos , which he looked around you , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ating him to wear a camera itself and try to settle the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring herself to the international stage at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which direct the attention to Nep@@ als wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook where he helps him this first @-@ class position in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my Father that would be a Leopard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had watched him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ashing pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look like .
and he should know it because he was tigers already from face to face :
a tiger can not inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep not to sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of darkness at home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately asks us , we see ourselves and he ro@@ cking me through the s@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) to his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to make a tiger in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days took it until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look below for some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was dra@@ fted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az , an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was again published here as part of a Content Sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India there are women with the greatest di@@ ligence , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a prono@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social dru@@ cks , as well as fear of the consequences they should be dis@@ regarded as the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a hypo@@ dish , and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of women also not name their wives , too , is widespread also among men . however , they have far less access to fear , if at all , they should not occur in this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club with and became quick to the main table theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , operated by the community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ kh from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they at the same time have made them to amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , was a matter of women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this issue , because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with whom women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; to speak out the name of their hus@@ bands , is a bread@@ too , which they maintain all the liability and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is considered to be deposited as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband to the name until now , at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband seemed to weigh long after the video was at an end .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion sk@@ lu@@ b .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want it means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the bra@@ kes of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise , it was only stra@@ ined ; another decided to let the whole an@@ ed frustration against him and his family by letting him curse . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adrenal@@ ine rush over , having broken down with an ancient bread , decided the women they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands with the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she pun@@ ched , she was afraid and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the galvan@@ ic point on the forehead , which shows the wed@@ ges : &quot;
why do women only show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the galvan@@ ic red spot if he also did it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not come complete with it , but mean to choose them now in a better position , even to choose to carry it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion sk@@ lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on each disc@@ ord . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that women worry , who could hear what could hear , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes , they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things that they never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; for so many years I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have also known about some things , for example , such as our identi@@ ties on our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have lived only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of this is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a broad shirt over a p@@ ants , carry them ; they have not dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of your own clos@@ eness , the mor@@ als linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery Roh@@ ini , their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion sk@@ lu@@ b have already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only taken little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they again listened to the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion sc@@ lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like f@@ eil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or your own clos@@ eness - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

free Bass@@ a : Ne@@ eds Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New@@ n reactions of the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ si@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably not recently made .
this history was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that the democratic reforms in China was involved . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and one speaker says , he did not notice it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this cause with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet , Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully exploited . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; but a spokes@@ man rejected it , however , to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to enable Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and foreign ministers B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway geri@@ es in shock , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government rus@@ hed to have nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon to China since 2010 , as the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; once the message was spreading that Li@@ u was seriously realized , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to cont@@ end his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately by house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on how they divided into an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; we expect at the same time , that China lifts all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us Wi@@ fe as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him , that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in this respect it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary , Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message of the Chinese authorities request , not only Li@@ u , but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the U.S. message attracted an angry answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to inter@@ fere with regard to Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of access and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;

&quot; the German government speakers St@@ eff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin , that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President of Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Law@@ yers Association of New York , the Minister of New York noticed that many people were critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they were compared with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , to rot@@ ate the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , you hear that we ultimately be no land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded as a vul@@ gar , it had a breach of a flight from the responsibilities , a mandatory breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of it , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old corp@@ ses of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be the pre@@ dominant party , leaving the twi@@ sted logic since it fits better into their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , we were given answers to his American guests in terms of our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ answers rational type .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to make his opinion clear , since they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city that belongs to the country ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our aspir@@ ant would take on the trouble to clear this point , provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog published his comment , he points out concerning the reviews that you should begin to read the whole co @-@ ordin@@ ate of the conference so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am better , according to Singapore a city is , and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore is so un@@ even@@ ly important when we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he worked in Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , which makes as a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what was said to the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ rison , which I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is defending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review distor@@ ted the weak spots of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; good @-@ believing &quot; &quot; or was it an Fre@@ ud@@ der speakers ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
if not on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; because he plays an important role within the system of government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am is of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Lon@@ av@@ ant make their military service , they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink human resource ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have been anno@@ yed out many of the av@@ ala ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; defending the country &quot; &quot; etc. but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ placed aspect in your home country or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is posed to me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live back and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite , interest in his contact partner by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then follow the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature &quot; . many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps inn@@ ed in front of anger when they are held for Americans but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans in contrast ... .
&quot; so it was also , when I began to travel around 20 years ago - by Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le blades on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Kan@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I greatly admired . &quot;
it would give me nothing if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some issues with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; firstly : being &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be sk@@ inn@@ y - just like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but tragic , un@@ important figure NE@@ D Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation of people like NE@@ D Fl@@ anders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; does not have personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter . &quot;
inno@@ cu@@ ous to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen to pass . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as going , to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main peculi@@ ar of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters only .
&quot; what outer standing as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; maybe just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au went on stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our prime minister has made Canada to sexy .
musical video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Thailand Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ des , which took place in 2014 , and in spite of their promises to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him which rules makes him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video up@@ loaded Video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times was shared and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist urged the public to watch this video .
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta domination . &quot;
&quot; once again , look at these recordings of the video showing some of the political issues that have been insi@@ sted on some of the political issues that have been insi@@ sted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief decision @-@ making on important national topics . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , its v@@ ague and un@@ clean rules often be exploited by the authorities to activ@@ ist activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , the Online @-@ Cont@@ ents monitors and persons who were thrown , the monarchy will be prosec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ ened but@@ ing against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ Ã¤@@ ts@@ hip ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the law was established .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , their decision would buy expensive U boats , although safety experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax @-@ yellow . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people can be thrown into a black delivery car before they bring them into an interven@@ ing camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they said &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and are threatened with internet users , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ it@@ ated the anoin@@ ting of Pan@@ em , who was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the violin cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ an

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian war has been officially finished , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ th@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ n@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , brown @-@ Asia , Georgian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the biggest part Russians and ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called violin towns in Ab@@ ch@@ ums .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , there were even more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this violin capital . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people had risen over a decade . &quot;
1989 lived about 4@@ 3.000 people in this district .

&quot; that is all a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ u@@ cli@@ des , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling apart and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls him hard to end this .
&quot; this is all a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district . &quot;
in the violin city of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live for about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ icles , which are still one or two families , one recognizes in the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has it forbidden , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend somewhat and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small turquoise @-@ mining companies named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal demand ) like cattle breeding , bee @-@ keeping and vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the District Administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle kur@@ a k@@ ha .
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left in South @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would like to accept no financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are currently nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; is she too . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ alya tells you and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; called T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; you said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what is happening , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ acting in Nat@@ asha , together with her husband and the five common children lived in their house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remind itself of the village of the village .
&quot; despite the relatives , which live in Central Rus@@ land , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ od broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we do not have fear of the dark road or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there were hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were .
when our conversation emerged to the end there is a little boy over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball and then down the hill .
a group children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them have stones on the slo@@ ping building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for un@@ awareness in their lives . &quot;

in Mexico is home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez guides a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org , and is released here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the path of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality will be announced . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is managed by a 5@@ 9@@ - J@@ olds , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ gest@@ el and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy bears form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian ones who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with sto@@ le walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells people in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast you start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mass@@ aging them with a Bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ sta@@ che ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ing .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very affection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston , to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel the circuit together and that the Afri@@ cans are talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many his guides , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil , and has worked as a builder on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa since the months , he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the cri@@ cket after Ti@@ k . &quot;
I ask him whether he will contact Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave it again , &quot; answers he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells you that their guests are often sending text messages , if they are continuing to have her or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was added to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bu@@ zz bu@@ ckets be too expensive for many African immigrants .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ place outside . &quot;
&quot; Valen@@ zu@@ ela , that he knows what the guests are going through . &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; says He . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his job office from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to comp@@ ress money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single @-@ known , has offered him their roof . &quot;
a few months later the family lives still there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses they can consult their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone . &quot;
as a proud grand@@ mother leav@@ ed her in her album with numerous photos .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones a surveillance app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users has been cont@@ ested .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users received a mobile phone notice in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi , in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message will be said that the app &quot; &quot; hin@@ der access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities should also use the app for more than combating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they were , shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police force that the app will determine the sources and the distribution ways of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ont website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ al@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age web pages , from online scam , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to draw attention to users , how much time they spend on @-@ site , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; remote actors or even h@@ ackers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al them . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ored and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet de@@ activ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter @-@ based media outlets &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ( broad@@ casts ) , the chan@@ ed messages published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point , to the polic@@ eman the residents were optional , whether they had the Surveillance App installed . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
make a mobile notification that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a return for technological development .
&quot; they have comp@@ elled the people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of confin@@ ement through the rest of the growing technology .
we are back back in ma@@ os China .
images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( commen@@ cing way ) released also a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus maintain restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the statements of the city council , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , public authorities and institutions , including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , mentioned also these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the Regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; &quot; in local police register . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . however , this action is in@@ jured to the personality right of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible problems , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - part 1 : all scre@@ am after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ est that you &apos;re alone on a place where all the Import@@ ant disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything changed gradually and revealed a truth , which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all glory .
one which has be@@ aten itself in a list of feelings and expressions which don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you &apos;re behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ am after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are resolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the Earth is moving on the axis of the we@@ dge . you become clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested and arrested my father in three times , but that was not so , that I mean &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the safety service , it form@@ atted - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us by doing even the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were moved from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests .
&quot; it left , so that the city occupied the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; all the neighborhoods cov@@ eted , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been sacrific@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply to work in the quarter . &quot;
&quot; I burst the still@@ ness by doing several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; of my house , crying . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence conflic@@ ting .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a beautiful picture , full of my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you will be aware that you free the spirit from the lamp , but you simply do not have you in the Ger@@ ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return to your voice , after you have made it all the way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear like you &apos; Almighty &apos; , or you are only brave enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; and you don &apos;t know what to look in your eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity , and perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause , when I said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I believe I never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in individual , and his father equal with them . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ stri@@ fe of this curse is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; of a spiritual torture which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I per@@ si@@ sts the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I am with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I gave me all the details exactly before I had the space .
otherwise than otherwise they gave me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share it with just one another prisoner , and must immediately put me out immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I handle on an old proven communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; mental det@@ ain@@ ees . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he rep@@ lied to me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a decent man middle age , which looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive fac@@ ets can be seen in me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers connected to his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , she would un@@ f@@ ade him when I stay . &quot;
liar .
I &apos;d like to have had a bird @-@ shy to drive all these cro@@ ws who lab@@ ours in the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear them still &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens up .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of the letter , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ de@@ ur to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent that we occupy the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they talk in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational appearance and ri@@ pped the narrow eye field of its world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse to call the co@@ existence to transform the crime of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I had cared for the audi@@ tor and catch on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , which begin to him , &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than you join this diary and prot@@ esting demonstrations , which will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches after a friendly talk for me to an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; one voice in me said that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished for me , although I had done nothing to earn this sentence . &quot;
an punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably dates from the clo@@ ister .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced on your scre@@ aming .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough , so why they inter@@ changeable the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as trash collectors or whether this was one of the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ woven to us , to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them rarely vary , while I was still in the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard up to cry . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er attracted the cooling , and found no vessel at all , which is why he worked as charity to an electri@@ cally charged . &quot;
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , which lay out of the ground was the perfect black@@ heads . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty to this night .
this must have been around midnight after midnight .
&quot; I decided to put myself again to sleep , say we sometimes , this was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the dawn fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be terri@@ bly worried . &quot;
&quot; be silent and away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they carry me away ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks on the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ af to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine inhal@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity that faces the conservative majority and asks their old well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . all these issues can not only be found in its hom@@ etown Am@@ man &apos;s relevance , but also in cities that vary from Damascus to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a person who is not limited in his mind by boundaries , and he can have compassion on their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not open to the US foreign policy , he has a special incl@@ ination to the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , something to do with his identity as &quot; &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; &quot; - even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think about my own living conditions so , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human , &quot; while he sh@@ ew@@ ed in water , Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramadan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anian law also fails that public consumption is illegal during Ramadan .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot j@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sle@@ eves warm coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ der of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you take a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior of Jord@@ ani@@ ons has announced a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs , who support the Islamic State of Action - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts Ham@@ ed nonsense , which contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tab@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former pres@@ idents of the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the S@@ kan@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; many also claim the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a promoted the j@@ ord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; that continues to be decided on an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be simply not simply rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but indeed a more evident in the cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will have traditional gender standards to Lei@@ be by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vor@@ tices sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly lower @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch out into the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them .
in the past years in Jordan the number of &apos; volunte@@ ered &apos; has increased the in@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary President in 2016 achieved its peak ; however , it is still terri@@ fied that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of mor@@ ale or domestic violence , to be appropriate . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime against the year 1954 , women who are imprison@@ ed in the danger of domestic violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee by the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is known for this , not to withdraw from subjects that are long as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ref@@ uted that his work is political , however , is that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I became a policy to me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are at the core of the core , can continue . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which you can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality by LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were greatly sed until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were turned out of the context and had been c@@ ens@@ ed in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube there was up@@ loaded without cuts , but there was only a edited version , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which is still alive today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks for himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can I not leave Jordan ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic news service took several former government officials and members of the teaching network , with the reason@@ ing ; they had expressed cri@@ tically on comments in social media which coinci@@ ded with the deep within the country which were deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s view is according to the top of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian paper . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s progress for him is progress for continuous giving and taking . Jordan has res@@ c@@ ated Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is of slow , careful and internal change . it is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately dre@@ amed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs also , from a Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he did not only dreams of his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will rejoice with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stretching and artificial style . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , the A@@ man as Student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war pu@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; we assumed that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of to@@ g@@ us . another theory was ra@@ ked out , in the armies from the west of Japan into the Nor@@ theast mar@@ ched in order to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mi@@ hi , to its knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to pick up some great seats , so we have a super view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two land@@ cars are straight to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I saw the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fortress was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote an legitimate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road consuming and illegal drugs stores are all daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts discuss each other in order to show who from them can create the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( see more videos about current competitions on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to see young people in their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice on a training in the hair@@ style art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and present opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in front of March and reported about some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only university school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because from love to children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare

use with kind permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the post &quot; &quot; love message to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler &quot; , &quot; which released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love @-@ letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel fully equipped with affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people to do so , guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare . &quot;
&quot; only recently was their land sw@@ ings of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was considered the sub@@ sign of the peace treaty than so important , that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Kolum@@ bi@@ ans , there is a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , who have lived in illegal camps for many years and have been exposed to war @-@ rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock , they must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , they must now take up into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans would close together and help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare in order to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that are to be given personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in Bogot@@ Ã¡ . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day of love letters , but those who forget that they need much unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told , he told this year his love with people who need the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; in this way the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who will now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolum@@ bi@@ ens such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I had never thought , that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogot@@ a traveled in the camp to im@@ part the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were on how they had done before to vali@@ date the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very turbulent moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; told the policy @-@ knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , describe this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ clu@@ es &quot; &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare ) saw , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear , go up , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ som , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ n . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answered on a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so nice , so I answered on it . suddenly the tears went over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; maybe he was also the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; &quot; I had never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society without waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all raised up as a war and the F@@ ARC already recorded in the dark .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years ago we have experienced how the social injustice they had to develop into a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this size order it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never found hearing and no voting right , and to recognize that people who are often seen as mon@@ ster and even hate people who were turned by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but I comfor@@ ted that all men - even those who are killed and so much damage we can teach us , and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Kolum@@ bi@@ ans was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament peace will reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to protest to the weapons and to protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now put on peace , a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call on all def@@ ender of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ macro @-@ owa and its first publication on the OC Media .
&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
with hor@@ rors they have experienced the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of sul@@ try men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on how a D@@ amo@@ is worth hanging over the village of LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only over night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after several months ago , after reports published , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic of the discussed . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta , and cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ icious que@@ er men strongh@@ olds and them in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for their lives , she moved to the USA in the final analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer work in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acquain@@ tance from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ wife , who put into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he was a friend of whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so , there is no men anymore in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ rup@@ tions ? &quot;
after that we made the photos of my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping chairs from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time at the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke in the hospital at the end of the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry .
the man was flow@@ n .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two view@@ points in my right wing .
OC Media : in which hospitals have you been placed - in the men or the women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I am very grateful for him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ au@@ cas@@ k name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good human being .
I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a alpha@@ bet .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they placed absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by passing above without the roads . others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny , that all my sex was not changed , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bas@@ kets size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot stir you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed himself a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with a dark windows and a number@@ mer@@ n@@ schild with a 95 dr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; after it was happened for the third time , I became clear that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends sur@@ rendered the numerical signs ; it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flow@@ n ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I will not give her name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the land , but then something happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without having to register without notice , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a foreig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not think , you are in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ lick . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality . however , this is a tobacco topic . &quot;
some traditionally k@@ au@@ cas@@ tic elements I still wear in me .
&quot; so very much I would like to do it , this past@@ oral barrier can not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I am always saying that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look at the person who remember her past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I received a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has spent one and a half months in the gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ramadan had no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood recovery . &quot;
OC Media : are now still gay men into this secrecy ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said , there would be not very many . &quot;
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives , or have been dropped by their relatives , in order to make a cad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should it be brought to them , they will show their bodies on television and claim , they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically under@@ ed to radi@@ alize . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just had someone to det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there has since then nothing new of them .
they have it simply taken .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was even taken care of when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . we suppose that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you have not allowed to shave these people to shave ?
&quot; know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wor@@ e my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 I was already known all over the world , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it is now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to bring us back to the &quot; &quot; civilian isation &quot; , &quot; but finally we returned to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were packed ; I had colored lashes , carried the tube , and short t@@ ops . &quot;
the Security Department of Sh@@ aria has never stir@@ red me only one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people there . &quot;
we have never been spar@@ ed .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mption : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is called &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the un@@ happiness of another .
&quot; it is often said to children , if people are funny about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never denied me to never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ ation held ?
Sab@@ rina : for as long as Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed to Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how the people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iles and logged in , behold you upon a time with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily wor@@ sen@@ sed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I didn &apos;t get a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , arri@@ vals , I beg@@ s them to the hospital and help them to get ess@@ ays . &quot;
I do not have a pen@@ ny for it .
I discovered these people myself as I rested from the flu@@ x .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you bear an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ves .
&quot; thus , nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to proph@@ es@@ y you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no s@@ aut@@ Ã© with them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ines have , the Russians also have whatever ; on the entire planet , there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan - live with men together .
&quot; know many think about drinking identity to men who love men , and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , in order to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancestors community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; for the past few months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August rejected the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ id@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered with anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful for his own assistance to be able to pay the in@@ capacity to his family , such as ancestors human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video held the moments , after having remembered by himself . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly managed to delete the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only self @-@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and campa@@ ign@@ ers on site to warn that even more men might take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ster Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family father@@ less , who felt thanks to persecution on the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and follow a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community settled , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to pun@@ ish their living . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and in 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most powerful and most valuable areas for agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the local population gets little of that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied the ancestors of the ancestors , systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youth now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General Direc@@ torate for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished a job , completed the primary school , 55 % a secondary school and 45 % university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist eth@@ ni@@ cal discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ himi said that especially unemployment has become more and worse . reason for this , a combination of a high number of ancestors in Ah@@ wa@@ z is emerging from anti @-@ Arab discrimination and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since functionality and institutions does not preferred Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their pros and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancestors , as even Arab names in the workplace will not be tolerated , as the speaking of the Arabic language or the Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi have to end@@ ure , human rights activists are alarm , before the location is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I am not using femin@@ ism identification , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ids Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al fem@@ inists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they put even well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come in various areas of life on a gl@@ ass@@ ed ceiling , and that discrimination is moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced that I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black transi@@ ent women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I talk about what kind we are physically , se@@ el@@ ically and verb@@ ally used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all agree that women - all women - come together to up@@ lift &quot; their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institu@@ tion@@ alized form of racial @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed black women on a two @-@ fold manner . &quot;
&quot; in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres , and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all human beings have neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not connect myself as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands to consider un@@ righteous , un@@ righteous people in their thinking that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of one person . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ zed sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly rejected . &quot;
&quot; said Ms 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alised being in the historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to connect to group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b@@ ate through cultural events , our customs and customs , to advance its ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women the importance of temp@@ ting of skin colour and sex . for some of them will continue to silent the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different sources for a home and limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , still lies the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself full and completely from femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman , which is so obst@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now , it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which we are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author in the book of Afri@@ cana wom@@ ens : Rec@@ laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blos@@ som@@ ing in an environment in which my life is neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ del@@ ate against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a over the past 7 years - mostly with Surf@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution by his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the flow we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; to fear scientists from all over the country that the decades of war , the construction of dust removal , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al journalist , filmed , filmed and published . &quot;

Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women &quot; represents the cri@@ es women &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft bottle ) that reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
&quot; a police Com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its Ex@@ partner who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time passed and the police spoke , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out , also the ak@@ eable display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez is nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved their display . &quot;
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women only refund an ad in general , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they mis@@ ses . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 stro@@ kes and statistics of the 2 Un@@ invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which is nothing subordin@@ ated 3 Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , def@@ icient implementation of beats and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really mis@@ ses , &quot; says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research for geni@@ uses at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however the figures available are however alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the district of the District Office 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads were given by women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts . here 86 % of the ads came from women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women spoke that they were physically distr@@ acted , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic failures . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s mini@@ stered in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; on every woman who re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mi@@ stress display , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman who re@@ funded due to physical exercise , come two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own crime , the law enforcement authorities cannot be appropriately documented how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
only until August 2016 journalists had at least 12 cases of wom@@ an@@ su@@ icide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman because of violence through men . &quot;

invisible mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning they did not want it , but then , to . this should be rep@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer combined with Carlos . but two years she carried the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognis@@ able the most severe recognizable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would be victims of abuse .
&quot; if I read earlier about it , I always thought that that only women happens to be fool@@ ed , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the failure of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people rep@@ lied to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever had raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and left him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of ini@@ quity have at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos that originates from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner will mis@@ lead them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ical abuse .
&quot; your prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince them , they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partners who developed into an in@@ scrut@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path of resi@@ stor@@ s and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed a bill that was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # inter@@ viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the original draft of the law looks before Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case .
&quot; thus the law@@ lessness was changed in some points , in order to also win the MEPs for the law that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions may be prohibited , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to provide most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which have to pay the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to report and get a safe accommodation to place the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot;
in Paraguay it is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ membran@@ ce must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who , in view of these facts , does not guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must refund as long as this is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law have been changed , including a passage , which the partners in cases of domestic violence was called reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been viewed as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a large envelope . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to be exposed to the prohibition of a newspaper .
&quot; this website has been blocked due to a resolution of the information Minister , on the homepage of the promised newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison where he is a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but later came back again . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , having his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a State . &quot;
&quot; since then , he suffers from his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important ministries in the country : Prime Minister , Secretary of Defense , Secretary of Minister , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domin@@ ance of the Sult@@ an is characterized by the per@@ si@@ tional efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country as well as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported by the authorities in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; bind the hands of justice . in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report of government officials , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man have put under pressure to raise a judgment in a inheritance of inheritance . &quot;
&quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i MEP , Member of the Board of Directors , sent from the ISS to the Special Department and transferred on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS visited the Vice @-@ Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who has been working after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Fest@@ ing as the editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; the paper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information Minister had given the directive that &quot; &quot; the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in mas@@ kat took place the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and or@@ da@@ ined the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were judged among other things because of the distur@@ ban@@ ces of the public order , &quot; misuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a crowd of audience and decay .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year arrest and money pun@@ ching in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition a one @-@ year profession offered against the two journalists .
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a prison sentence of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of a information network to the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the custody . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ al Court spoke Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months of prison . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dismis@@ sed in prison on 10 April 2017 according to the exp@@ ulsion of his six months prison sentence . Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is holding his one @-@ year prison . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information on , the &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ am@@ n , the paper looks after attack by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information sent a directive with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Justice personally signed a further assignment in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister presented itself again against the decision of the appeal to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n , and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only instances in which in O@@ man have been in@@ jured the press freedom in recent times . &quot;
&quot; for other violations , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent Online Newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the comprehensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
the Golf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally free of release ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go up to their job ; &quot;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all circumstances to ensure human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man are imp@@ lic@@ ated their legal human rights work , and without fear of understanding , including judicial sliding measures . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf Region and the right to gather peace@@ fully , supported and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with his consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the supply of the global health system many medicines and vaccines that meet the specific medical need for the African continent . &quot;
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , when building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Central Bank in the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he found himself on HIV virus that decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡@@ mi health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and mis@@ concep@@ tions about the media on this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er r@@ w : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the SÃ¡@@ mi national program for Anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; furthermore , a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the most important academic topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only place solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be receiver , instead of being made M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often in our surroundings not well used , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how great your opinion is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students of all age groups .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , Big Data , research of the Cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ms , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa opposite western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , there are the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that periodic@@ als articles make available only on payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the site En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton bred in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ t , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in Space . &quot;
&quot; nearly 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only by his own accident and the question , how many sal@@ ads can get , limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them to breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents have not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green @-@ tone or d@@ inning leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as cere@@ als or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and Expert for food security around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mor@@ ton was still salad , he now needs to be more and more difficult for this work . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock @-@ bro@@ cks to whom I must p@@ umped . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go on sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed any new sal@@ ine sor@@ ties because all features are patented , so good as possible and tried to raise the characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use any material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also attached a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Centre ISS have bred red tube sal@@ at in the &quot; green@@ houses &quot; of the station and eaten . there it is tested whether plants cultivated in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that , when the movement originates from the IT @-@ sector , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyrighted software . &quot;
it was sum@@ mon@@ ed to ensure that some plant species and sal@@ aries are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeding .
&quot; in the context of the initiative , in short Ossi , U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can use the seeds of seeds freely . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders only permit others to breed their seed , to cross its own varieties , and it is not immediately visible - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant @-@ processing . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Ossi @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds also plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to utilize the latter or just a little by raising seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes , that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetables , grain , GM , or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who want to purchase our objective of ecological sustainability , &quot; &quot; he says and participates in the increasingly more frequently @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way it is bred based on how this vegetables are bred . &quot;
&quot; nutri@@ tion@@ ality without seed @-@ sensitivity is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others their seed , and thus their approach will be pat@@ ched in contrast , seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available recovery pool due to becoming increasingly numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is thus always restricted , un@@ enc@@ um@@ hr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Ossi , has been employed in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation at car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ els are protected as intellectual property , thus making it available for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspected that mass @-@ built plants like wheat are patented in a larger scale as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - of such , through which their taste or colour increases until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder caused by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker at Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining the gene@@ tical diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts the opinion that Int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual Property store other bre@@ eder , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can abide as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others come to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bits innovations not , but promotes them by the public provided more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , but certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you need to wait for a long time to grow , to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the battle would have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton , however , that genetic resources always have been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton refers to the concept to pat@@ enting the material characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants are up to them themselves , and as breeders , we finally have no idea of how the plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of crop breeding : &quot; &quot; who bred a variety , also bred its own values into it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ ok@@ ultur@@ es believed to grow in their varieties of farming this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very rainy . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such who are moving to international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders &quot; Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bre@@ eder caused by the A@@ void of plant patients &quot; innovative &quot; : &quot; it looks like I am producing my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent , one is 20 years ago protected against competition , which makes it very nice simply . &quot;
&quot; while the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . the center with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties to meet specific requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come in &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agreement , an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding different from country to country , absent from the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conventional plants allowed . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation still is not a law ; now it is possible to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all East Africa in order to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems &quot; that the organization currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start@@ up . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ return development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the future of food - a combination of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . in this , it represents that farmers may have the opportunity to co @-@ operate and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von Ossi that will soon see him more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the latest goals for the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities un@@ lock content on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government conducted the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network released a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and said that continue working and effort for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Rem@@ ove - despite this attack and the spot@@ ting of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities , whom the law has to defend itself , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these goals . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these goals and not admit it . we insist on to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt since the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web pages , as e.g. the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that from Qatar &apos;s network of al J@@ aze@@ era because of &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to Egypt on the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of Kolum@@ ns and articles , which he does not write in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now , the blog which he set up to handle the c@@ ens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ ggers , which is native to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is also accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student prot@@ este and a video recorded , as the police had physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article focuses primarily on politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the block@@ age of the blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to im@@ itate me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; a arrest , a attempted murder , pre @-@ loading with national Security Council , the block@@ ers of blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I have not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small public . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 web sites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the block@@ age of providers , through the implementation of internet ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the block@@ age of websites , which V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and filtering on the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation will additionally be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ ored choices are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal basis so that they can go against this action against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they be next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day for day report newspapers in whole Brazil with d@@ ash head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day is murdered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ ked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air was@@ hers to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of wave in Rio reached the highest stand for ten years . &quot;
the Brazilian organisation Global Justice approved even the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the article published for the detailed report on violence in Rio known &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; was not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex , etc . all , which happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio , is published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes before the atro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , explained Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war in a country , which does not recognize the war at all . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are according to indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial article the paper writes on :
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ discourse , if he is distor@@ ted , even so , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to forgive . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ si@@ l argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , to call the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibilities in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - how extra in the analysis of military rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ confident negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

Rio de Janeiro is known as &quot; the most violent town in Brazil &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia it is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 to the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current data available .
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the M@@ ord@@ ry per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the biggest media company of South America , that empha@@ sizes how Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia has been repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; at these safety measures also included the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in the year 2003 , whose aim is to conquer an Fav@@ ela by using a massive police officers . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death inci@@ dents . for some years the U@@ PP have been protected about ra@@ can@@ es and repression against the poor communities who should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the human being . &quot;
&quot; for this is calling for the state to use the means and ways that are typical of a war . this is an intru@@ sion in the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ damages &quot; and &quot; conce@@ aled bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war hin or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas suffer from Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week it is now that the police have er@@ ted the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , there was also this incident head@@ lines , an orch@@ ard died due to shots that the police had folded from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly strongly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons announced on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of the Assad regime has been practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebels , controlled territories outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to residents on the right or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food and meat have become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ se@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , reproductive foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged Ost Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the direct part of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been campa@@ ign@@ ing for three years , and expressed his relief from that it wins now more and more &quot; on famili@@ arity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative we use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ den@@ da the humanitarian Cro@@ w@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the pl@@ anting of mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
because of fuel scar@@ city locally produced fuel fuel from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; &quot; production of the regions of fung@@ al &quot; &quot; before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . as this was managed , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; teaching &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distributed free of charge everywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach men the mushroom pic@@ ni@@ cation for various reasons &quot; : split of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; dissemination of a culture of self @-@ supply , by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege are visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis @-@ areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

they call for justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested during the 21st of October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that occurred in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
&quot; two hundred and forty persons died , and approximately 70 were in@@ jured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state @-@ term . &quot;
fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires out@@ breaks , spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande occurred in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest@@ ry surveillance system that monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite recording , in Portugal alone in Portugal about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the Situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the State .
people asked why civil protection was not able to penet@@ rate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al from the league of the farmers of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o roads and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; this Sunday did they do this nowhere : there are d@@ utz@@ fold reports of open streets , which were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the streets were very late . &quot;

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

&quot; during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short@@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an for the last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother said it then not so , she knew she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dom@@ ed party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban ever came closer to their hate to the Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara abandoned the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
several days after his run A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made it sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his minor wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a strange country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sa@@ ws with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than he himself to make himself his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of af@@ gh@@ ing refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in a le@@ er@@ standing building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we p@@ ylon n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we will not fres@@ hen up at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af survived his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
&quot; during the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he suffered ship and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal to the need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for distr@@ ust asylum seekers , but it is true also that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Code Union for Europe writes the system itself under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special entrance centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised , in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be shared with an entrance center if they officially added a request for asylum - which can move after the registration of asylum seekers or monthly . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unc@@ row@@ ful life @-@ angle helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af grew its entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and a schn@@ el@@ li@@ mb@@ iss .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; too much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of them were created by Afgh@@ ans , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ etto restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells us about the different af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y sector , and retailers come back to the country that he had to leave as teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can not live happily if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af wro@@ ught plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seriousness on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end they are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ eds report : de@@ fi@@ ers from Egypt allow off @-@ off social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearance of Rab@@ a &apos;a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ eds report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament has reviewed a draft law , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook , only after registration in a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users need to be able to use social networks within six months after the most successful legislation on the website of the authority , under specification of their full name and its use number . &quot;
whoever dre@@ amed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison or perpet@@ ration of a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members , is currently the legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Commission proposal would be introduced to the tougher pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or of a senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ulting of the President as well as state institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law proposal , such an act would act with pr@@ isons and money pun@@ ching , so right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in detention of the world . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when it demonstrated by Egyptian police officers , which led to the military put@@ sch , which led to the President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan be waiting for more than 700 Protest@@ ants who have been arrested in the same incident , four years in detention to a court . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May , because the pr@@ isons to human rights groups was strengthened by the accused , to bring the accused of prison in the court room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan face the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree , the hypo@@ burden of inter alia ceas@@ eless meeting , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribunal spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si cour@@ si@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to sc@@ anned documents
&quot; in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ pol@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly listening to a sc@@ anned Plan of Action Plan , which was specifically supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan specifically granted a control law , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused officials of Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that these all @-@ right @-@ preserved funds will return . &quot;
&quot; this document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the disclosure of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press code which journalists ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to submit their ID .
&quot; according to new rules of the information office of the Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media information in China before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will be required with the full real name . &quot;
analy@@ st suggests that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities use these regulations .
Chinese ret@@ ters suggested in social media to enforce these regulations only to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and its independence .
then we will see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russian access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or dre@@ amed We@@ chat , to register with the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the information distribution &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is conducting a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law allows the government to make responsible for removing content and force them on request for adoption of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mailing , and d@@ utz@@ ing of other services . &quot;
turquoise dish also has Wikipedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the block@@ Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ den@@ es refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime Affairs and Communication had been blocked , the side had been blocked because it operates to &quot; a source of information that cooperates with groups to prevent a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely . it is thus , besides amongst others China , one of the few countries worldwide , where the access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can not stop her@@ b@@ out
&quot; following this week the government of Great Britain is in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased monitoring funds , which would force the Internet service provider to monitor communication in real time and to install back@@ door programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encrypted . &quot;
&quot; the government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services relating to the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from the members of the public can be forwarded to the Office of the Office . &quot;
