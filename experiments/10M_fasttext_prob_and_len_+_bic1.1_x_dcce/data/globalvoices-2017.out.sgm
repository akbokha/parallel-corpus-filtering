<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation grew up with American films, American authors have read and engaged in American music, American authors and his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14-years I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-Students, who were the highest Bundescourt with judges, who were inclined his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the US."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me as he is surrounded by its bottling.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague put it put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes that he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number, which was ever achieved by the party of the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigotte person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and his voters to tune with people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, the people from all over the world increases, a deep glitant man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps worldview not coincide with the name of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to look at the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits with the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those affected by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump's journey to nominee republican presidential, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly pastes, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt to non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either share his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump's voters as Rassisten.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people," "said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which are most white, for Trump voted, because they would like to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who reviews the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Whitelash" (Anm. WC.: as much as "dence of the White against all other ethnicities;" word game of white in attack on the whites and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as was the Great Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is definitely welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenians, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas for this promise and says: to hell with multiple, religious freedom, and all the concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"for all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who liked in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, could have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the amount answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brood the crowd. "</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" I answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drugs misuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hopelessness."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez recalls a local ecologist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearsing and we had to teach at the same place, at which the parents worked in the trash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that battles wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this paper, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, that the ship had already been operated in lireported waters illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore raised and little inclined to welcome a legislative crusher of this species to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they mourned to him, one of their harbors and refuse to give him a fishing activity."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply remember anything," "reminds of Benedict Kiilu, a leading annexation of the Kenyan fishing authority. it is part of a team who discovered the ship time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then distributed out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which criminalizes criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries, which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" in this way we have eight countries who are like sinned and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to read, because it is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the intentional abuse of existing laws, through which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem harm, which have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail, with the information between individual countries, so these actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can share with each other for example lists the existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one could notice or experience during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in botanical areas. also, such suspicious routes can be found - about such, which suggest that a ship invites its frozen fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the Idealcase, such investigations can indicate whether the participating ships were a fishing license where they were on the way, and possibly also whether they have a crime."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can deny the adoption of such ships in their harbors. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to numbers from penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it then comes to significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing fishing does not mean more financially."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose eight members of the HISH network every year due to the illegal fishing network that penetrate into eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa is one of the most productive tuna fishing plants, absent for the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. under these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"practices such as actions count as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, stating fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they specifically use the lack of international co-operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-organised control system, "" says Long. "" earlier, a ship could be illegally fish and a country could then say 'you daring my port not to run'. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and just this legale hatchhole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH was involved in more than 30 studies.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks to spread the counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships, who used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the International Authority on combating crimes, FISH can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system, which is to help the FISH-i, suspicious ships of accurate ships."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to enhance the illegal ships who like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example its automatic identification systems, which cannot be orated with more of satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system which connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal, criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has recently opened with Google and the Sea Protection Organization Oceana, the platform Global Fishing Watch opens: a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position can be displayed around the world."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - this is simply meaning, "" says he. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable trust has a similar project to run, in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but they also detaintly."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have used earlier without licence, and barely expected to count on consequences, they now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH associates have now recorded a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats, has since buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 had set up, the inspectors found there on board troppry, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing annually."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries closed there for six countries, so called West Africa Task Force, and now fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country of Somalia its first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used in tow, which meanwhile are prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was even penetrated into botanical waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take-of standards against Greko 1, the a strong sign that they pass against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentations have recently agreed to a lawdraft for the regulations regarding use of use and utility of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">"if he is accepted by the Parliament, commercial users and users need to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up, which is charged to give citizens a permission to give social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, commercial users would have to register on the site with their right names and personnel numbers in order to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it is dreamed to do so, this could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a cash buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six paragliding, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt independent, the social media is running and used to communicate with others by means of voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced, as the draft no indication of how Egyptian authorities must impose upon registration and users who are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentations and Patrons of the Legislative Council, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users, and users received a username and password to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians, information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">Yet it is not known so far that such plans are there.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical with regard to the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" leading research technology ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">"I really doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology."</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they feel that just as they could be ridden on physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"when I take it seriously, then that means they can enroll a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who have a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary session."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance will be successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in which the control is maximized and ensures that no deviating scration on the image is present," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countries Fukushima and Iwate were forced out, because the tsunami had vanished all coastal cities of the map. "</seg>

<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of Japanese reconstructions as well as survey results of those affected by itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (commenced, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata were completed."</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>

<seg id="720">The customers see themselves these plastic meals and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>

<seg id="722">"in the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small businesses that manufacture the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago documented."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports and foreign media on the infamous" fight against drug trading "in Mexico, the misses and fetching regularly only dive in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle with itself."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Zaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there are hardly any one looking at the sadness or the congregations who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"standing behind each body, behind every bone report in the hundreds of married tombs, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never be heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "with the drug market" ") to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if business close because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities therefore need many kilometres to buy something such as milk."</seg>

<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "like fear life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"one main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is married each weekend tombs to his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father in just one day, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew."</seg>

<seg id="771">"you are standing in the insurance of my Father, but that does not get them out, because they require a mortgage."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and government leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in the high risk of risks.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never look as normal, regardless of what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have now know illness and sensation journalism now for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come over every day to newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with pictures, which actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the inhaled or sad. it acts like a lack of respect for the person who had once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be invalid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) will be if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is, as would they tempt those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories about mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatelessness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring village be justified that they were settled.</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to speak that they remain spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirred and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" four months of extortion in the main city distributions: how a family with threats was looted. in this, it describes how armed crime month for month money from their business, until they ended not only the business, but also their family apart.

<seg id="792">"the pain also goes by never, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again if you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, telephone numbers also."</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are away, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">They included their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will guide you or to kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, whether wines would solve my deep-root feelings, but the answers is no, because I have forgotten how to cries. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence signed.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a guard and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cooks that makes potatoes warm and "Chichi" for the babies which is with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water, sugar and milk pulsing. "</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">"however, they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been over two years before, when he saw a few blocks from his home, the bloody lyche of his father had been shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders for public safety and government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Public Prosecutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundred thousand-thousand stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories still live in the face of new headlines. this project reminds us of those we have not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "has launched a project journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the sharpened struggle against drug trading, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in intelligible manner."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>

<seg id="823">But there will be questions about our desire for pictures on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a petrol station sailed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. in doing so, 230 people came alive."</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example for that.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of disguised bodies based on the ground up while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo was captured several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and may not be attributed to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>

<seg id="852">One step further bring personal comments such as this example may be misdiagnosed the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the renowned social network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of real-Indian origin or generally as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censed the word" Kalar "or any time, (in Burmeric script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of the rise of radical national movements of the word has given an extremely diminishing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight terrorism in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call a speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the use of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burian words with fundamental different meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair at Burmically also 'Kalar htaing' written, which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar Pae '(Spage) or' kalani '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknater Aung Kaung Myate declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he enthuses the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in spiritual nature, whether she knew his back pain, that he made a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the cargo word (la) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>

<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hates is the opinion that they should reduce the radicalist nationalists, but also said that Facebook would be analytical report before there will be all posts redeeming in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you can write on Facts.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the words below."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar Pae "(Spage)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists spread, the hate speech, have received a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to circumcised its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech may not hold the efficiency of this strategy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords are often a sound and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myate described, as Facebook anstarted to delete his posts when he was only known to his friends that the word 'Kalar' is known from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to receive the lifts, posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community standards not said."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions, or which simply try to show their opinions against hate-hate nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed who has nothing to do with hate:</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a soothing intention to have racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and so words such as" chair "or" inheritance curry "have forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even as they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried not to report the falsely deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million people, giving them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship have taken care of a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now writing about Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been responsible for his failure to talk out, criticised hate speech on his Burmese pages under control."</seg>

<seg id="1475">"the tradition of women also not name their wives, too, is widespread also among men. however, they have far less access to fear, if at all, they should not occur in this practice."</seg>

<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to cover practices, such as children's heikh from HIV- and AIDS infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they at the same time have made them to ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, was a matter of women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this issue, because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with whom women can easily identify."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to speak out the name of their husbands, is a breadtoo, which they maintain all the liability and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is considered to be deposited as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of the Rohini, who had never called her husband to the name until now, at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband seemed to weigh long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started its first discussion sklub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want it means that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the brakes of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise, it was only strained; another decided to let the whole aned frustration against him and his family by letting him curse."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush over, having broken down with an ancient bread, decided the women they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands with the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she punched, she was afraid and said that there was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said:" "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the galvanic point on the forehead, which shows the wedges:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the galvanic red spot if he also did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not come complete with it, but mean to choose them now in a better position, even to choose to carry it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion sklub is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip on each discord."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make sure that women worry, who could hear what could hear," says she. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes, they danced and sang and spoke about things that they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"for so many years I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have also known about some things, for example, such as our identities on our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have lived only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of this is the okay, but some wanted a saline-Kurta, a broad shirt over a pants, carry them; they have not deceived."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of your own closeness, the morals linked to the Saris and much more, jewellery Rohini, their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion sklub have already changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only taken little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they again listened to the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion sclub know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like feiling for more freedom of movement or your own closeness - at the end of a hard to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the incarcerated Chinese Dissidents Liu Xiaobo had attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for" Subversion "(state risk) after the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China was involved."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China has called Lius case as" an internal matter, "and one speaker says, he did not notice it as" "not required to discuss this cause with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China continues to call up calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet, Liu Xia, release or give it a treatment abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon to China since 2010, as the exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"once the message was spreading that Liu was seriously realized, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Lawyers Association of New York, the Minister of New York noticed that many people were criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they were compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, to rotate the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable country, you hear that we ultimately be no land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded as a vulgar, it had a breach of a flight from the responsibilities, a mandatory breach."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of it, he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old corpses of the authoritarian rulers appear to be the predominant party, leaving the twisted logic since it fits better into their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the last week of Shangrgam, we were given answers to his American guests in terms of our press, our Judictative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarded with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to make his opinion clear, since they did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city that belongs to the country..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our aspirant would take on the trouble to clear this point, provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"on the blog published his comment, he points out concerning the reviews that you should begin to read the whole co-ordinate of the conference so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam better, according to Singapore a city is, and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is rather a" city "as a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore is so unevenly important when we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He worked in Singapore with cities in the U.S. (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously does not have it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes as a leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am about what was said to the Minister of Justice of Singapore,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew about Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old garrison, which I expect - whether I agree with them or not, but this is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review distorted the weak spots of Shangrgams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam" "good-believing" "or was it an Freudder speakers?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be regarded as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"because he plays an important role within the system of government, the statements of Mr Shangrgam is of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Lonavant make their military service, they defend only their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resource?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have been annoyed out many of the avala...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "defending the country" "etc. but this is not quite true."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"then follow the default answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, Nature ". many Canadians cook perhaps inned in front of anger when they are held for Americans but don't disturb it."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1767">There are also some issues with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"firstly: being" "nice" "is basically to be skinny - just like the benevolent, gentle, but tragic, unimportant figure NED Flanders from" "Simpson" "(which has one's own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation of people like NED Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "does not have personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing in which you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Innocuous to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen to pass."</seg>

<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- Jolds, a small woman with a corals pink Brillengestel and gold-colored earrings in Teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian ones who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with stole walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs Ramírez, tells people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast you start to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston, to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the track, "" Felix Michelet, a Guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and the Africans often travel the circuit together and that the Africans are talking on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many his guides, Michelet has lived in Brazil, and has worked as a builder on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Championship."</seg>

<seg id="1930">I ask him whether he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave it again," answers he smiling. "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs Ramírez tells you that their guests are often sending text messages, if they are continuing to have her or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter was added to Valenzuela and his family immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the buzz buckets be too expensive for many African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment are 25 people there, mainly Haitian."</seg>

<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his job office from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>

<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a single-known, has offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones a surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter-users has been contested.</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile users received a mobile phone notice in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi, in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message will be said that the app" "hinder access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities should also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh Women in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they were, shortly after they had installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police force that the app will determine the sources and the distribution ways of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwont website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system-categories for children and adults, introduced by Jialu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blockage web pages, from online scam, Trojans and phishing sites to draw attention to users, how much time they spend on-site, and to control your own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "remote actors or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or to steal them."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censored and monitoring measures as well as routinely Internet deactivations."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"on Twitter-based media outlets" images from Mainland China "" (broadcasts), the chaned messages published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint, to the policeman the residents were optional, whether they had the Surveillance App installed. "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">Make a mobile notification that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"they have compelled the people to use devices, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of confinement through the rest of the growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back back in maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Images from Mainland China "(commencing way) released also a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus maintain restricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the provisions in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the statements of the city council, to minimize the spread of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, public authorities and institutions, including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office in operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>

<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the dawn fills the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youths:" "my Lord, my Father must be terribly worried."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and away you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they carry me away?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks on the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free speech and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside; sometimes he loaf to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine inhaled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years, Hdaib is a passionate activity that faces the conservative majority and asks their old well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees. all these issues can not only be found in its hometown Amman's relevance, but also in cities that vary from Damascus to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not limited in his mind by boundaries, and he can have compassion on their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he is not open to the US foreign policy, he has a special inclination to the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, something to do with his identity as" "Palestinian refugees" "- even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think about my own living conditions so," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human, "while he shewed in water, Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanian law also fails that public consumption is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot jitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sleeves warm coffee and the Schwader of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you take a look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior of Jordanions has announced a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs, who support the Islamic State of Action - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed nonsense, which contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tabs."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former presidents of the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the Skaners."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism, which represents the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila promoted the jordanian people as" progressive supporter of human rights "that continues to be decided on an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be simply not simply rhetoric, but indeed a more evident in the crystallizing reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib will have traditional gender standards to Leibe by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vortices sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly lower-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch out into the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years in Jordan the number of 'volunteered' has increased the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary President in 2016 achieved its peak; however, it is still terrified that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of morale or domestic violence, to be appropriate."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime against the year 1954, women who are imprisoned in the danger of domestic violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee by the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is known for this, not to withdraw from subjects that are long as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib refuted that his work is political, however, is that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became a policy to me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are at the core of the core, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which you can get in his words," what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality by LGBTQ + -individuals were greatly sed until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, to later notice that his comments were turned out of the context and had been censed in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube there was uploaded without cuts, but there was only a edited version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which is still alive today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks for himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality, why can I not leave Jordan?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic news service took several former government officials and members of the teaching network, with the reasoning; they had expressed critically on comments in social media which coincided with the deep within the country which were deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaib's view is according to the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian paper."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"it's progress for him is progress for continuous giving and taking. Jordan has rescated Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is of slow, careful and internal change. it is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordanic society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately dreamed Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not only dreams of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will rejoice with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, stretching and artificial style. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time is, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, the Aman as Student Fellow. "</seg>

<seg id="2182">The article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love-letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel fully equipped with affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely this question went to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth-Foundation and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people to do so, guerrilla warfare."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently was their land swings of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla Movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was considered the subsign of the peace treaty than so important, that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Kolumbians, there is a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who have lived in illegal camps for many years and have been exposed to war-rhetoric and around the clock, they must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla warfare, they must now take up into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians would close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare that are to be given personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day of love letters, but those who forget that they need much unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told, he told this year his love with people who need the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"in this way the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who will now find their place in society and have to build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"to date, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumbiens such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I had never thought, that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN in the Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogota traveled in the camp to impart the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were on how they had done before to validate the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters full of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very turbulent moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "" told the policy-knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a representative of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, describe this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerriilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Camclues" "(a sort of hut in which the guerrilla warfare) saw, I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear, go up, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegransom, a deadly weapon in the thorn."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him nevertheless," "hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answered on a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote something so nice, so I answered on it. suddenly the tears went over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was also the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine." "I had never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society without waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as a war and the FARC already recorded in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years ago we have experienced how the social injustice they had to develop into a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this size order it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never found hearing and no voting right, and to recognize that people who are often seen as monster and even hate people who were turned by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but I comforted that all men - even those who are killed and so much damage we can teach us, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbians was prophesied that after the disarmament peace will reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to protest to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now put on peace, a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call on all defender of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead."</seg>

<seg id="2252">"when she was growing, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them why she moved to Moscow."</seg>

<seg id="2257">"it was a acquaintance from Dagestan, a Transwife, who put into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that we made the photos of my documents through the whole Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I will not give her name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the land, but then something happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without having to register without notice, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you do not think, you are in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you stecklick. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality. however, this is a tobacco topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally kaucastic elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so very much I would like to do it, this pastoral barrier can not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am always saying that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look at the person who remember her past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I received a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has spent one and a half months in the gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan had no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced by blood recovery."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still gay men into this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine said, there would be not very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relatives, or have been dropped by their relatives, in order to make a cadyrows court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should it be brought to them, they will show their bodies on television and claim, they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically undered to radialize."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just had someone to detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has since then nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have it simply taken.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person was even taken care of when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not introduced as bandits, there have been no reports so far. we suppose that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you have not allowed to shave these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003 I was already known all over the world, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it is now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to bring us back to the" "civilian isation", "but finally we returned to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were packed; I had colored lashes, carried the tube, and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Sharia has never stirred me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been spared.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redemption: Kharda ma Kharda. that is called "Spotte not over the unhappiness of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if people are funny about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never denied me to never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadensation held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: for as long as Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"as he was appointed to Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiles and logged in, behold you upon a time with Argwohn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily worsensed."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I didn't get a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, arrivals, I begs them to the hospital and help them to get essays."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself as I rested from the flux.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alves.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no sauté with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabines have, the Russians also have whatever; on the entire planet, there is it - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know many think about drinking identity to men who love men, and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truce."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, in order to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community settled, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to punish their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and in 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I am not using feminism identification, even with the intersectionals"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomids Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They put even well-thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come in various areas of life on a glassed ceiling, and that discrimination is moving across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black transient women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I talk about what kind we are physically, seelically and verbally used, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, however, all agree that women - all women - come together to uplift" their voices and "Kumbaya, my lord" to sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexualised violence a institutionalized form of racial-motivated violence, which we are exposed black women on a two-fold manner."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"in addition, black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres, and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all human beings have neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not connect myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands to consider unrighteous, unrighteous people in their thinking that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of one person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I'm exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminized sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"said Ms 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised being in the historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to connect to groupings, which also absorbate through cultural events, our customs and customs, to advance its egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to put white women the importance of tempting of skin colour and sex. for some of them will continue to silent the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectionale feminism was founded in order to give women different sources for a home and limit themselves from the white feminism, still lies the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself full and completely from feminism, which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman, which is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now, it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres, which we are created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author in the book of Africana womens: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can blossoming in an environment in which my life is neither passed, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# soft bottle) that reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police Commissar said Ada Báez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, its Expartner who had become violent against violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time passed and the police spoke, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena pointed out, also the akeable display of Ada Báez is nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved their display."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the devil-circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women only refund an ad in general, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they misses. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 strokes and statistics of the 2 Uninvisible Missions and a legal system, which is nothing subordinated 3 Paraguay's laws: good approach, deficient implementation of beats and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really misses," says Myrian González, research for geniuses at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports that show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However the figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the district of the District Office 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads were given by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts. here 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women spoke that they were physically distracted, 55% of women spoke of psychic failures."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's ministered in Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually displayed." "on every woman who refunded in Paraguay because of psychic mistress display, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman who refunded due to physical exercise, come two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own crime, the law enforcement authorities cannot be appropriately documented how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016 journalists had at least 12 cases of womansuicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman because of violence through men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning they did not want it, but then, to. this should be repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer combined with Carlos. but two years she carried the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognisable the most severe recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"if I read earlier about it, I always thought that that only women happens to be fooled, because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the failure of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people replied to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever had raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of iniquity have at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos that originates from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner will mislead them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychical abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"your prosperous partner finally managed to convince them, they were worthless."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this entry by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the site Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredt, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in Space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"nearly 20 years Morton's work was done only by his own accident and the question, how many salads can get, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them to breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents have not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green-tone or dinning leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and Expert for food security around the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate representatives of a millennia tradition, Morton was still salad, he now needs to be more and more difficult for this work."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock-brocks to whom I must pumped."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed any new saline sorties because all features are patented, so good as possible and tried to raise the characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use any material which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also attached a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Centre ISS have bred red tube salat in the "greenhouses" of the station and eaten. there it is tested whether plants cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that, when the movement originates from the IT-sector, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" open source "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was summoned to ensure that some plant species and salaries are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, in short Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can use the seeds of seeds freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." "open source" "breeders only permit others to breed their seed, to cross its own varieties, and it is not immediately visible - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant-processing."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seeds also plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to utilize the latter or just a little by raising seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasizes, that the" open-source "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants may be patented, whether vegetables, grain, GM, or not, from ecological agriculture or not." who want to purchase our objective of ecological sustainability, "" he says and participates in the increasingly more frequently-increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way it is bred based on how this vegetables are bred. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutritionality without seed-sensitivity is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing others their seed, and thus their approach will be patched in contrast, seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available recovery pool due to becoming increasingly numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is thus always restricted, unencumhrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has been employed in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation at carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartels are protected as intellectual property, thus making it available for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suspected that mass-built plants like wheat are patented in a larger scale as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - of such, through which their taste or colour increases until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeder caused by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-speaker at Carly Scaduto believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining the genetical diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts the opinion that Intellectual Property store other breeder, since" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can abide as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibits innovations not, but promotes them by the public provided more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, but certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait for a long time to grow, to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the battle would have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main argument for Morton, however, that genetic resources always have been a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton refers to the concept to patenting the material characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants are up to them themselves, and as breeders, we finally have no idea of how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of crop breeding:" "who bred a variety, also bred its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monokultures believed to grow in their varieties of farming this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very rainy. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such who are moving to international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders "Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that breeder caused by the Avoid of plant patients" innovative ":" it looks like I am producing my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago," "he says." "with a patent, one is 20 years ago protected against competition, which makes it very nice simply."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept now spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, an" open source "seed program. the center with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties to meet specific requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come in "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agreement, an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding different from country to country, absent from the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventional plants allowed."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation still is not a law; now it is possible to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed companies and seed companies from all East Africa in order to learn something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems" that the organization currently building a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, for the planned next year of the official startup. "</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonreturn development organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the future of food - a combination of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published. in this, it represents that farmers may have the opportunity to co-operate and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby von Ossi that will soon see him more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we now try to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods. "</seg>

<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government conducted the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world."</seg>

ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these goals. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these goals and not admit it. we insist on to fulfill our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first ensored website of a human rights organization in Egypt since the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web pages, as e.g. the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-language issue of Huffington Post, and that from Qatar's network of al Jazeera because of" "support of terrorism".

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, while he reported on the student proteste and a video recorded, as the police had physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article focuses primarily on politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the, blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blockage of the blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to imitate me the feeling of a siege of siege; a arrest, a attempted murder, pre-loading with national Security Council, the blockers of blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I have not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small public."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post items to handle the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>

<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and filtering on the Egyptian users.</seg>

<seg id="2887">Several days after his run Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coherence. the work was heavy and made it sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his minor wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a strange country along with other refugees and towed saws with mortar that were heavier than he himself to make himself his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of afghing refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," reminded Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (afghan refugees) lived in a leerstanding building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there was no services there and no heating. we pylon nylon in front of the open windows, so that we will not freshen up at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf survived his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous override on the sea, he suffered ship and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, went alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal to the needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for distrust asylum seekers, but it is true also that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>

<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000" special entrance centres. "this is improvised, in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be shared with an entrance center if they officially added a request for asylum - which can move after the registration of asylum seekers or monthly."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for an accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it is also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncrowful life-angle helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years in the construction industry, Asharaf grew its entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
