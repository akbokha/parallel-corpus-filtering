this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he spectacular published that the N@@ SA was illeg@@ ally owned by Americans from Americans . &quot;
but it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA is literally dra@@ ined to the Iran dra@@ fts for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know that the chapters did not come out ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has established against R@@ isen , and encouraged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish the secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ gs that they can give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ porter had already done before him : he refused , and said he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was thus living with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years of indications that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and sources can be less hidden .
&quot; instead of moving and re@@ port@@ ations to the statements , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators have become concerned without his consent , his telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ king . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work than secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers of a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional measures , because the government has more and more possibilities to pi@@ erce all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can contact the moment in which they contact , instead of entering into a witness . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen , his book written , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet famous , which was developed by us against Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload or send information , as in any common contact form . &quot;
this will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has the respective message agency access .
&quot; so the government can no longer complain about secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would be requested would not be available from the outset . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ag@@ it@@ echn@@ ologies all over the world . &quot;
&quot; it is to be sure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to feed ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ norm@@ alities in the provision of soldiers are modest and full of crowded hospitals will report . or the next environmental workers , the alarm suggests the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest datas@@ he@@ et of the story published &#91; ... &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the kingdoms and ma@@ ids are hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; This week we were signed by news about a rectangle of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sec@@ a law in Panama . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to firms like Mos@@ sy Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an integral of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s tri@@ bun@@ als in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin performs a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next unveil@@ ed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of a agency or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems weeping from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go about what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty men are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay off their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ ing , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and reveal something . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will see this whole world very confusing , and it is hard to understand how this tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ b .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably because there were no prominent Americans so far , that occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no enough Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data cut@@ ler@@ y from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to create a company as to get a libr@@ arian group . &quot;
&quot; this type of transparency in the US has allowed the employees of school @-@ wing , school children . &quot;
&quot; it has allowed frau@@ ds , particularly vulnerable investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global W@@ ing we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; let us really sho@@ cked up , that all the right to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator made suggestions on how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ fixes . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course there was no money handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions forward to our co@@ vert investigation .
it is not about one of the leaders of the leaders in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound everything very much , as if we could do anything against it ; as if nothing else has changed ; as if it is always the rich and mighty one will give . &quot;
&quot; but as well @-@ born optim@@ ist , I see that some changes has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen anticip@@ ates towards more transparency , which affects the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 , in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has captured the central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ aries , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and global . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ing this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind lights .
&quot; we need managers in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the issue and use it , through laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; that is the story , as I was almost un@@ kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ et . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a h@@ ho@@ on sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained stand and looked upon my things .
he bought one of my artwork .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip throughout the country . after that he would go to the peace @-@ scor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you kill them tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I do not know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him just now ! he says he would go to the peace Cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ ar ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; I have a bubble . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh dear ! what did I have built up with me ? &quot;
a wild side@@ walk in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I was given such a fear that I got out of the bed , on ti@@ pps to the door , and my sleeping room door shut down . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me now depends on his classroom . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends who only waited for being discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accomo@@ date people on my air mattresses , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattresses . &quot;
&quot; we make a break , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can do it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived , how we could make some about it . our apartment is going to be a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded as &quot; &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air floor on wood floors .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we left our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , star@@ red Brian and I joined us . &quot;
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rent ?
things came in roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their doors , the type of room whose doors are closed if you visit . &quot;
over the internet you can invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would start .
&quot; but , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still under comfort , would invest in a shop , the stran@@ ger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have learned as children that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get on the things you can do well . we could des@@ ig@@ ars . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to susp@@ ect objects , but now we wanted to create thanks by the immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design be something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a tasting at what degree confidence we gr@@ asp@@ ed .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock mobile phone to your left seat .
this quietly escape from panic that you can now feel -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door .
&quot; because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the bul@@ ky phone of a foreig@@ ner in his hands ?
the majority sense the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel when they spend somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once so who has actually Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you proc@@ laim on Twitter that he is responsible for the office of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you have seen what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have introduced only once with his name ; if he would have told , where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ divisions , which all say : &quot; he can really stick very well @-@ out cell@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strengthens the trust critical .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative assess@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assess@@ ments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have carried out a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ disposition .
exciting is going to add the call of a person -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , but changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is common to similarities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we learned that confidence depends on how much you can do . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , as for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; , one gets rather not a reply . &quot;
&quot; if you tell a lot , how for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to establish this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against foreigners . &quot;
&quot; what we did not reck@@ oned , was the great multitude of people who were more than ready to lay these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people do our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , : incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business is currently very good .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who allowed un@@ allowed parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it does hurt if I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million paid nights had only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
because people trust one another rightly .
&quot; if trust works , it can be wonderful . &quot;
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him in the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , which tend to tend to heart with other activities of heart attack . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true prot@@ esters that save lives , though they do not know properly . &quot;
&quot; they drive a car in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is of course not running every stay .
but these relationships behind the pure money reaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled on this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about economic trade .
&quot; but now it is just called &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the matter will not do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of itself open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would be , if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what would be if at any place you have visited , a group there Ans@@ äs@@ si@@ ger would wait to fill a thoroughly and a pub that has never heard of , of which you have never heard . &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to the participants ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of common ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to society and relations , instead of lon@@ eliness and appreciation . &quot;
&quot; South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parks that were owned by the government . &quot;
&quot; residents are now offered . students , who were searching for a messenger , &quot;
were convey@@ ed in people whose children were pulled out . it became incub@@ ator programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was attached to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there was also previously .
there were already similar websites .
so why has just our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we know that one can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amazing , &quot;
straight over@@ powering .
I just have to think about when a red Maz@@ da drives over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself how we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think of when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , a brain @-@ la@@ undering , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you the fault of your negative impressions .
so the media people represent that look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslims , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
I am both intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ cht@@ ern @-@ Fitness fan@@ atics in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided on this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friendship were horri@@ fied : &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Fun@@ ny was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have dealt with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought he thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to crying .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever felt that someone else takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian Dream &quot; dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had to come out at the end , watched on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should one do something ?
&quot; I moved the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam , ... &quot; &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Zer@@ bom@@ bs Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the n@@ u turned the deeds of others from a citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and begin with the building program . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Muslim organizations that said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; bl@@ em@@ es in well lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ers not you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims , to cr@@ ush it and struck . &quot;
there were really bran@@ dan@@ ies on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country had attacked our country .
I threw the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly be able to explain themselves .
&quot; I have nothing to answer questions , I love questions . &quot;
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims p@@ ans and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community as of a tum@@ our in the United States body .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good @-@ good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor stops just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers - creators and Olympi@@ as .
will the closing of mus@@ c America safer ?
&quot; it may stop a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque is leading to consider people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation . &quot;
&quot; and as the head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told , people will actually not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ ated in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; during the radic@@ alization process , one has noticed that it will start online . as a trial , the person can make a brain @-@ la@@ undering , that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ises their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; when we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claim@@ ing to be Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS constitutes their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , when one recognizes them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one throws a look at it , it doesn &apos;t drive on what they are las@@ hed in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with a radical religious leader .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , their sense of injustice in the world , they would only bring into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense of her anger , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that gave her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m was again the link to God and her church .
&quot; instead of blame them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , they keep it to connect to the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerned .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affects our democracy every day on our thinking freedom ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian governmental system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you have reported test messages , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they agreed rather than military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an acute problem .
&quot; when you look when the mood against Muslims goes up on the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early war@@ nings .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear ends us all . &quot;
in the assignment of collective blame it is not only about to explain themselves .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , very promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person , whom they knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is such a versi@@ dad become such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , having statements against Muslims on his facebook page . &quot;
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
thus back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we remained safe at home ?
&quot; we found it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we would leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely un@@ filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked himself and was welcomed to our guests , because half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers , believers , and non @-@ believers , who had come to attack , but to join us . &quot;
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to be sure of number ?
or become familiar to those that mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ talk , a thin@@ ker with deep @-@ walk , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ án : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am totally normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not uncommon .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , in no way I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , stands just before it , an billions @-@ business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dron@@ es . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ package creation into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built an six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; due to inter@@ connecting passenger vessels , high speed and speed up to a narrow room . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ date structures .
they have learned to wear loads with turbul@@ ence and to react generally to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a offsprings of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest point . such as &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a plane , which tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p . &quot;
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient in the reverse flight , much more efficient than a helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of the starters , it can float up , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ ul@@ star@@ es is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device will be able to regain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions related to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago trained pilot @-@ controlled air@@ devices could fly , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a p@@ eck@@ ru@@ des . &quot;
&quot; recently discovered , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ ic , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote machine . it was recently invented . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hinges and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ator or controversy , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple that happens inside the interior very much , so that it can fly stable and move across the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the h@@ ore . to bring it to fly , I must really throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood to have it exactly right when all to watch me is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the Mon@@ osp@@ ic is an exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the om@@ is@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ings , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is not only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the proper ability , &quot;
move in the space in all directions regardless of which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers by the eight prop@@ ell@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; some of them is conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly from the fly . &quot;
let &apos;s see what we see .
&quot; if air machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this turns into the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studied synthetic scar@@ ce .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with localization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us is the reward in the development and the creation of creation .
&quot; it serves as memory , as wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , to shape them in the spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake is on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; about 1,@@ 3 billion years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes are becoming increasingly faster , they turned into so the mass of thirteen explor@@ ers in a tenth of a pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they brigh@@ ter brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us well known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but your energy does not put them freely in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time Ge@@ ur itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events in a timely manner . &quot;
about 3 billion years ago there was a multi@@ polar life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sauce , people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped them crazy .
&quot; but enough people know them as crazy gen@@ ies , so the U.S. National Science Foundation supported their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally observ@@ atory observ@@ atory . &quot;
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase the recognition performance enormously improved .
therefore it is called an Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissioning of the det@@ ector , ro@@ uted the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of both col@@ li@@ zing black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my to@@ d@@ ill father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that for which I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on M@@ IT . he has been examined for 23 years gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and their by observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a c@@ abl@@ ishment in the texture of space and time .
&quot; when shooting the wave , the space and its overall content is stretched into one direction , and into the other . &quot;
to illustrate lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often a really al@@ ber@@ cul@@ ated dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out by us during the waves of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ oes after the comm@@ a , followed by an 1 . W@@ here@@ fore they explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear war . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ O , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are awakened , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LIG@@ O . Scott has liked , LIG@@ O is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a w@@ avel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial coatings , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of coming light around you .
in tones the other is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a w@@ avel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which you mean particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like clay and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , she speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks her . &quot;
&quot; fragran@@ t Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the space .
&quot; but by looking at changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies are available in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into wood , we can literally speak the all @-@ literally . &quot;
&quot; the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has been employed for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two bodies very quickly and you hear the same p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es with an additional key change . this sounds like the Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu !
&quot; it is a kind of movement , character@@ izes in the w@@ av@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I must never forget -- the LIG@@ O Fol@@ der : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the sticks of your bl@@ ender . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns which other with a mass of 36 m@@ ns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the constant importance of LIG@@ O .
&quot; LIG@@ O eb@@ net a completely new way to research of the universe , as it was never before possible . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the space and the invisible ones .
much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen however at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the urine is covered by its own glow . &quot;
&quot; using Gravit@@ on@@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never be seen and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O was immediately found in the first attempt of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O @-@ project , says to this subject : me : the type of stars , the black holes prot@@ ector , such as LIG@@ O are observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . black holes are so to say the sauce for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we left out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine all yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
would I like to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the swing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I desp@@ ised my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life deeply changed , on an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; kittens &quot; , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress in the south .
&quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
she asked her once I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude in my family . from there I sw@@ am going to play with them as soon as you call me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : only recently I was fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sa@@ ws to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think of things , awake you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate television . I producing television .
&quot; I do TV , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; every shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days and four shows , so all nine days 20 Million Dollar TV , four broad@@ casting , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series work on Thursday night .
&quot; throughout the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created , and not only produced , so still ob@@ tru@@ sive . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans at camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that can burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who this still makes ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a land or a household , take me seriously if I am talking about work , so you understand that I don &apos;t only say on the computer ro@@ b and f@@ anta@@ si@@ ere , and it is true when I say , I understand that there is not dre@@ aming in a dream@@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all silence -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , as I turned on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; to wear a high tone , fly a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work runs well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a animated road , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people will take when I cl@@ oned them the bu@@ zz , that I was talking about writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I began with television production , when I began working and work and to work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this energy , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the sums is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive differently from your size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling not to be differently compared to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called Gen@@ ie .
maybe it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz .
&quot; I will just say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more shipments , the more over@@ flowing borders , the more work there , the more watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , do not come true ? &quot;
&quot; the land which I create , the marathon that I lead , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , expanded , expanded . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work institute . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my ni@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz heard . &quot;
the sums of the engine collap@@ sed .
I don &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours days , completed weekends , no re@@ del@@ ity , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showing @-@ Titan .
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; hypo@@ l thee out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you want to be , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker , a mother , and knows how to feel the bu@@ zz , if the sums stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; listening to the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late ! and she says , &quot; Mama , &quot; you play ? &quot;
and I will say no longer than two things to be aware of :
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she called me not &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it calls no more &quot; &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I forgot it when I am Titan am and my bu@@ zz , and here everything is changing from my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , &quot; do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of Sum@@ mens , I can do nothing but to quit . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land which I create , the marathon that I lead , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ ist sti@@ p@@ ens and the song in which it leaves slo@@ gans , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no total volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the fix@@ ture , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I say to you who I am when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not force and it is not unemployed .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , which resulted in performing tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan Poker ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this to the firm rule so that I can free myself as work@@ a@@ holic from any fault .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz back . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play not to me , just how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am always working because I love it .
I am rather at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we are back in the garden , before and back , round and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ ashed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I still g@@ ri@@ pe according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe filled me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I wonder : why have we ever stopped with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a day dream@@ y .
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can be found less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at no more than 15 minutes , until they stum@@ bles that they want to do something else . &quot;
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ le or K@@ ek replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen @-@ daughter throughout 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
everyone can attach 15 minutes to a piece by yourself on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my bene@@ factors , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ;
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I hur@@ ry and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I &apos;ve given up , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes a piece on why not full 15 minutes treat yourself ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I do not work .
work doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear a well @-@ known melody , she meets me and my soul . I listen to new ideas . I use it into full power and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... not anymore . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my bu@@ zz .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me sn@@ ap that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my stock is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier , I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more cle@@ arer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land which I create , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , advertis@@ ed , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me broad . less titanium -- more ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think of things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
that is the dream of this job .
because a dream job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
ti@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical in .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a consistent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was using functional Neuro@@ surgical surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; lowering stag &quot; . in doing so , one impl@@ anted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuit circles of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered under fierce tre@@ m@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a leading torso and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I experienced patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
&quot; you have to imagine that in case of skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain is tigh@@ tly incl@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the skull @-@ minded . &quot;
&quot; to do this , one sometimes has to remove a part of a ben@@ evol@@ ent brain mass . &quot;
&quot; rather than throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue , is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many mer@@ ges it Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ an lessons that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , tiny niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in surgery .
we took another fascinating observation : normal master cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells kept differently .
they were slow and after a few weeks she died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of bra@@ ins from the non @-@ speaking range and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
&quot; and then , then highlight it in the brain , to be able to pursue them in the brain . &quot;
in the last step re@@ impl@@ anted it to the Ent@@ rance est@@ ay of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist tran@@ spl@@ ant -- car tran@@ spl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we impl@@ ant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we impl@@ anted the same cells in curved brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with ape .
&quot; in the first scenario re@@ impl@@ anted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we made an injury to and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells kept -- they didn &apos;t get to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were impl@@ anted .
&quot; the proof that they show , these small points are . these are the cells that we found in vit@@ ro in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
so we tra@@ vers@@ ed ape with a manual de@@ bug task .
you had to take feeding from a tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we realized in the motor Cor@@ tex the manual technology . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen at people , they recovered spontane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural bra@@ in@@ mechanisms . you can relax to some degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkeys that recovered spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % up to 50 % of its original power before injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stim@@ ulus . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use later on .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need that . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to look at the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will it permit us to start the authority soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ centric study .
you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you so much .
democracy .
&quot; in the west , we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ge@@ aring .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ mer in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and an impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes which were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my dear friends that would be repeated if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I please , together with me to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ enses democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are gem@@ stone , our future dark , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins summit &quot; Parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
yet only few are recognizing the Twin @-@ Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the li@@ fel@@ low@@ ships and corporations , which could lead to anxi@@ ous , where it would be productive and in@@ comes , with which you need to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and the euro area have invested 3,4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , tracks , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars sounds a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars that have been around for the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else , except the flan@@ ging and to prescri@@ be the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; so debt and un@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins summit , which are not the same as the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the results are stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest in which they do not invest . just as o@@ edi@@ pus father , of fear , the prophecy of the O@@ ra@@ k@@ el might be true that his son would kill him when he will grow . &quot;
&quot; un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances leads to that , that oils are killing him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ w@@ ling with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly wast@@ ew@@ ic Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form in which the free and poor people control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error to make the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these conclusions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it was the working poor , not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and crucial that they have the right to political co @-@ determination in questions of state aid . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy did not have a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which lit very bright , it is also fast hidden . &quot;
&quot; however , our modern liberal democr@@ acies did not present their roots in ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Magna C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Charta , which ultimately was a statute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has been bordered to politics , while the economy - thus , the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was established . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies since the time , this separation from politics and economy began to immig@@ rated a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy slowly mig@@ rated and depri@@ ved them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not part of a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it cannot be in the government today , and yet it is not in power , because the power of politics is emig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ irs with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about such as a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es which has thus sustain@@ ably the animals , of which it nourished , dec@@ eas@@ ed that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far can@@ ni@@ ed by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows worse , inequality increases , the overall economic demand falling and the management of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism ow@@ es the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserve control so as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea for 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t bad .
the teaching of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ occupied by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating autom@@ ate the tw@@ ins increase , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it is - very soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and we consider that we end the re@@ united field of democracy , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that let the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interest@@ ingly question is whether capitalism is lo@@ osed through a di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve man and people put their energy into the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what did it mean , how could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar h@@ yst@@ one ? &quot;
&quot; in the practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples soon . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : put yourself a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income deri@@ ves from capital and dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction more between those who work the companies who do not work therein , and employees who work there are not . no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no empor@@ aries between investment and austerity . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies should have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 major Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the whole world trade in this currency will be tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds in &quot; green &quot; technologies inv@@ ests , especially in parts of the world , in which investment means are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ alization , in which they preferred to be privileged people , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the sle@@ eves of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ onic , globally key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ ec@@ top@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we are working together politically .
it is in our hands and we are doing it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you set yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in general economic demand , which lar@@ ry as &quot; long term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ alism is low . &quot;
&quot; when this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely wir@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ t , one thinks not enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the note of a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to policy , while the area where most of the economy , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically . &quot;
Liber@@ alism - Liber@@ al as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially skep@@ tical as regards the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now watch in China , resembles most of the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now China now throw what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure many list@@ ener are curious about your experiences as the minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I im@@ it@@ ated that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive displ@@ ac@@ ement line passed through the eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the by the way , the first proposal that denial was revealed -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to have chosen the denial . &quot;
&quot; but you know yes , what comes . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to obtain a economic system that is not excessive , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism alive , you might be able to delay it perhaps a while , but if then the change happens , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ o ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he did not make mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the parties of the don@@ or , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government merely because they did not want to deal with the obj@@ ections caused by the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to conc@@ ede that she has had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nom@@ inate GDP .
that &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Troika of the funds imposed by us this policy has imposed us : &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive piece of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the acqu@@ itted Fli@@ eh@@ forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astrous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we hit ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , for which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
thank you so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 @-@ term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is leading attach@@ ter at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; it is 47 years old , slim , has a refres@@ hed and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because it is responsible to choose the shows and the content to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the review is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; will your show be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ one , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , the addic@@ tive where , after you saw a rel@@ el , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to for@@ bid &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thought about the average explo@@ iting , average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they are simply not enth@@ used . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right hand .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something special , that &apos;s why Roy price does not want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he requires a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can look at any free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives things out there , you can take a look , correct ? &quot;
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything .
&quot; you can capture , when you start the show when you pause , which parts you get ski@@ ps or once more . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with this data which show them to produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four re@@ publi@@ can U.S. transm@@ itters . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; Alpha House , &quot; but Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ ted at 7.5 -- i.e. something on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they show the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience , which shows they like , which producers , which actors have . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a vehicle and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has got a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed . &quot;
they connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic happens somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years to statistics than back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work so this is something terri@@ fying , because we live in a time when we live more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software .
&quot; if anyone is in the US in prison and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , will decide whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data rever@@ sible companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 Google announced that they can predic@@ t through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worse way , they can predic@@ ate -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success sh@@ aded in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year round year round year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data rever@@ ting companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all of these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people use un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions , like the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first step , you put this problem into its parts , so you can analyse the components ; as a broad , you put the parts again together to get a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help solve a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something that &apos;s good in which the brain is good , it is pieces and pieces come up again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to put a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to better understand their audience , what else you would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all of these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first than they we@@ ather@@ ed around TV @-@ ideas , then they elected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is pretty useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; - just here at this moment . &quot;
I will later bla@@ ze it later with a technology .
&quot; I have so far made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more actu@@ alizing , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; so perhaps the ball cl@@ ums@@ y and cl@@ ums@@ y and cl@@ ums@@ y . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news , that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
