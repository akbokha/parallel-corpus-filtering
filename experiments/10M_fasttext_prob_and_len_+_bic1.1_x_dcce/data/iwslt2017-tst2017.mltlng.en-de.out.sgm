<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he spectacular published that the NSA was illegally owned by Americans from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation, in which the CIA is literally drained to the Iran drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know that the chapters did not come out?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has established against Risen, and encouraged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish the secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mugs that they can give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government at Risen, he did something that many brave reporter had already done before him: he refused, and said he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was thus living with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years of indications that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can be less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of moving and reportations to the statements, they could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators have become concerned without his consent, his telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and risking."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work than secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers of a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional measures, because the government has more and more possibilities to pierce all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can contact the moment in which they contact, instead of entering into a witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been written as Risen, his book written, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet famous, which was developed by us against Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload or send information, as in any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has the respective message agency access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer complain about secretly, and many of the information they would be requested would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spagitechnologies all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to be sure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have a way to feed iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the abnormalities in the provision of soldiers are modest and full of crowded hospitals will report. or the next environmental workers, the alarm suggests the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest datasheet of the story published [...] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that the kingdoms and maids are hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] This week we were signed by news about a rectangle of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosseca law in Panama.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to firms like Mossy Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an integral of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's tribunals in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin performs a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of a agency or John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go about what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty men are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay off their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Wing, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and reveal something."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will see this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapub.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far, that occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no enough Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data cutlery from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to create a company as to get a librarian group."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this type of transparency in the US has allowed the employees of school-wing, school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has allowed frauds, particularly vulnerable investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Wing we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"let us really shocked up, that all the right to a lawyer of our investigator made suggestions on how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prefixes. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course there was no money handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions forward to our covert investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about one of the leaders of the leaders in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound everything very much, as if we could do anything against it; as if nothing else has changed; as if it is always the rich and mighty one will give."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as well-born optimist, I see that some changes has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen anticipates towards more transparency, which affects the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013, in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has captured the central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentaries, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Wing this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind lights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need managers in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparence is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the issue and use it, through laws to end this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"that is the story, as I was almost unkidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazet."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a hhoon sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained stand and looked upon my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip throughout the country. after that he would go to the peace-scorps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you kill them tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I do not know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him just now! he says he would go to the peace Corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazar!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me saying," "I have a bubble. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought:" "Oh dear! what did I have built up with me?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sidewalk in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I was given such a fear that I got out of the bed, on tipps to the door, and my sleeping room door shut down."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me now depends on his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who only waited for being discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accomodate people on my air mattresses, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a break, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can do it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I survived, how we could make some about it. our apartment is going to be a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded as "" air mattresses and breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air floor on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we left our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, starred Brian and I joined us."</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to investors:" "we want to create a website where people post public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their doors, the type of room whose doors are closed if you visit."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet you can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would start.</seg>
<seg id="142">"but, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still under comfort, would invest in a shop, the stranger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get on the things you can do well. we could desigars."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to suspect objects, but now we wanted to create thanks by the immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tasting at what degree confidence we grasped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlock mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly escape from panic that you can now feel -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the bulky phone of a foreigner in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also the most guests feel when they spend somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so who has actually Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he is responsible for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have seen what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have introduced only once with his name; if he would have told, where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 Beurdivisions, which all say:" he can really stick very well-out cellphones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the trust critical.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have carried out a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is going to add the call of a person -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three ratings, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, but changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common to similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that confidence depends on how much you can do."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you say too little, as for example" Hi! ", one gets rather not a reply."</seg>
<seg id="189">"if you tell a lot, how for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to establish this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not reckoned, was the great multitude of people who were more than ready to lay these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people do our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first,: incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is currently very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who allowed unallowed parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it does hurt if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million paid nights had only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust one another rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can be wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tend to tend to heart with other activities of heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are true protesters that save lives, though they do not know properly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive a car in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is of course not running every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money reaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled on this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is just called" "rental industry", "the matter will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place you have visited, a group there Ansässiger would wait to fill a thoroughly and a pub that has never heard of, of which you have never heard."</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to the participants?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of common?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us to society and relations, instead of loneliness and appreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parks that were owned by the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"residents are now offered. students, who were searching for a messenger,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed in people whose children were pulled out. it became incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we know that one can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight overpowering.</seg>
<seg id="252">I just have to think about when a red Mazda drives over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself how we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think of when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, a brain-laundering, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you the fault of your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslims, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am both introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtern-Fitness fanatics in</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muscle."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided on this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry the hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friendship were horrified: "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Funny was: at that time it was a feminist independence of independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have dealt with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought he thought in question, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever felt that someone else takes you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian Dream "dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had to come out at the end, watched on the screen and saw the word" Eilabouts. "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spranged from buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "in the name of Islam,..." "... jihad..."... "... Zerbombs Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the nu turned the deeds of others from a citizen into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and begin with the building program."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Muslim organizations that said:" be watchful, "" be vigilant, "" blemes in well lighted areas, "" Versammmers not you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims, to crush it and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandanies on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I threw the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly be able to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to answer questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims pans and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community as of a tumour in the United States body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or good-good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor stops just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers - creators and Olympias.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of musc America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may stop a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque is leading to consider people of other faiths, and to show greater citizens' participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as the head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told, people will actually not be radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radiated in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"during the radicalization process, one has noticed that it will start online. as a trial, the person can make a brain-laundering, that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despises their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"when we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming to be Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS constitutes their brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, when one recognizes them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it doesn't drive on what they are lashed in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with a radical religious leader.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, their sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense of her anger, she was a main objective for the instrumentalization by extremists that gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam was again the link to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of blame them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they keep it to connect to the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affects our democracy every day on our thinking freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian governmental system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you have reported test messages, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they agreed rather than military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an acute problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look when the mood against Muslims goes up on the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warnings.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear ends us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective blame it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, very promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous person, whom they knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a versidad become such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, having statements against Muslims on his facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">Thus back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we remained safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we found it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we would leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we went silent, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely unfilled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked himself and was welcomed to our guests, because half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers, believers, and non-believers, who had come to attack, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be sure of number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become familiar to those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for crafting, stands just before it, an billions-business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-package creation into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built an six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"due to interconnecting passenger vessels, high speed and speed up to a narrow room."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-date structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads with turbulence and to react generally to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order that a system works autonomously, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest point. such as" "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane, which tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the reverse flight, much more efficient than a helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most of the starters, it can float up, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hulstares is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device will be able to regain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions related to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago trained pilot-controlled airdevices could fly, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a peckrudes."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently discovered, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospic, the mechanically easiest remote machine. it was recently invented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuator or controversy, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple that happens inside the interior very much, so that it can fly stable and move across the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hore. to bring it to fly, I must really throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to have it exactly right when all to watch me is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the Monospic is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the omiscopter with its eight propellings, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the space in all directions regardless of which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers by the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some of them is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly from the fly."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see what we see.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if air machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic scarce.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine there would like to be a flying lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us is the reward in the development and the creation of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, as wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, to shape them in the spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake is on the cake."</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"about 1,3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are becoming increasingly faster, they turned into so the mass of thirteen explorers in a tenth of a pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they brighter brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us well known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But your energy does not put them freely in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time Geur itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first, we arrange the events in a timely manner."</seg>
<seg id="476">About 3 billion years ago there was a multipolar life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauce, people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by collidizing black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people know them as crazy genies, so the U.S. National Science Foundation supported their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-Interferometrically observatory observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO could considerably increase the recognition performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called an Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after commissioning of the detector, routed the gravitational-waves of both collizing black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that for which I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been examined for 23 years gravitational-waves of black holes and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a cablishment in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when shooting the wave, the space and its overall content is stretched into one direction, and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for relativity theory often a really alberculated dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out by us during the waves of the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeroes after the comma, followed by an 1. Wherefore they explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear war. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGO, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are awakened, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott has liked, LIGO is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial coatings, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones the other is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which you mean particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, she speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"fragrant Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by looking at changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are available in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into wood, we can literally speak the all-literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has been employed for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, pantelopes simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly and you hear the same pantelopes with an additional key change. this sounds like the Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, characterizes in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I must never forget -- the LIGO Folder:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as fast as the sticks of your blender."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns which other with a mass of 36 mns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the constant importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO ebnet a completely new way to research of the universe, as it was never before possible."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and the invisible ones.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen however at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the urine is covered by its own glow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using Gravitonwaves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never be seen and of which we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO was immediately found in the first attempt of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO-project, says to this subject: me: the type of stars, the black holes protector, such as LIGO are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. black holes are so to say the sauce for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we left out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine all yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year I would say to all" "yes!" "in front of which I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I like to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I despised my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, that my life deeply changed, on an unexpected way. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" "kittens", "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress in the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her once I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude in my family. from there I swam going to play with them as soon as you call me. no matter what I do, or where I go, I say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very happy."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side-effect: only recently I was fully understood that the "Yes" saws to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think of things, awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create television. I producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"every shipment offers hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days and four shows, so all nine days 20 Million Dollar TV, four broadcasting, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series work on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">"throughout the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million spectators."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts, which I have created, and not only produced, so still obtrusive. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans at campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that can burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a land or a household, take me seriously if I am talking about work, so you understand that I don't only say on the computer rob and fantasiere, and it is true when I say, I understand that there is not dreaming in a dreamjob."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all silence -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, as I turned on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"to wear a high tone, fly a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a animated road, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people will take when I cloned them the buzz, that I was talking about writing, that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began with television production, when I began working and work and to work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this energy, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive differently from your size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling not to be differently compared to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure and I just know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will just say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more shipments, the more overflowing borders, the more work there, the more watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, do not come true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land which I create, the marathon that I lead, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, expanded, expanded."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work institute."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nianny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same title work, 15 hours days, completed weekends, no redelity, nothing to delegate, a titanium, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showing-Titan.</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "hypol thee out, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you want to be, you love what you do to be a teacher, a banker, a banker, a banker, a mother, and knows how to feel the buzz, if the sums stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"listening to the song of my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress" poses me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to outside, late! and she says," Mama, "you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no longer than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she called me not" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"it calls no more" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I forgot it when I am Titan am and my buzz, and here everything is changing from my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, "do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of Summens, I can do nothing but to quit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land which I create, the marathon that I lead, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, waist stipens and the song in which it leaves slogans, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no total volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the fixture, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I say to you who I am when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not force and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of the story, which resulted in performing tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to God the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan Poker?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, a lot more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this to the firm rule so that I can free myself as workaholic from any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz back."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play not to me, just how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we are back in the garden, before and back, round and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I still gripe according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe filled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I wonder: why have we ever stopped with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve for a day dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be found less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at no more than 15 minutes, until they stumbles that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkle or Kek replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teen-daughter throughout 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can attach 15 minutes to a piece by yourself on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are finished."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my benefactors, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy;</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I hurry and I siege. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is just for everything I've given up, when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece on why not full 15 minutes treat yourself?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear a well-known melody, she meets me and my soul. I listen to new ideas. I use it into full power and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... not anymore."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of work is part of me, but just a part. and therefore I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me snap that I am a titanium. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my stock is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier, I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land which I create, the marathon, the canvases, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, advertised, naked and new life-feeling in me broad. less titanium -- more!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think of things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job.</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Tians have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical in.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a consistent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was using functional Neurosurgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" lowering stag ". in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuit circles of neurons so that the neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a leading torso and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I experienced patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that in case of skull-Hirn-traumas, the brain is tightly inclined."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull-minded."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, one sometimes has to remove a part of a benevolent brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"rather than throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue, is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many merges it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologian lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, tiny niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We took another fascinating observation: normal master cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells kept differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks she died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brains from the non-speaking range and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">"and then, then highlight it in the brain, to be able to pursue them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step reimplanted it to the Entrance estay of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- car transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in curved brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with ape.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells kept -- they didn't get to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show, these small points are. these are the cells that we found in vitro in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we traversed ape with a manual debug task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feeding from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we realized in the motor Cortex the manual technology."</seg>
<seg id="869">"subsequently, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen at people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brainmechanisms. you can relax to some degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% up to 50% of its original power before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulus."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later on.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to look at the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it permit us to start the authority soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it. "</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the west, we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitmer in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and an impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes which were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my dear friends that would be repeated if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I please, together with me to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenses democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are gemstone, our future dark, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins summit" Paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet only few are recognizing the Twin-Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the lifellowships and corporations, which could lead to anxious, where it would be productive and incomes, with which you need to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and the euro area have invested 3,4 trillion US dollars, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, tracks, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars that have been around for the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else, except the flanging and to prescribe the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"so debt and unproductive capital form the twins summit, which are not the same as the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the results are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest in which they do not invest. just as oedipus father, of fear, the prophecy of the Orakel might be true that his son would kill him when he will grow."</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances leads to that, that oils are killing him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hawling with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly wastewic Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies, which are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form in which the free and poor people control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error to make the significance of the athic democracy due to these conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athic democracy was and is that it was the working poor, not only the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and crucial that they have the right to political co-determination in questions of state aid."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy did not have a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which lit very bright, it is also fast hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our modern liberal democracies did not present their roots in ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Charta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has been bordered to politics, while the economy - thus, the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was established."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies since the time, this separation from politics and economy began to immigrated a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy slowly migrated and deprived them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it cannot be in the government today, and yet it is not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hairs with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about such as a herd of carnivores which has thus sustainably the animals, of which it nourished, deceased that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far cannied by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows worse, inequality increases, the overall economic demand falling and the management of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism owes the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back and it would be better if the" demos "reserve control so as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea for 100 years ago and it wasn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglohnoccupied by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automating automate the twins increase, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it is - very soon as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and we consider that we end the reunited field of democracy, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that let the film" "matrix" "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interestingly question is whether capitalism is loosed through a diystopia, similar to the" "Star Trek", "in which machines serve man and people put their energy into the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Atheniener" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what did it mean, how could it look to have this" star Trek "" like utopia instead of the "" matrix "" similar hystone? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in the practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: put yourself a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derives from capital and dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction more between those who work the companies who do not work therein, and employees who work there are not. no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no emporaries between investment and austerity."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies should have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 major Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the whole world trade in this currency will be traded -- we call it" the Cosmos "," in units of "Cosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds in" green "technologies invests, especially in parts of the world, in which investment means are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a united policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberalization, in which they preferred to be privileged people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the sleeves of history, and keynesionic, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar diectopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we are working together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we are doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You set yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in general economic demand, which larry as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberalism is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"when this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>

<seg id="994">"in certain ways, if I may say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism - Liberal as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical as regards the democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="999">"now China now throw what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure many listener are curious about your experiences as the minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I imitated that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial that a massive displacement line passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the by the way, the first proposal that denial was revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to have chosen the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know yes, what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to obtain a economic system that is not excessive, through political will and authoritarianism alive, you might be able to delay it perhaps a while, but if then the change happens, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is likely to be responsible for 22-term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading attachter at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"it is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshed and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because it is responsible to choose the shows and the content to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the review is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad "," Game of Throne, "" The Wire "" -- all the shows, the addictive where, after you saw a relel, your brain asks, "Where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the turn. "</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to forbid" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thought about the average exploiting, average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they are simply not enthused."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right hand.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something special, that's why Roy price does not want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he requires a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and selects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can look at any free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives things out there, you can take a look, correct?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture, when you start the show when you pause, which parts you get skips or once more."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with this data which show them to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican U.S. transmitters. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"Alpha House," but Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House lanted at 7.5 -- i.e. something on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they show the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience, which shows they like, which producers, which actors have."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a vehicle and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has got a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go."</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic happens somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work so this is something terrifying, because we live in a time when we live more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in the US in prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, will decide whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data reversible companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009 Google announced that they can predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse way, they can predicate -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success shaded in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year round year round year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reverting companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather ensure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, like the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first step, you put this problem into its parts, so you can analyse the components; as a broad, you put the parts again together to get a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help solve a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that's good in which the brain is good, it is pieces and pieces come up again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to put a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, was Netflix so successful because they used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to better understand their audience, what else you would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all of these parts again, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," which does not stand in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first than they weathered around TV-ideas, then they elected" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say," this is telling us the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is pretty useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely, "- just here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later blaze it later with a technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have so far made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more actualizing, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball clumsy and clumsy and clumsy. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news, that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
